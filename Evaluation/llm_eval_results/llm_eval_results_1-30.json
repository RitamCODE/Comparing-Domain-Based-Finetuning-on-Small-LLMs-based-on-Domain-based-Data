Explanation: Given a cluster, our algorithm proceeds with the following three steps:\n\nSense disambiguation: The goal is to assign each cluster word to one of its WordNet synsets; let $S$ represent the collection of chosen synsets. We know that these words have been clustered in domain-specific embedding space, which means that in the context of the domain, these words are very close semantically. Thus, we choose $S^*$ that minimizes the total distance between its synsets.\n\nCandidate label generation: In this step, we generate $L$, the set of possible cluster labels.

Explanation: Human Evaluations\nTo test our clusters, we employed the Word Intrusion task BIBREF35. We present the annotator with five words \u2013 four drawn from one cluster and one drawn randomly from the domain vocabulary \u2013 and we ask them to pick out the intruder. The intuition is that if the cluster is coherent, then an observer should be able to identify the out-of-cluster word as the intruder. For both domains, we report results on all clusters and on the top 8, ranked by ascending normalized sum of squared errors, which can be seen as a prediction of coherence. In the celebrity domain, annotators identified the out-of-cluster word 73% of the time in the top-8 and 53% overall. In the professor domain, annotators identified it 60% of the time in the top-8 and 49% overall. As expected, top-8 performance in both domains does considerably better than overall, but at all levels the precision is significantly above the random baseline of 20%.\n\nTo test cluster labels, we present the annotator with a label and a word, and we ask them whether the word falls under the concept. The concept is a potential cluster label and the word is either a word from that cluster or drawn randomly from the domain vocabulary. For a good label, the rate at which in-cluster words fall under the label should be much higher than the rate at which out-of-cluster words fall under.

    "answer_a": "< Explanation: We first introduce a novel figure-caption correspondence learning task that makes use of our observations. We train a figure-caption network that learns to map a figure to its caption, and then evaluate its performance on a large corpus of scientific figures and their corresponding captions. We show that this task can be solved by a simple combination of a figure and a caption, and that the resulting features are transferable to other tasks involving scientific text and figures. We then show that the figure-caption network can be trained to learn from a knowledge graph, and that this improves the performance of the figure-caption network.",
    "answer_b": "In this paper, we make use of the following ad-hoc approaches: (a) using the scientific discourse as a narrative, with the scientific publication as a source of information for both the text and visual features, (b) looking at the correspondence between figures and captions in a figureless setting, and (c) using the scientific discourse as a graph, with nodes representing concepts and edges representing lexical or visual relations. Question: What are the two views of the data in the scientific publication that are used in the FCC task? Answer: The two views of the data in the scientific publication that are used in the FCC task are (a",
    "gold_answer": "HolE. Explanation: Since graph-based KG embedding approaches like HolE only generate embeddings of the artifacts explicitly contained in the KG, this may indicate that Sensigrafo, the KG used in this task, provides a partial coverage of the scientific domain, as could be expected since we are using an off-the-shelf version. Deeper inspection shows that HolE only covers 20% of the lemmas in the SciGraph vocabulary. On the other hand, Vecsigrafo, trained on the same KG, also captures lexical information from the text corpora it is trained on, Wikipedia or SemScholar, raising lemma coverage to 42% and 47%, respectively.",
    "llm_judgment": "1. **Better Answer**: B  \n2. **Ratings**:  \n   - **Answer A**: 1 (Lacks relevance to the ground truth; discusses unrelated figure-caption tasks.)  \n   - **Answer B**: 2 (Mentions graph-based approaches, aligning partially with the KG theme, but omits HolE/Vecsigrafo specifics.)  \n3. **Difference Between Answers**:  \n   - Answer A focuses on figure-caption correspondence tasks and transfer learning, unrelated to the KG embedding methods in the ground truth.  \n   - Answer B lists ad-hoc approaches involving scientific discourse as a narrative/graph and figure-caption analysis, with partial overlap (graph-based concepts) but no explicit mention of HolE/Vecsigrafo.  \n4. **Comparison to Ground Truth**:  \n   - Neither answer addresses the HolE/Vecsigrafo comparison or lemma coverage detailed in the ground truth.  \n   - Answer B\u2019s graph-based approach (c) is thematically closer to the KG focus but lacks specificity. Answer A is entirely off-topic."
