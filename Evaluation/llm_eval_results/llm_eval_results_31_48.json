We train a figure-caption network that learns to map a figure to its caption, and then evaluate its performance on a large corpus of scientific figures and their corresponding captions. We show that this task can be solved by a simple combination of a figure and a caption, and that the resulting features are transferable to other tasks involving scientific text and figures. We then show that the figure-caption network can be trained to learn from a knowledge graph, and that this improves the performance of the figure-caption network.",

    "gold_answer": "HolE. Explanation: Since graph-based KG embedding approaches like HolE only generate embeddings of the artifacts explicitly contained in the KG, this may indicate that Sensigrafo, the KG used in this task, provides a partial coverage of the scientific domain, as could be expected since we are using an off-the-shelf version. Deeper inspection shows that HolE only covers 20% of the lemmas in the SciGraph vocabulary. On the other hand, Vecsigrafo, trained on the same KG, also captures lexical information from the text corpora it is trained on, Wikipedia or SemScholar, raising lemma coverage to 42% and 47%, respectively.",

    "question": "What are the challenges associated with the use of Semantic Web technologies in Machine Translation?",
    "answer_a": "The main challenges associated with the use of Semantic Web technologies in Machine Translation are: 1. Ambiguity: MT systems struggle with translating words and phrases that have multiple interpretations due to the complexity of natural languages and their structure. This ambiguity problem is particularly challenging for low-resource language pairs such as African and South American languages. 2. Low-quality translations among morphologically rich languages: The problem of translating between languages with rich morphology is also present, as the syntax of these languages can be quite different from the English. 3. The need for domain-specific knowledge: MT systems require domain-specific knowledge to recognize and disambiguate words and phrases in",

    "gold_answer": "Excessive focus on English and European languages. Explanation: (1) Excessive focus on English and European languages as one of the involved languages in MT approaches and poor research on low-resource language pairs such as African and/or South American languages. (2) The limitations of SMT approaches for translating across domains. Most MT systems exhibit good performance on law and the legislative domains due to the large amount of data provided by the European Union. In contrast, translations performed on sports and life-hacks commonly fail, because of the lack of training data.

(4) The difficult translations among morphologically rich languages. This challenge shares the same problem with the first one, namely that most research work focuses on English as one of the involved languages.

    "question": "what eeg features were used?",
    "answer_a": "Explanation: The EEG signals were collected from the left and right earlobes of the subjects. The EEG signals were recorded using a 128 channel EEG amplifier (model: 128-128) with a sampling rate of 1000 Hz. The EEG signals were preprocessed using a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and a Butterworth low pass filter. The preprocessed EEG signals were then normalized to a range of -1 to 1.

    "gold_answer": "We extracted five statistical features for EEG, namely root mean square, zero crossing rate,moving window average,kurtosis and power spectral entropy BIBREF0. Explanation: EEG signals were sampled at 1000Hz and a fourth order IIR band pass filter with cut off frequencies 0.1Hz and 70Hz was applied. A notch filter with cut off frequency 60 Hz was used to remove the power line noise. EEGlab's BIBREF17 Independent component analysis (ICA) toolbox was used to remove other biological signal artifacts like electrocardiography (ECG), electromyography (EMG), electrooculography (EOG) etc from the EEG signals. We extracted five statistical features for EEG, namely root mean square, zero crossing rate,moving window average,kurtosis and power spectral entropy BIBREF0 . So in total we extracted 31(channels) X 5 or 155 features for EEG signals.The EEG features were extracted at a sampling frequency of 100Hz for each EEG channel.\n\nWe used spectral entropy because it captures the spectral ( frequency domain) and signal complexity information of EEG. It is also a widely used feature in EEG signal analysis BIBREF18 . Similarly zero crossing rate was chosen as it is a commonly used feature both for speech recognition and bio signal analysis. Remaining features were chosen to capture time domain statistical information. We performed lot of experiments to identify this set of features. Initially we used only spectral entropy and zero crossing rate but we noticed that the performance of the ASR system significantly went up by 20 % when we added the remaining additional features.\n\nThe recorded speech signal was sampled at 16KHz frequency. We extracted Mel-frequency cepstrum (MFCC) as features for speech signal. We first extracted MFCC 13 features and then computed first and second order differentials (delta and delta-delta) thus having total MFCC 39 features. The MFCC features were also sampled at 100Hz same as the sampling frequency of EEG features to avoid seq2seq problem.",
