Answer B is more focused on language and targeted harm but includes extraneous content about other questions.  \n4. **Comparison to Ground Truth**:  \n   - **Answer A**: Fails to capture the specificity of the ground truth (targeted groups, intent to insult/humiliate) and introduces inaccuracies (e.g., \"actions/behaviors\").  \n   - **Answer B**: Partially aligns with the ground truth (targeted groups, harm) but omits critical nuances (derogatory intent) and strays into unrelated topics."
