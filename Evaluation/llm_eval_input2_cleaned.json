    "gold_answer": "The authors contrasted human evaluations against a random baseline, and used the centroid of the cluster as a strong baseline.. Explanation: Human Evaluations\nTo test our clusters, we employed the Word Intrusion task BIBREF35. We present the annotator with five words \u2013 four drawn from one cluster and one drawn randomly from the domain vocabulary \u2013 and we ask them to pick out the intruder. The intuition is that if the cluster is coherent, then an observer should be able to identify the out-of-cluster word as the intruder. For both domains, we report results on all clusters and on the top 8, ranked by ascending normalized sum of squared errors, which can be seen as a prediction of coherence. In the celebrity domain, annotators identified the out-of-cluster word 73% of the time in the top-8 and 53% overall. In the professor domain, annotators identified it 60% of the time in the top-8 and 49% overall. As expected, top-8 performance in both domains does considerably better than overall, but at all levels the precision is significantly above the random baseline of 20%.\n\nTo test cluster labels, we present the annotator with a label and a word, and we ask them whether the word falls under the concept. The concept is a potential cluster label and the word is either a word from that cluster or drawn randomly from the domain vocabulary. For a good label, the rate at which in-cluster words fall under the label should be much higher than the rate at which out-of-cluster words fall under.

Explanation: EEG signals were sampled at 1000Hz and a fourth order IIR band pass filter with cut off frequencies 0.1Hz and 70Hz was applied. A notch filter with cut off frequency 60 Hz was used to remove the power line noise. EEGlab's BIBREF17 Independent component analysis (ICA) toolbox was used to remove other biological signal artifacts like electrocardiography (ECG), electromyography (EMG), electrooculography (EOG) etc from the EEG signals. We extracted five statistical features for EEG, namely root mean square, zero crossing rate,moving window average,kurtosis and power spectral entropy BIBREF0 . So in total we extracted 31(channels) X 5 or 155 features for EEG signals.The EEG features were extracted at a sampling frequency of 100Hz for each EEG channel.\n\nWe used spectral entropy because it captures the spectral ( frequency domain) and signal complexity information of EEG. It is also a widely used feature in EEG signal analysis BIBREF18 . Similarly zero crossing rate was chosen as it is a commonly used feature both for speech recognition and bio signal analysis. Remaining features were chosen to capture time domain statistical information. We performed lot of experiments to identify this set of features. Initially we used only spectral entropy and zero crossing rate but we noticed that the performance of the ASR system significantly went up by 20 % when we added the remaining additional features.\n\nThe recorded speech signal was sampled at 16KHz frequency. We extracted Mel-frequency cepstrum (MFCC) as features for speech signal. We first extracted MFCC 13 features and then computed first and second order differentials (delta and delta-delta) thus having total MFCC 39 features.

Explanation: At the first step, we include WordNet synonyms (including multiword expressions) into the proposed similarity sets (LDA-Sim+WNsyn). At this step, frequencies of synonyms found in the same document are summed up in process LDA topic learning as described in Algorithm SECREF3 . We can see that the kernel uniqueness becomes very low, topics are very close to each other in content (Table 2: LDA-Sim+WNsyn).

Explanation: Also, the model with the dataset vectors did not have the flexibility to classify unknown words.\n\nAs a next step, the test set of the dataset was altered by replacing words with syntactical mistakes to test the tolerance of the model in OOV words. Suffixes of verbs were altered and vowels were replaced with others, affecting 20% of the tokens of the dataset. Using again the more complex tagset for training, the results can be found in Table 3.\n\nWhat can be concluded is that the model did not have a flexibility in OOV words. Of course, this can also be an advantage, meaning that the model recognized the mismatch of a wrong word with its class.\n\nOne disadvantage that the previous model had is that for unknown words the model assigned a zero vector, affecting the testing results. In order to minimize this problem, the unknown words were first passed through a FastText model to get a vector from their subwords. The resulting vectors were imported in the vocabulary with the CC vectors before training. The model was also trained using as a vocabulary the unknown words and the tokens from the Common Crawl vectors, both buffered in the same FastText model.

Social networks encapsulate large volumes of data associated with diverse health topics, generated by active user bases in continuous growth. Twitter, for example, has 330 million monthly active users worldwide that generate almost 500 million micro-blogs (tweets) per day. For some years, the use of the platform to share personal health information has been growing, particularly amongst people living with one or more chronic conditions and those living with disability. Twenty percent of social network site users living with chronic conditions gather and share health information on the sites, compared with 12% of social network site users who report no chronic conditions. Social media data is thus being widely used for health-related research, for tasks such as adverse drug reaction detection BIBREF0, syndromic surveillance BIBREF1, subject recruitment for cancer trials BIBREF2, and characterizing drug abuse BIBREF3, to name a few. Twitter is particularly popular in research due to the availability of the public streaming API, which releases a sample of publicly posted data in real time.

The editors' annotations are not aligned with the keyphrases in the dataset. The dataset contains 100 keyphrases, and the annotations are aligned with the keyphrases in the dataset. The annotations are aligned to the keyphrases in the dataset by the following rules: (1) the first keyphrase is always the most important one, (2) the second",
    "answer_b": "The editors' annotations differ from those in existing datasets in that they are generally more constrained and include more frequent variations of keyphrase terms, as well as being less extractive in nature. This is due to the fact that the news articles are typically more comprehensive and detailed than those in scientific paper datasets, which makes it harder for annotators to generalize their annotations. In addition, the editors' annotations are obtained through a semi-automatic process, which may result in inconsistencies and typographical errors that need to be corrected before they can be used for training a deep learning model.

    "gold_answer": "Based on the number of stars users assign funny captions, an LSTM calculates the loss value L as an average of each mini-batch and returns  L when the number of stars is less than 100, otherwise L-1.0. Explanation: The Bokete Ogiri website uses the number of stars to evaluate the degree of funniness of a caption. The user evaluates the \u201cfunniness\u201d of a posted caption and assigns one to three stars to the caption. Therefore, funnier captions tend to be assigned a lot of stars. We focus on the number of stars in order to propose an effective training method, in which the Funny Score enables us to evaluate the funniness of a caption. Based on the results of our pre-experiment, a Funny Score of 100 stars is treated as a threshold. In other words, the Funny Score outputs a loss value INLINEFORM0 when #star is less than 100.

    "question": "What is the new metric?",
    "gold_answer": "They propose two new metrics. One, which they call the Neighbour Similarity Test, calculates how many shared characteristics there are between entities whose representations are neighbors in the embedding space. The second, which they call the Type and Category Test, is the same as the  Neighbour Similarity Test, except it uses entity types and categories in the place of individual entity characteristics.. Explanation: In this paper, we introduce two metrics inspired by The Identity of Indiscernibles BIBREF24 to gain insights over the distributional quality of the learned embeddings. The more characteristics two entities share, the more similar they are and so should be their vector representations. Considering the set of characteristics $C_K(s)=\\lbrace (p_1,o_1),\\dots ,(p_m,o_m)\\rbrace $ of a subject $s$ in a triple, we can define a metric that expresses the similarity among two entities $e_1,e_2$ as the Jaccard index between their sets of characteristics $C_K(e_1)$ and $C_K(e_2)$ . Given a set of entities $\\tilde{E}$ and their $N$ nearest neighbours in the vector space, the overall Neighbour Similarity Test (NST) metric is defined as:\n\n$$ NST(\\tilde{E},N,K) = \\frac{1}{N \\vert \\tilde{E} \\vert } \\sum _{e \\in \\tilde{E}} \\sum _{j=1}^N \\frac{\\vert C_K(e) \\cap C_K(n_j^{(e)}) \\vert }{\\vert C_K(e) \\cup C_K(n_j^{(e)}) \\vert }$$ (Eq. 19)\n\nwhere $n_j^{(e)}$ is the $j$ th nearest neighbour of $e$ in the vector space.\n\nThe second metric is the Type and Category Test (TCT), based on the assumption that two entities which share types and categories should be close in the vector space. This assumption is suggested by the human bias for which rdf:type and dct:subject would be predicates with a higher weight than the others. Although this does not happen, we compute it for a mere sake of comparison with the NST metric.

    "gold_answer": "They evaluated the majority of algorithms known at the time algorithms over meticulously prepared datasets, whose main strength was data cleaning, and by 1959 they have built a German-Russian machine translation prototype.. Explanation: In the USSR, there were four major approaches to machine translation in the late 1950s BIBREF7. The first one was the research at the Institute for Precise Mechanics and Computational Technology of the USSR Academy of Sciences. Their approach was mostly experimental and not much different from today's empirical methods. They evaluated the majority of algorithms known at the time algorithms over meticulously prepared datasets, whose main strength was data cleaning, and by 1959 they have built a German-Russian machine translation prototype. The second approach, as noted by Muli\u0107 BIBREF7, was championed by the team at the Steklov Mathematical Institute of the USSR Academy of Sciences led by A. A. Reformatsky. Their approach was mainly logical, and they extended the theoretical ideas of Bar-Hillel BIBREF2 to build three algorithms: French-Russian, English-Russian and Hungarian-Russian. The third and perhaps the most successful approach was the one by A. A. Lyapunov, O. S. Kulagina and R. L. Dobrushin. Their efforts resulted in the formation of the Mathematical Linguistics Seminar at the Faculty of Philology in Moscow in 1956 and in Leningrad in 1957. Their approach was mainly information-theoretic (but they also tried logic-based approaches BIBREF7), which was considered cybernetic at that time. This was the main role model for the Croatian efforts from 1957 onwards. The fourth, and perhaps most influential, was the approach at the Experimental Laboratory of the Leningrad University championed by N. D. Andreev BIBREF7. Here, the algorithms for Indonesian-Russian, Arabic-Russian, Hindu-Russian, Japanese-Russian, Burmese-Russian, Norwegian-Russian, English-Russian, Spanish-Russian and Turkish-Russian were being built. The main approach of Andreev's group was to use an intermediary language, which would capture the meanings BIBREF7. It was an approach similar to KL-ONE, which would be introduced in the West much later (in 1985) by Brachman and Schmolze BIBREF8. It is also interesting to note that the Andreev group had a profound influence on the Czechoslovakian machine translation program BIBREF9, which unfortunately suffered a similar fate as the Yugoslav one due to the lack of funding.",

Explanation: We investigated which features contribute most to the classification task to distinguish between radical and non-radical tweets. We used the mean decrease impurity method of random forests BIBREF27 to identify the most important features in each feature category. The ten most important features are shown in Table TABREF22 . We found that the most important feature for distinguishing radical tweets is the psychological feature distance measure. This measures how similar the Twitter user is to the average psychological profile calculated from the propaganda magazine articles. Following this is the Us-them dichotomy which looks at the total number of pronouns used (I,they, we, you).

We add a linear layer on top of BERT and we fine-tune it, as suggested in BIBREF12. For the FLC task, we feed the final hidden representation for each token to a layer $L_{g_2}$ that makes a 19-way classification: does this token belong to one of the eighteen propaganda techniques or to none of them (cf. Figure FIGREF7-a). For the SLC task, we feed the final hidden representation for the special [CLS] token, which BERT uses to represent the full sentence, to a two-dimensional layer $L_{g_1}$ to make a binary classification.\n\nBERT-Joint. We use the layers for both tasks in the BERT baseline, $L_{g_1}$ and $L_{g_2}$, and we train for both FLC and SLC jointly (cf. Figure FIGREF7-b).\n\nBERT-Granularity. We modify BERT-Joint to transfer information from SLC directly to FLC. Instead of using only the $L_{g_2}$ layer for FLC, we concatenate $L_{g_1}$ and $L_{g_2}$, and we add an extra 19-dimensional classification layer $L_{g_{1,2}}$ on top of that concatenation to perform the prediction for FLC (cf.

    "question": "How does proposed reinforcement learning based approach generate adversarial examples in black-box settings?",
    "gold_answer": "Training ::: Training with Reinforcement learning\nWe fine-tune our model to fool a target classifier by learning a policy that maximizes a specific discrete metric formulated based on the constraints required to generate adversarial examples. In our work, we use the self-critical approach of Rennie et al. BIBREF36 as our policy gradient training algorithm.\n\nTraining ::: Training with Reinforcement learning ::: Self-critical sequence training (SCST)\nIn SCST approach, the model learns to gather more rewards from its sampled sequences that bring higher rewards than its best greedy counterparts. First, we compute two sequences: (a) $y^{\\prime }$ sampled from the model's distribution $p(y^{\\prime }_j|y^{\\prime }_{. Explanation: Proposed Attack Strategy\nLet us consider a target model $T$ and $(x,l)$ refers to the samples from the dataset. Given an instance $x$, the goal of the adversary is to generate adversarial examples $x^{\\prime }$ such that $T(x^{\\prime }) \\ne l$, where $l$ denotes the true label i.e take one of the $K$ classes of the target classification model. The changes made to $x$ to get $x^{\\prime }$ are called perturbations. We would like to have $x^{\\prime }$ close to the original instance $x$. In a black box setting, we do not have knowledge about the internals of the target model or its training data. Previous work by Papernot et al. BIBREF14 train a separate substitute classifier such that it can mimic the decision boundaries of the target classifier. The substitute classifier is then used to craft adversarial examples. While these techniques have been applied for image classification models, such methods have not been explored extensively for text.\n\nWe implement both the substitute network training and adversarial example generation using an encoder-decoder architecture called Adversarial Examples Generator (AEG). The encoder extracts the character and word information from the input text and produces hidden representations of words considering its sequence context information. A substitute network is not implemented separately but applied using an attention mechanism to weigh the encoded hidden states based on their relevance to making predictions closer to target model outputs. The attention scores provide certain level of interpretability to the model as the regions of text that need to perturbed can be identified and visualized. The decoder uses the attention scores obtained from the substitute network, combines it with decoder state information to decide if perturbation is required at this state or not and finally emits the text unit (a text unit may refer to a word or character). Inspired by a work by Luong et al. BIBREF25, the decoder is a word and character-level recurrent network employed to generate adversarial examples. Before the substitute network is trained, we pretrain our encoder-decoder model on common misspellings and paraphrase datasets to empower the model to produce character and word perturbations in the form of misspellings or paraphrases. For training substitute network and generation of adversarial examples, we randomly draw data that is disjoint from the training data of the black-box model since we assume the adversaries have no prior knowledge about the training data or the model. Specifically, we consider attacking a target classifier by generating adversarial examples based on unseen input examples. This is done by dividing the dataset into training, validation and test using 60-30-10 ratio. The training data is used by the target model, while the unseen validation samples are used with necessary data augmentation for our AEG model. We further improve our model by using a self-critical approach to finally generate better adversarial examples. The rewards are formulated based on the following goals: (a) fool the target classifier, (b) minimize the number of perturbations and (c) preserve the semantics of the text.",

    "question": "What similarity metrics have been tried?",
    "gold_answer": "LM1: Significant Words Overlap. Explanation: When target domain data is labelled, we use the following four metrics for comparing and ranking source domains for a particular target domain:\n\nSimilarity Metrics ::: Metrics: Labelled Data ::: LM1: Significant Words Overlap\nAll words in a domain are not significant for sentiment expression. For example, comfortable is significant in the `Clothing' domain but not as significant in the `Movie' domain. In this metric, we build upon existing work by sharma2018identifying and extract significant words from each domain using the $\\chi ^2$ test. This method relies on computing the statistical significance of a word based on the polarity of that word in the domain. For our experiments, we consider only the words which appear at least 10 times in the corpus and have a $\\chi ^2$ value greater than or equal to 1. The $\\chi ^2$ value is calculated as follows:\n\nWhere ${c_p}^w$ and ${c_n}^w$ are the observed counts of word $w$ in positive and negative reviews, respectively. $\\mu ^w$ is the expected count, which is kept as half of the total number of occurrences of $w$ in the corpus. We hypothesize that, if a domain-pair $(D_1,D_2)$ shares a larger number of significant words than the pair $(D_1,D_3)$, then $D_1$ is closer to $D_2$ as compared to $D_3$, since they use relatively higher number of similar words for sentiment expression. For every target domain, we compute the intersection of significant words with all other domains and rank them on the basis of intersection count. The utility of this metric is that it can also be used in a scenario where target domain data is unlabelled, but source domain data is labelled. It is due to the fact that once we obtain significant words in the source domain, we just need to search for them in the target domain to find out common significant words.\n\nSimilarity Metrics ::: Metrics: Labelled Data ::: LM2: Symmetric KL-Divergence (SKLD)\nKL Divergence can be used to compare the probabilistic distribution of polar words in two domains BIBREF10. A lower KL Divergence score indicates that the probabilistic distribution of polar words in two domains is identical. This implies that the domains are close to each other, in terms of sentiment similarity. Therefore, to rank source domains for a target domain using this metric, we inherit the concept of symmetric KL Divergence proposed by murthy2018judicious and use it to compute average Symmetric KL-Divergence of common polar words shared by a domain-pair. We label a word as `polar' for a domain if,\n\nwhere $P$ is the probability of a word appearing in a review which is labelled positive and $N$ is the probability of a word appearing in a review which is labelled negative.\n\nSKLD of a polar word for domain-pair $(D_1,D_2)$ is calculated as:\n\nwhere $P_i$ and $N_i$ are probabilities of a word appearing under positively labelled and negatively labelled reviews, respectively, in domain $i$. We then take an average of all common polar words.\n\nWe observe that, on its own, this metric performs rather poorly. Upon careful analysis of results, we concluded that the imbalance in the number of polar words being shared across domain-pairs is a reason for poor performance. To mitigate this, we compute a confidence term for a domain-pair $(D_1,D_2)$ using the Jaccard Similarity Coefficient which is calculated as follows:\n\nwhere $C$ is the number of common polar words and $W_1$ and $W_2$ are number of polar words in $D_1$ and $D_2$ respectively. The intuition behind this being that the domain-pairs having higher percentage of polar words overlap should be ranked higher compared to those having relatively higher number of polar words. For example, we prefer $(C:40,W_1 :50,W_2 :50)$ over $(C:200,W_1 :500,W_2 :500)$ even though 200 is greater than 40. To compute the final similarity value, we add the reciprocal of $J$ to the SKLD value since a larger value of $J$ will add a smaller fraction to SLKD value. For a smaller SKLD value, the domains would be relatively more similar. This is computed as follows:\n\nDomain pairs are ranked in increasing order of this similarity value. After the introduction of the confidence term, a significant improvement in the results is observed.\n\nSimilarity Metrics ::: Metrics: Labelled Data ::: LM3: Chameleon Words Similarity\nThis metric is our novel contribution for domain adaptability evaluation. It helps in detection of `Chameleon Word(s)' which change their polarity across domains BIBREF11. The motivation comes from the fact that chameleon words directly affect the CDSA accuracy. For example, poignant is positive in movie domain whereas negative in many other domains viz. Beauty, Clothing etc.\n\nFor every common polar word between two domains, $L_1 \\ Distance$ between two vectors $[P_1,N_1]$ and $[P_2,N_2]$ is calculated as;\n\nThe overall distance is an average overall common polar words. Similar to SKLD, the confidence term based on Jaccard Similarity Coefficient is used to counter the imbalance of common polar word count between domain-pairs.\n\nDomain pairs are ranked in increasing order of final value.\n\nSimilarity Metrics ::: Metrics: Labelled Data ::: LM4: Entropy Change\nEntropy is the degree of randomness. A relatively lower change in entropy, when two domains are concatenated, indicates that the two domains contain similar topics and are therefore closer to each other. This metric is also our novel contribution. Using this metric, we calculate the percentage change in the entropy when the target domain is concatenated with the source domain. We calculate the entropy as the combination of entropy for unigrams, bigrams, trigrams, and quadrigrams. We consider only polar words for unigrams. For bi, tri and quadrigrams, we give priority to polar words by using a weighted entropy function and this weighted entropy $E$ is calculated as:\n\nHere, $X$ is the set of n-grams that contain at least one polar word, $Y$ is the set of n-grams which do not contain any polar word, and $w$ is the weight. For our experiments, we keep the value of $w$ as 1 for unigrams and 5 for bi, tri, and quadrigrams.\n\nWe then say that a source domain $D_2$ is more suitable for target domain $D_1$ as compared to source domain $D_3$ if;\n\nwhere $D_2+D_1$ indicates combined data obtained by mixing $D_1$ in $D_2$ and $\\Delta E$ indicates percentage change in entropy before and after mixing of source and target domains.\n\nNote that this metric offers the advantage of asymmetricity, unlike the other three metrics for labelled data.",

In self-critical sequence training, the REINFORCE algorithm BIBREF20 is used by modifying its baseline as the greedy output of the current model. At each time-step $t$, the model predicts two words: $\\hat{y}_{t}$ sampled from $p(\\hat{y}_{t} | \\hat{y}_{1}, \\hat{y}_{2}, ..., \\hat{y}_{t-1}, x)$, the baseline output that is greedily generated by considering the most probable word from the vocabulary and $\\tilde{y}_{t}$ sampled from the $p(\\tilde{y}_{t} | \\tilde{y}_{1}, \\tilde{y}_{2}, ..., \\tilde{y}_{t-1}, x)$. This model is trained using the following loss function:\n\nUsing the above training objective, the model learns to generate samples with high probability and thereby increasing $r(\\tilde{y})$ above $r(\\hat{y})$. Additionally, we have used enthttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/19053077/looping-over-data-and-creating-individual-figuresropy regularization.\n\nWhere, $p(\\tilde{y}_{t})=p(\\tilde{y}_{t} | \\tilde{y}_{1}, \\tilde{y}_{2}, ..., \\tilde{y}_{t-1}, x)$ is the sampling probability and $V$ is the size of the vocabulary. It is similar to the exploration-exploitation trade-off. $\\alpha $ is the regularization coefficient that explicitly controls this trade-off: a higher $\\alpha $ corresponds to more exploration, and a lower $\\alpha $ corresponds to more exploitation.

    "gold_answer": "Vanilla VQA. Explanation: The emergence of deep-learning architectures have led to the development of the VQA systems. We discuss the state-of-the-art methods with an overview in Table TABREF6.\n\nVanilla VQA BIBREF0: Considered as a benchmark for deep learning methods, the vanilla VQA model uses CNN for feature extraction and LSTM or Recurrent networks for language processing. These features are combined using element-wise operations to a common feature, which is used to classify to one of the answers as shown in Fig. FIGREF4.\n\nStacked Attention Networks BIBREF11: This model introduced the attention using the softmax output of the intermediate question feature. The attention between the features are stacked which helps the model to focus on the important portion of the image.\n\nTeney et al. Model BIBREF13: Teney et al. introduced the use of object detection on VQA models and won the VQA Challenge 2017. The model helps in narrowing down the features and apply better attention to images. The model employs the use of R-CNN architecture and showed significant performance in accuracy over other architectures.\n\nNeural-Symbolic VQA BIBREF23: Specifically made for CLEVR dataset, this model leverages the question formation and image generation strategy of CLEVR. The images are converted to structured features and the question features are converted to their original root question strategy. This feature is used to filter out the required answer.\n\nFocal Visual Text Attention (FVTA) BIBREF24: This model combines the sequence of image features generated by the network, text features of the image (or probable answers) and the question. It applies the attention based on the both text components, and finally classifies the features to answer the question. This model is better suited for the VQA in videos which has more use cases than images.\n\nPythia v1.0 BIBREF27: Pythia v1.0 is the award winning architecture for VQA Challenge 2018. The architecture is similar to Teney et al. BIBREF13 with reduced computations with element-wise multiplication, use of GloVe vectors BIBREF22, and ensemble of 30 models.\n\nDifferential Networks BIBREF19: This model uses the differences between forward propagation steps to reduce the noise and to learn the interdependency between features. Image features are extracted using Faster-RCNN BIBREF21. The differential modules BIBREF29 are used to refine the features in both text and images. GRU BIBREF30 is used for question feature extraction. Finally, it is combined with an attention module to classify the answers.

The result table TABREF28 shows three columns based on the three evaluation metrics that the organisers have used. Metric 1 is the original metric, weighted cosine similarity (the metric used to evaluate the final version of the results, where we were ranked 5th; metric provided on the task website). This was then changed after the evaluation deadline to equation EQREF25 (which we term metric 2; this is what the first version of the results were actually based on, where we were ranked 4th), which then changed by the organisers to their equation as presented in BIBREF18 (which we term metric 3 and what the second version of the results were based on, where we were ranked 5th).\n\nAs you can see from the results table TABREF28 , the difference between the metrics is quite substantial. This is due to the system's optimisation being based on metric 1 rather than 2. Metric 2 is a classification metric for sentences with one aspect as it penalises values that are of opposite sign (giving -1 score) and rewards values with the same sign (giving +1 score). Our systems are not optimised for this because it would predict scores of -0.01 and true value of 0.01 as very close (within vector of other results) with low error whereas metric 2 would give this the highest error rating of -1 as they are not the same sign. Metric 3 is more similar to metric 1 as shown by the results, however the crucial difference is that again if you get opposite signs it will penalise more. We analysed the top 50 errors based on Mean Absolute Error (MAE) in the test dataset specifically to examine the number of sentences containing more than one aspect. Our investigation shows that no one system is better at predicting the sentiment of sentences that have more than one aspect (i.e. company) within them. Within those top 50 errors we found that the BLSTM systems do not know which parts of the sentence are associated to the company the sentiment is with respect to.

Indeed, this approximation will only cause errors for the very few words which occur near the beginning or the end of the text. Take for example the text appearing above - the bigram (doggies, *) does not occur once, but the approximation says it does.\n\nAn efficient method for computing the contingency matrix for a bigram (word1, word2) is suggested by the approximation. Store $freq(w1, w2)$ for all bigrams $(w1, w2)$ and the frequencies of all words. Then,\n\nThe statistical importance of miscalculations due to this method diminishes as our text grows larger and larger. Interest is growing in the analysis of small texts, however, and a means of computing bigrams for this type of corpus must be employed.

Consider the simple RNN with INLINEFORM0 as its INLINEFORM1 -language described in the proof of Theorem 1.1 and the simple RNN with INLINEFORM2 as its INLINEFORM3 -language constructed to prove Theorem 1.10. Merge the INLINEFORM4 nodes in the input layer corresponding to the input and merge the single output nodes of both RNNs. Stack the two hidden layers, and add no new edges.

Explanation: Document-level text manipulation experimental results are given in Table 2. The first block shows two slot filling methods, which can reach the maximum BLEU (100) after masking out record tokens. It is because that both methods only replace records without modifying other parts of the reference text. Moreover, Copy-SF achieves reasonably good performance on multiple metrics, setting a strong baseline for content fidelity and content selection. For two data-to-text generation methods CCDT and HEDT, the latter one is consistently better than the former, which verifies the proposed hierarchical record encoder is more powerful. However, their Style BLEU scores are particularly low, which demonstrates that direct supervised learning is incapable of controlling the text expression.

Explanation: We compare with the following baseline methods on the document-level text manipulation.\n\n(1) Rule-based Slot Filling Method (Rule-SF) is a straightforward way for text manipulation. Firstly, It masks the record information $x^{\\prime }$ in the $y^{\\prime }$ and build a mapping between $x$ and $x^{\\prime }$ through their data types. Afterwards, select the suitable records from $x$ to fill in the reference y with masked slots. The method is also used in sentence-level task BIBREF1.\n\n(2) Copy-based Slot Filling Method (Copy-SF) is a data-driven slot filling method. It is derived from BIBREF21, which first generates a template text with data slots to be filled and then leverages a delayed copy mechanism to fill in the slots with proper data records.\n\n(3) Conditional Copy based Data-To-Text (CCDT) is a classical neural model for data-to-text generation BIBREF10. (4) Hierarchical Encoder for Data-To-Text (HEDT) is also a data-to-text method, which adopts the same hierarchical encoder in our model.\n\n(5) Text Manipulation with Table Encoder (TMTE) extends sentence-level text editing method BIBREF1 by equipping a more powerful hierarchical table encoder.\n\n(6) Co-attention-based Method (Coatt): a variation of our model by replacing interactive attention with another co-attention model BIBREF22.\n\n(7) Ours w/o Interactive Attention (-InterAtt) is our model without interactive attention.\n\n(8) Ours w/o Back-translation (-BackT) is also a variation of our model by omitting back-translation loss.\n\nIn addition, for sentence-level task, we adopt the same baseline methods as the paper BIBREF1, including an attention-based Seq2Seq method with copy mechanism BIBREF23, a rule-based method, two style transfer methods, MAST BIBREF24 and AdvST BIBREF25, as well as their state-of-the-art method, abbreviate as S-SOTA.",

Explanation: Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a fundamental step for most of the information extraction pipelines. Importantly, the terse and difficult text style of tweets presents serious challenges to NER systems, which are usually trained using more formal text sources such as newswire articles or Wikipedia entries that follow particular morpho-syntactic rules. As a result, off-the-self tools trained on such data perform poorly BIBREF0 .

Explanation: In this work, we utilize a white-box method working on the embedding level.

Assuming $p(y|x;\\theta )$ is the probability of label $y$ given the input $x$ and the model parameters $\\theta $, in order to find the adversarial examples the following minimization problem should be solved:\n\nwhere $r$ denotes the perturbations on the input and $\\hat{\\theta }$ is a constant copy of $\\theta $ in order not to allow the gradients to propagate in the process of constructing the artificial examples. Solving the above minimization problem means that we are searching for the worst perturbations while trying to minimize the loss of the model.

    "question": "How are biases identified in the dataset?",
    "gold_answer": "we feed the five strong baseline models (GPT, GPT-2, BERT$_{\\small \\textsc {BASE}}$, XLNet$_{\\small \\textsc {BASE}}$ and RoBERTa$_{\\small \\textsc {BASE}}$) with ONLY THE ANSWER OPTIONS for each problem. Explanation: As mentioned earlier, biases prevalently exist in human-annotated datasets BIBREF16, BIBREF17, BIBREF18, BIBREF42, which are often exploited by models to perform well without truly understanding the text. Therefore, it is necessary to find out the biased data points in ReClor in order to evaluate models in a more comprehensive manner BIBREF43. To this end, we feed the five strong baseline models (GPT, GPT-2, BERT$_{\\small \\textsc {BASE}}$, XLNet$_{\\small \\textsc {BASE}}$ and RoBERTa$_{\\small \\textsc {BASE}}$) with ONLY THE ANSWER OPTIONS for each problem. In other words, we purposely remove the context and question in the inputs. In this way, we are able to identify those problems that can be answered correctly by merely exploiting the biases in answer options without knowing the relevant context and question. However, the setting of this task is a multiple-choice question with 4 probable options, and even a chance baseline could have 25% probability to get it right. To eliminate the effect of random guess, we set four different random seeds for each model and pick the data points that are predicted correctly in all four cases to form the EASY set. Then, the data points which are predicted correctly by the models at random could be nearly eliminated, since any data point only has a probability of $(25\\%)^{4}=0.39\\%$ to be guessed right consecutively for four times. Then we unite the sets of data points that are consistently predicted right by each model, because intuitively different models may learn different biases of the dataset.",

    "gold_answer": "Face tracking is performed in an automatic tracklet module, face identification is performed by creating a face embedding from the output of a CNN, the embedding is then compared to a gallery of each person's face using a discriminative classifier (SVM) and localization is modelled with a complex angular central Gaussian model. All are merged in a statistical model.. Explanation: The unconstrained meeting scenario involves many challenges, including face occlusions, extreme head pose, lighting conditions, compression artifacts, low resolution due to device-to-person distances, motion blur. Therefore, any individual frame may not contain necessary information. For example, a face may not be detectable in some frames. Even if it is detectable, it may not be recognizable.\n\nTo handle this variability, we integrate information across time using face tracking as implied by our formulation of $P(h | r, V)$, which requires face identification to be performed only at a tracklet level. Our face tracking uses face detection and low-level tracking to maintain a set of tracklets, where each tracklet is defined as a sequence of faces in time that belong to the same person. We use a method similar to that in BIBREF50 with several adaptions to our specific setting, such as exploiting the stationarity of the camera for detecting motion, performing the low-level tracking by color based mean-shift instead of gray-level based normalized correlation, tuning the algorithm to minimize the risk of tracklet mergers (which in our context are destructive), etc. Also, the faces in each tracklet are augmented with attributes such as face position, dimensions, head pose, and face feature vectors.
