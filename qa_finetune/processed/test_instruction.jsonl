As a result, compared to collaborate tasks, people use social content to build rapport and trust in these non-collaborative settings in order to advance their goals. To handle social content, we introduce a hierarchical intent annotation scheme, which can be generalized to different non-collaborative dialog tasks. Building upon TransferTransfo (Wolf et al. 2019), we propose an end-to-end neural network model to generate diverse coherent responses.

In addition, we design a filter to select appropriate responses based on whether these intermediate representations fit the designed task and conversation constraints. Our non-collaborative dialog model guides users to complete the task while simultaneously keeps them engaged.

Explanation: Human Evaluations\nTo test our clusters, we employed the Word Intrusion task BIBREF35. We present the annotator with five words \u2013 four drawn from one cluster and one drawn randomly from the domain vocabulary \u2013 and we ask them to pick out the intruder. The intuition is that if the cluster is coherent, then an observer should be able to identify the out-of-cluster word as the intruder. For both domains, we report results on all clusters and on the top 8, ranked by ascending normalized sum of squared errors, which can be seen as a prediction of coherence. In the celebrity domain, annotators identified the out-of-cluster word 73% of the time in the top-8 and 53% overall. In the professor domain, annotators identified it 60% of the time in the top-8 and 49% overall. As expected, top-8 performance in both domains does considerably better than overall, but at all levels the precision is significantly above the random baseline of 20%.\n\nTo test cluster labels, we present the annotator with a label and a word, and we ask them whether the word falls under the concept. The concept is a potential cluster label and the word is either a word from that cluster or drawn randomly from the domain vocabulary. For a good label, the rate at which in-cluster words fall under the label should be much higher than the rate at which out-of-cluster words fall under.

To answer this question, we conduct a large-scale crowd-sourced evaluation of abuse response strategies employed by current state-of-the-art systems. Our results show that some strategies, such as \"polite refusal\" score highly across the board, while for other strategies demographic factors, such as age, as well as the severity of the preceding abuse influence the user's perception of which response is appropriate. In addition, we find that most data-driven models lag behind rule-based or commercial systems in terms of their perceived appropriateness.\nQuestion: How do data-driven models usually respond to abuse?", "output": "either by refusing politely, or, with flirtatious responses, or, by retaliating.

Explanation: We use three types of units: (1) words (2) characters and character sequences and (3) outputs of morphological analysis. Words serve as a lower bound; while morphology is used as an upper bound for comparison. Table 1 shows sample outputs of various $\\rho $ functions.\n\nHere, char function simply splits the token into its characters. Similar to n-gram language models, char3 slides a character window of width $n=3$ over the token. Finally, gold morphological features are used as outputs of morph-language. Throughout this paper, we use morph and oracle interchangably, i.e., morphology-level models (MLM) have access to gold tags unless otherwise is stated. For all languages, morph outputs the lemma of the token followed by language specific morphological tags. As an exception, it outputs additional information for some languages, such as parts-of-speech tags for Turkish. Word segmenters such as Morfessor and Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) are other commonly used subword units. Due to low scores obtained from our preliminary experiments and unsatisfactory results from previous studies BIBREF13 , we excluded these units."}

Deeper inspection shows that HolE only covers 20% of the lemmas in the SciGraph vocabulary.

Explanation: (1) Excessive focus on English and European languages as one of the involved languages in MT approaches and poor research on low-resource language pairs such as African and/or South American languages. (2) The limitations of SMT approaches for translating across domains. Most MT systems exhibit good performance on law and the legislative domains due to the large amount of data provided by the European Union. In contrast, translations performed on sports and life-hacks commonly fail, because of the lack of training data. (3) How to translate the huge amount of data from social networks that uniquely deal with no-standard speech texts from users (e.g., tweets). (4) The difficult translations among morphologically rich languages. This challenge shares the same problem with the first one, namely that most research work focuses on English as one of the involved languages. Therefore, MT systems which translate content between, for instance, Arabic and Spanish are rare.

{"input": "In this paper we demonstrate end to end continuous speech recognition (CSR) using electroencephalography (EEG) signals with no speech signal as input. An attention model based automatic speech recognition (ASR) and connectionist temporal classification (CTC) based ASR systems were implemented for performing recognition. We further demonstrate CSR for noisy speech by fusing with EEG features.\nQuestion: what eeg features were used?", "output": "We extracted five statistical features for EEG, namely root mean square, zero crossing rate,moving window average,kurtosis and power spectral entropy BIBREF0. Explanation: EEG signals were sampled at 1000Hz and a fourth order IIR band pass filter with cut off frequencies 0.1Hz and 70Hz was applied. A notch filter with cut off frequency 60 Hz was used to remove the power line noise. EEGlab's BIBREF17 Independent component analysis (ICA) toolbox was used to remove other biological signal artifacts like electrocardiography (ECG), electromyography (EMG), electrooculography (EOG) etc from the EEG signals. We extracted five statistical features for EEG, namely root mean square, zero crossing rate,moving window average,kurtosis and power spectral entropy BIBREF0 . So in total we extracted 31(channels) X 5 or 155 features for EEG signals.The EEG features were extracted at a sampling frequency of 100Hz for each EEG channel.\n\nWe used spectral entropy because it captures the spectral ( frequency domain) and signal complexity information of EEG. It is also a widely used feature in EEG signal analysis BIBREF18 . Similarly zero crossing rate was chosen as it is a commonly used feature both for speech recognition and bio signal analysis. Remaining features were chosen to capture time domain statistical information. We performed lot of experiments to identify this set of features. Initially we used only spectral entropy and zero crossing rate but we noticed that the performance of the ASR system significantly went up by 20 % when we added the remaining additional features.\n\nThe recorded speech signal was sampled at 16KHz frequency. We extracted Mel-frequency cepstrum (MFCC) as features for speech signal. We first extracted MFCC 13 features and then computed first and second order differentials (delta and delta-delta) thus having total MFCC 39 features. The MFCC features were also sampled at 100Hz same as the sampling frequency of EEG features to avoid seq2seq problem."}

{"input": "BERT is a cutting-edge language representation model pre-trained by a large corpus, which achieves superior performances on various natural language understanding tasks. However, a major blocking issue of applying BERT to online services is that it is memory-intensive and leads to unsatisfactory latency of user requests, raising the necessity of model compression. Existing solutions leverage the knowledge distillation framework to learn a smaller model that imitates the behaviors of BERT. However, the training procedure of knowledge distillation is expensive itself as it requires sufficient training data to imitate the teacher model. In this paper, we address this issue by proposing a hybrid solution named LadaBERT (Lightweight adaptation of BERT through hybrid model compression), which combines the advantages of different model compression methods, including weight pruning, matrix factorization and knowledge distillation. LadaBERT achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on various public datasets while the training overheads can be reduced by an order of magnitude.\nQuestion: On which datasets does LadaBERT achieve state-of-the-art?", "output": "MNLI-m, MNLI-mm, SST-2, QQP, QNLI.

{"input": "Detecting controversy in general web pages is a daunting task, but increasingly essential to efficiently moderate discussions and effectively filter problematic content. Unfortunately, controversies occur across many topics and domains, with great changes over time. This paper investigates neural classifiers as a more robust methodology for controversy detection in general web pages. Current models have often cast controversy detection on general web pages as Wikipedia linking, or exact lexical matching tasks. The diverse and changing nature of controversies suggest that semantic approaches are better able to detect controversy. We train neural networks that can capture semantic information from texts using weak signal data. By leveraging the semantic properties of word embeddings we robustly improve on existing controversy detection methods. To evaluate model stability over time and to unseen topics, we asses model performance under varying training conditions to test cross-temporal, cross-topic, cross-domain performance and annotator congruence. In doing so, we demonstrate that weak-signal based neural approaches are closer to human estimates of controversy and are more robust to the inherent variability of controversies.\nQuestion: Which model architecture do they opt for?", "output": "Recurrent Neural Networks. Explanation: We use two often applied network architectures adopting word embeddings, to classify controversy: Recurrent Neural Networks BIBREF10 and Convolutional Neural Networks BIBREF11 to answer the following research question."}

{"input": "Many predictive tasks, such as diagnosing a patient based on their medical chart, are ultimately defined by the decisions of human experts. Unfortunately, encoding experts' knowledge is often time consuming and expensive. We propose a simple way to use fuzzy and informal knowledge from experts to guide discovery of interpretable latent topics in text. The underlying intuition of our approach is that latent factors should be informative about both correlations in the data and a set of relevance variables specified by an expert. Mathematically, this approach is a combination of the information bottleneck and Total Correlation Explanation (CorEx). We give a preliminary evaluation of Anchored CorEx, showing that it produces more coherent and interpretable topics on two distinct corpora.\nQuestion: How do they incorporate expert knowledge into their topic model?", "output": "The experts define anchors and the model learns correlations between the anchors and latent topics..

{"input": "We focus on named entity recognition (NER) for Chinese social media. With massive unlabeled text and quite limited labelled corpus, we propose a semi-supervised learning model based on B-LSTM neural network. To take advantage of traditional methods in NER such as CRF, we combine transition probability with deep learning in our model. To bridge the gap between label accuracy and F-score of NER, we construct a model which can be directly trained on F-score. When considering the instability of F-score driven method and meaningful information provided by label accuracy, we propose an integrated method to train on both F-score and label accuracy. Our integrated model yields 7.44\\% improvement over previous state-of-the-art result.\nQuestion: What is F-score obtained?", "output": "For Named Entity, F-Score Driven I model had 49.40 F1 score,  and F-Score Driven II model had 50.60  F1 score. In case of Nominal Mention, the scores were 58.16 and 59.32. Explanation: Table TABREF23 shows results for NER on test sets. In the Table TABREF23 , we also show micro F1-score (Overall) and out-of-vocabulary entities (OOV) recall. Peng and Dredze peng-dredze:2016:P16-2 is the state-of-the-art NER system in Chinese Social media.

The integrated training model (F-Score Driven Model II) benefits from both label accuracy and F-Score, which achieves a new state-of-the-art NER system in Chinese social media.

Recent work on models that have access to information across sentence boundaries has seen only moderate improvements in terms of automatic evaluation metrics such as BLEU.

{"input": "In comparison with document summarization on the articles from social media and newswire, argumentative zoning (AZ) is an important task in scientific paper analysis. Traditional methodology to carry on this task relies on feature engineering from different levels. In this paper, three models of generating sentence vectors for the task of sentence classification were explored and compared. The proposed approach builds sentence representations using learned embeddings based on neural network. The learned word embeddings formed a feature space, to which the examined sentence is mapped to. Those features are input into the classifiers for supervised classification. Using 10-cross-validation scheme, evaluation was conducted on the Argumentative-Zoning (AZ) annotated articles. The results showed that simply averaging the word vectors in a sentence works better than the paragraph to vector algorithm and by integrating specific cuewords into the loss function of the neural network can improve the classification performance.

{"input": "Online social media platforms have made the world more connected than ever before, thereby making it easier for everyone to spread their content across a wide variety of audiences. Twitter is one such popular platform where people publish tweets to spread their messages to everyone. Twitter allows users to Retweet other users' tweets in order to broadcast it to their network. The more retweets a particular tweet gets, the faster it spreads. This creates incentives for people to obtain artificial growth in the reach of their tweets by using certain blackmarket services to gain inorganic appraisals for their content. In this paper, we attempt to detect such tweets that have been posted on these blackmarket services in order to gain artificially boosted retweets. We use a multitask learning framework to leverage soft parameter sharing between a classification and a regression based task on separate inputs. This allows us to effectively detect tweets that have been posted to these blackmarket services, achieving an F1-score of 0.89 when classifying tweets as blackmarket or genuine.\nQuestion: How did they obtain the tweets?", "output": "crawled two blackmarket sites. Explanation: We crawled two blackmarket sites \u2013 YouLikeHits and Like4Like, between the period of February and April 2019.

However, existing models remain unfit for real-world applications, largely due to a shortage of publicly available training data and a lack of standard criteria for assigning ground truth labels. In this study, we address the need for reliable data using an original annotation framework. Inspired by social sciences research into bullying behavior, we characterize the nuanced problem of cyberbullying using five explicit factors to represent its social and linguistic aspects. We model this behavior using social network and language-based features, which improve classifier performance.

The user either addresses a group or individual, and the message contains at least one phrase that could be described as confrontational, derogatory, insulting, threatening, hostile, violent, hateful, or sexually abusive.\n\nRepetition: (rep) The target user has received at least two aggressive messages in total (either from the author or from another user in the visible thread).\n\nHarmful intent: (harm) The tweet was designed to tear down or disadvantage the target user by causing them distress or by harming their public image. The target does not respond agreeably as to a joke or an otherwise lighthearted comment.\n\nVisibility among peers: (peer) At least one other user besides the target has liked, retweeted, or responded to at least one of the author's messages.\n\nPower imbalance: (power) Power is derived from authority and perceived social advantage. Celebrities and public figures are more powerful than common users. Minorities and disadvantaged groups have less power. Bullies can also derive power from peer support."}

These feature maps are reconstructed into corresponding capsules which are then routed to another capsule to produce a continuous vector. The length of this vector is used to measure the plausibility score of the triple.

However, researchers still know relatively little regarding their theoretical and empirical properties. In this regard, Peters et al. perform several experiments which demonstrate that it is better to adapt BERT with a light-weight task-specific head, rather than building a complex one on top of the pre-trained language model, and freeze the parameters in the said language model. However, there is another option to adopt. In this paper, we propose a new adaptation method which we first train the task model with the BERT parameters frozen and then fine-tune the entire model together.

{"input": "Distantly supervised relation extraction intrinsically suffers from noisy labels due to the strong assumption of distant supervision. Most prior works adopt a selective attention mechanism over sentences in a bag to denoise from wrongly labeled data, which however could be incompetent when there is only one sentence in a bag. In this paper, we propose a brand-new light-weight neural framework to address the distantly supervised relation extraction problem and alleviate the defects in previous selective attention framework. Specifically, in the proposed framework, 1) we use an entity-aware word embedding method to integrate both relative position information and head/tail entity embeddings, aiming to highlight the essence of entities for this task; 2) we develop a self-attention mechanism to capture the rich contextual dependencies as a complement for local dependencies captured by piecewise CNN; and 3) instead of using selective attention, we design a pooling-equipped gate, which is based on rich contextual representations, as an aggregator to generate bag-level representation for final relation classification. Compared to selective attention, one major advantage of the proposed gating mechanism is that, it performs stably and promisingly even if only one sentence appears in a bag and thus keeps the consistency across all training examples.

{"input": "In this paper we present the approach of introducing thesaurus knowledge into probabilistic topic models. The main idea of the approach is based on the assumption that the frequencies of semantically related words and phrases, which are met in the same texts, should be enhanced: this action leads to their larger contribution into topics found in these texts. We have conducted experiments with several thesauri and found that for improving topic models, it is useful to utilize domain-specific knowledge. If a general thesaurus, such as WordNet, is used, the thesaurus-based improvement of topic models can be achieved with excluding hyponymy relations in combined topic models.\nQuestion: Do they reduce language variation of text by enhancing frequencies?", "output": "Variation decreases when frequencies of synonyms is enhanced; variation increases when frequencies of synonyms, hyponyms, hypernyms are enhanced. Explanation: At the first step, we include WordNet synonyms (including multiword expressions) into the proposed similarity sets (LDA-Sim+WNsyn). At this step, frequencies of synonyms found in the same document are summed up in process LDA topic learning as described in Algorithm SECREF3 . We can see that the kernel uniqueness becomes very low, topics are very close to each other in content (Table 2: LDA-Sim+WNsyn). At the second step, we add word direct relatives (hyponyms, hypernyms, etc.) to similarity sets. Now the frequencies of semantically related words are added up enhancing the contribution into all topics of the current document."}

{"input": "A key challenge for automatic hate-speech detection on social media is the separation of hate speech from other instances of offensive language. Lexical detection methods tend to have low precision because they classify all messages containing particular terms as hate speech and previous work using supervised learning has failed to distinguish between the two categories. We used a crowd-sourced hate speech lexicon to collect tweets containing hate speech keywords. We use crowd-sourcing to label a sample of these tweets into three categories: those containing hate speech, only offensive language, and those with neither. We train a multi-class classifier to distinguish between these different categories. Close analysis of the predictions and the errors shows when we can reliably separate hate speech from other offensive language and when this differentiation is more difficult. We find that racist and homophobic tweets are more likely to be classified as hate speech but that sexist tweets are generally classified as offensive. Tweets without explicit hate keywords are also more difficult to classify.\nQuestion: What is their definition of hate speech?", "output": "language that is used to expresses hatred towards a targeted group or is intended to be derogatory, to humiliate, or to insult the members of the group.

{"input": "A key challenge for automatic hate-speech detection on social media is the separation of hate speech from other instances of offensive language. Lexical detection methods tend to have low precision because they classify all messages containing particular terms as hate speech and previous work using supervised learning has failed to distinguish between the two categories. We used a crowd-sourced hate speech lexicon to collect tweets containing hate speech keywords. We use crowd-sourcing to label a sample of these tweets into three categories: those containing hate speech, only offensive language, and those with neither. We train a multi-class classifier to distinguish between these different categories. Close analysis of the predictions and the errors shows when we can reliably separate hate speech from other offensive language and when this differentiation is more difficult. We find that racist and homophobic tweets are more likely to be classified as hate speech but that sexist tweets are generally classified as offensive. Tweets without explicit hate keywords are also more difficult to classify.\nQuestion: How long is their dataset?", "output": "85400000. Explanation: We extracted the time-line for each user, resulting in a set of 85.4 million tweets."}
{"input": "Pretrained transformer-based language models have achieved state of the art across countless tasks in natural language processing. These models are highly expressive, comprising at least a hundred million parameters and a dozen layers. Recent evidence suggests that only a few of the final layers need to be fine-tuned for high quality on downstream tasks. Naturally, a subsequent research question is, \"how many of the last layers do we need to fine-tune?\" In this paper, we precisely answer this question. We examine two recent pretrained language models, BERT and RoBERTa, across standard tasks in textual entailment, semantic similarity, sentiment analysis, and linguistic acceptability. We vary the number of final layers that are fine-tuned, then study the resulting change in task-specific effectiveness. We show that only a fourth of the final layers need to be fine-tuned to achieve 90% of the original quality. Surprisingly, we also find that fine-tuning all layers does not always help.\nQuestion: In what tasks does fine-tuning all layers hurt performance?", "output": "SST-2. Explanation: Finally, for the large variants of BERT and RoBERTa on SST-2 (second subfigure from both the top and the left), we observe a surprisingly consistent increase in quality when freezing 12\u201316 layers."}

{"input": "Social media, especially Twitter, is being increasingly used for research with predictive analytics. In social media studies, natural language processing (NLP) techniques are used in conjunction with expert-based, manual and qualitative analyses. However, social media data are unstructured and must undergo complex manipulation for research use. The manual annotation is the most resource and time-consuming process that multiple expert raters have to reach consensus on every item, but is essential to create gold-standard datasets for training NLP-based machine learning classifiers. To reduce the burden of the manual annotation, yet maintaining its reliability, we devised a crowdsourcing pipeline combined with active learning strategies. We demonstrated its effectiveness through a case study that identifies job loss events from individual tweets. We used Amazon Mechanical Turk platform to recruit annotators from the Internet and designed a number of quality control measures to assure annotation accuracy. We evaluated 4 different active learning strategies (i.e., least confident, entropy, vote entropy, and Kullback-Leibler divergence). The active learning strategies aim at reducing the number of tweets needed to reach a desired performance of automated classification. Results show that crowdsourcing is useful to create high-quality annotations and active learning helps in reducing the number of required tweets, although there was no substantial difference among the strategies tested.\nQuestion: Which was the most helpful strategy?", "output": "Vote entropy and KL divergence. Explanation: Vote entropy and KL divergence, the query-by-committee active learning methods are helpful for the training of machine learning ensemble classifiers. However, all the active learning strategies we tested do not work well with deep learning model (i.e., CNN) or deep learning-based ensemble classifier."}

In this paper, we argue that Chinese word embeddings can be substantially enriched by the morphological information hidden in characters which is reflected not only in strokes order sequentially, but also in character glyphs spatially. Then, we propose a novel Dual-channel Word Embedding (DWE) model to realize the joint learning of sequential and spatial information of characters.

{"input": "This paper proposes a machine learning approach to part-of-speech tagging and named entity recognition for Greek, focusing on the extraction of morphological features and classification of tokens into a small set of classes for named entities. The architecture model that was used is introduced. The greek version of the spaCy platform was added into the source code, a feature that did not exist before our contribution, and was used for building the models. Additionally, a part of speech tagger was trained that can detect the morphology of the tokens and performs higher than the state-of-the-art results when classifying only the part of speech. For named entity recognition using spaCy, a model that extends the standard ENAMEX type (organization, location, person) was built. Certain experiments that were conducted indicate the need for flexibility in out-of-vocabulary words and there is an effort for resolving this issue. Finally, the evaluation results are discussed.\nQuestion: What are the issues identified for out-of-vocabulary words?", "output": "model did not have a flexibility in OOV words. Explanation: Also, the model with the dataset vectors did not have the flexibility to classify unknown words.\n\nAs a next step, the test set of the dataset was altered by replacing words with syntactical mistakes to test the tolerance of the model in OOV words. Suffixes of verbs were altered and vowels were replaced with others, affecting 20% of the tokens of the dataset. Using again the more complex tagset for training, the results can be found in Table 3.\n\nWhat can be concluded is that the model did not have a flexibility in OOV words. Of course, this can also be an advantage, meaning that the model recognized the mismatch of a wrong word with its class.\n\nOne disadvantage that the previous model had is that for unknown words the model assigned a zero vector, affecting the testing results. In order to minimize this problem, the unknown words were first passed through a FastText model to get a vector from their subwords. The resulting vectors were imported in the vocabulary with the CC vectors before training. The model was also trained using as a vocabulary the unknown words and the tokens from the Common Crawl vectors, both buffered in the same FastText model. Results are listed in Table 4.\n\nIt was noticed that the model performed better when using the vectors from different FastText models."}

Explanation: In recent years, social media has evolved into an important source of information for various types of health-related research. Social networks encapsulate large volumes of data associated with diverse health topics, generated by active user bases in continuous growth. Twitter, for example, has 330 million monthly active users worldwide that generate almost 500 million micro-blogs (tweets) per day. For some years, the use of the platform to share personal health information has been growing, particularly amongst people living with one or more chronic conditions and those living with disability. Twenty percent of social network site users living with chronic conditions gather and share health information on the sites, compared with 12% of social network site users who report no chronic conditions. Social media data is thus being widely used for health-related research, for tasks such as adverse drug reaction detection BIBREF0, syndromic surveillance BIBREF1, subject recruitment for cancer trials BIBREF2, and characterizing drug abuse BIBREF3, to name a few. Twitter is particularly popular in research due to the availability of the public streaming API, which releases a sample of publicly posted data in real time. While early health-related research from social media focused almost exclusively on population-level studies, some very recent research tasks have focused on performing longitudinal data analysis at the user level, such as mining health-related information from cohorts of pregnant women BIBREF4."}

Therefore, in order to narrow down abstract sections that correspond to the P label, for example, we needed to find a subset of labels such as, but not limited to population, patients, and subjects.

{"input": "In this paper, we investigate a new approach to Population, Intervention and Outcome (PIO) element detection, a common task in Evidence Based Medicine (EBM). The purpose of this study is two-fold: to build a training dataset for PIO element detection with minimum redundancy and ambiguity and to investigate possible options in utilizing state of the art embedding methods for the task of PIO element detection. For the former purpose, we build a new and improved dataset by investigating the shortcomings of previously released datasets. For the latter purpose, we leverage the state of the art text embedding, Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), and build a multi-label classifier. We show that choosing a domain specific pre-trained embedding further optimizes the performance of the classifier. Furthermore, we show that the model could be enhanced by using ensemble methods and boosting techniques provided that features are adequately chosen.\nQuestion: what shortcomings of previous datasets are mentioned?", "output": "using a keyword-based approach would yield a sequence labeled population and methods with the label P, but such abstract sections were not purely about the population and contained information about the interventions and study design making them poor candidates for a P label.. Explanation: Since our goal was to collect sequences that are uniquely representative of a description of Population, Intervention, and Outcome, we avoided a keyword-based approach such as in BIBREF12 . For example, using a keyword-based approach would yield a sequence labeled population and methods with the label P, but such abstract sections were not purely about the population and contained information about the interventions and study design making them poor candidates for a P label."}
{"input": "Learning representations that accurately model semantics is an important goal of natural language processing research. Many semantic phenomena depend on syntactic structure. Recent work examines the extent to which state-of-the-art models for pre-training representations, such as BERT, capture such structure-dependent phenomena, but is largely restricted to one phenomenon in English: number agreement between subjects and verbs. We evaluate BERT's sensitivity to four types of structure-dependent agreement relations in a new semi-automatically curated dataset across 26 languages. We show that both the single-language and multilingual BERT models capture syntax-sensitive agreement patterns well in general, but we also highlight the specific linguistic contexts in which their performance degrades.\nQuestion: Do single-language BERT outperforms multilingual BERT?", "output": "For some language yes, but not for another.. Explanation: Figure FIGREF13 shows that BERT performed above 90% accuracy in each type. Performance is best on determiner and attributive agreement relations, while worst on subject-verb and predicate adjective.\n\nIn figure FIGREF14, we see BERT's performance for each language. BERT performs well for the majority of languages, although some fare much worse than others."}

{"input": "Modern text classification models are susceptible to adversarial examples, perturbed versions of the original text indiscernible by humans but which get misclassified by the model. We present BAE, a powerful black box attack for generating grammatically correct and semantically coherent adversarial examples. BAE replaces and inserts tokens in the original text by masking a portion of the text and leveraging a language model to generate alternatives for the masked tokens. Compared to prior work, we show that BAE performs a stronger attack on three widely used models for seven text classification datasets.\nQuestion: what text classification datasets do they evaluate on?", "output": "Amazon. Explanation: Datasets and Models We evaluate our adversarial attacks on different text classification datasets from tasks such as sentiment classification, subjectivity detection and question type classification. Amazon, Yelp, IMDB are sentence-level sentiment classification datasets which have been used in recent work BIBREF15 while MR BIBREF16 contains movie reviews based on sentiment polarity. MPQA BIBREF17 is a dataset for opinion polarity detection, Subj BIBREF18 for classifying a sentence as subjective or objective and TREC BIBREF19 is a dataset for question type classification."}

Tweets containing the latter six hashtags, corresponding to Ekman's six basic emotions BIBREF14 , were labeled as non-sarcastic. Those hashtags were chosen because their associated tweets were expected to still express opinions, similarly to sarcastic tweets, but in a non-sarcastic way. Tweets containing #sarcasm were labeled as sarcastic; annotating tweets with the #sarcasm hashtag as such is consistent with the vast majority of prior work in the Twitter domain BIBREF6 , BIBREF2 , BIBREF15 , BIBREF3 , BIBREF5 , BIBREF8 , BIBREF10 ."}

Explanation: Five models were trained: Two SVMs, one with linear kernel and the other with a radial basis function kernel (RBF), both with a value of 1 in the penalty parameter C of the error term. The gamma value of the RBF SVM which indicates how much influence a single training example has, was set to 2. The third classifier trained was another linear classifier with Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGDC) learning. The gradient of the loss is estimated each sample at a time and the SGDC is updated along the way with a decreasing learning rate. The parameters for maximum epochs and the stopping criterion were defined using the default values in scikit-learn. The final classifier was two models based on the Bayes theorem: Multinomial Na\u00efve Bayes, which works with occurrence counts, and Bernoulli Na\u00efve Bayes, which is designed for binary features."}

It assumes that there exist some natural language sentences in the application domain and uses this repository for the natural language description.

The second component is for sentence construction and relies on GF Library. The paper includes two use cases to demostrate the capability of the system. As the sentence construction is done via GF, the paper includes a use case evaluation showing that the proposed system could also be utilized in addressing a challenge to create an abstract Wikipedia, which is recently discussed in the BlueSky session of the 2018 International Semantic Web Conference.\nQuestion: How does sentence construction component works?", "output": "Given a paragraph, our system produces a GF program (a pair of an abstract and a concrete syntax), which can be used for sentence generation.

The system consists of two components, understanding sentences and generating GF grammar. The first component is divided into two sub-components, one for recognizing the sentence structure and one for recognizing the sentence components. The second component consists of a GF grammar encoder and a GF grammar exporter. The encoder is responsible for generating a GF grammar for each sentence, while the exporter aggregates the grammars generated from the encoder, and produces a comprehensive grammar for the whole paragraph."}

The manual annotation of narrative documents with medical terminology is a subtle and expensive task, since the number of reports is growing up day-by-day. MagiCoder, a Natural Language Processing algorithm, is proposed for the automatic encoding of free-text descriptions into MedDRA terms. MagiCoder procedure is efficient in terms of computational complexity (in particular, it is linear in the size of the narrative input and the terminology). We tested it on a large dataset of about 4500 manually revised reports, by performing an automated comparison between human and MagiCoder revisions. For the current base version of MagiCoder, we measured: on short descriptions, an average recall of $86\\%$ and an average precision of $88\\%$; on medium-long descriptions (up to 255 characters), an average recall of $64\\%$ and an average precision of $63\\%$. From a practical point of view, MagiCoder reduces the time required for encoding ADR reports. Pharmacologists have simply to review and validate the MagiCoder terms proposed by the application, instead of choosing the right terms among the 70K low level terms of MedDRA.

{"input": "Poetry generation is an interesting research topic in the field of text generation. As one of the most valuable literary and cultural heritages of China, Chinese classical poetry is very familiar and loved by Chinese people from generation to generation.

In this paper, we propose a GPT-2 based uniformed framework for generating major types of Chinese classical poems. We define a unified format for formulating all types of training samples by integrating detailed form information, then present a simple form-stressed weighting method in GPT-2 to strengthen the control to the form of the generated poems, with special emphasis on those forms with longer body length. Preliminary experimental results show this enhanced model can generate Chinese classical poems of major types with high quality in both form and content, validating the effectiveness of the proposed strategy.

Preliminary experimental results show this enhanced model can generate Chinese classical poems of major types with high quality in both form and content, validating the effectiveness of the proposed strategy. The model has been incorporated into Jiuge, the most influential Chinese classical poetry generation system developed by Tsinghua University (Guo et al., 2019).\nQuestion: What are the types of chinese poetry that are generated?", "output": "SHI. Explanation: Chinese Classical poetry can be classified into two primary categories, SHI and CI. According to the statistical data from CCPC1.0, a Chinese Classical Poetry Corpus consisting of 834,902 poems in total (We believe it is almost a full collection of Chinese Classical poems). 92.87% poems in CCPC1.0 fall into the category of SHI and 7.13% fall into the category of CI"}
{"input": "Neural machine translation (NMT) suffers a performance deficiency when a limited vocabulary fails to cover the source or target side adequately, which happens frequently when dealing with morphologically rich languages. To address this problem, previous work focused on adjusting translation granularity or expanding the vocabulary size. However, morphological information is relatively under-considered in NMT architectures, which may further improve translation quality. We propose a novel method, which can not only reduce data sparsity but also model morphology through a simple but effective mechanism. By predicting the stem and suffix separately during decoding, our system achieves an improvement of up to 1.98 BLEU compared with previous work on English to Russian translation. Our method is orthogonal to different NMT architectures and stably gains improvements on various domains.\nQuestion: what is the previous work they are comparing to?", "output": "RNN and Transformer baseline systems utilize BPE BIBREF3. Explanation: Our RNN and Transformer baseline systems utilize BPE BIBREF3 to transfer the original word sequence to subword sequence on both the source and the target sides, since the subword method had a stable improvement compared with word based system, especially on morphologically rich languages.\n\nBesides, we compared our system with a fully character-based baseline system, which is an implementation of BIBREF4 ( BIBREF4 )'s work, and is available on github."}
{"input": "Word2Vec is the most popular model for word representation and has been widely investigated in literature. However, its noise distribution for negative sampling is decided by empirical trials and the optimality has always been ignored. We suggest that the distribution is a sub-optimal choice, and propose to use a sub-sampled unigram distribution for better negative sampling. Our contributions include: (1) proposing the concept of semantics quantification and deriving a suitable sub-sampling rate for the proposed distribution adaptive to different training corpora; (2) demonstrating the advantages of our approach in both negative sampling and noise contrastive estimation by extensive evaluation tasks; and (3) proposing a semantics weighted model for the MSR sentence completion task, resulting in considerable improvements. Our work not only improves the quality of word vectors but also benefits current understanding of Word2Vec.\nQuestion: How is quality of the word vectors measured?", "output": "correlation between the word similarity scores by human judgment and the word distances in vector space. Explanation: Experiments ::: Task 1: Word Similarity Task ::: Task Description\nThe task computes the correlation between the word similarity scores by human judgment and the word distances in vector space.

An interpretable and controllable MODULAR algorithm separates these steps, using (1) a BERT-based classifier to identify problematic words and (2) a novel join embedding through which the classifier can edit the hidden states of the encoder. Large-scale human evaluation across four domains (encyclopedias, news headlines, books, and political speeches) suggests that these algorithms are a first step towards the automatic identification and reduction of bias.\nQuestion: How is subjective text automatically neutralized?", "output": "Identify subjective bias via the method of BIBREF2: using Wikipedia's neutral point of view (NPOV) policy and suggest edits that would make it more neutral.. Explanation: This work presents data and algorithms for automatically reducing bias in text. We focus on a particular kind of bias: inappropriate subjectivity (\u201csubjective bias\u201d). Subjective bias occurs when language that should be neutral and fair is skewed by feeling, opinion, or taste (whether consciously or unconsciously). In practice, we identify subjective bias via the method of BIBREF2: using Wikipedia's neutral point of view (NPOV) policy. This policy is a set of principles which includes \u201cavoiding stating opinions as facts\u201d and \u201cpreferring nonjudgemental language\u201d."}
{"input": "Voice-controlled personal and home assistants (such as the Amazon Echo and Apple Siri) are becoming increasingly popular for a variety of applications. However, the benefits of these technologies are not readily accessible to Deaf or Hard-ofHearing (DHH) users. The objective of this study is to develop and evaluate a sign recognition system using multiple modalities that can be used by DHH signers to interact with voice-controlled devices. With the advancement of depth sensors, skeletal data is used for applications like video analysis and activity recognition. Despite having similarity with the well-studied human activity recognition, the use of 3D skeleton data in sign language recognition is rare. This is because unlike activity recognition, sign language is mostly dependent on hand shape pattern. In this work, we investigate the feasibility of using skeletal and RGB video data for sign language recognition using a combination of different deep learning architectures. We validate our results on a large-scale American Sign Language (ASL) dataset of 12 users and 13107 samples across 51 signs. It is named as GMUASL51. 1 We collected the dataset over 6 months and it will be publicly released in the hope of spurring further machine learning research towards providing improved accessibility for digital assistants.\nQuestion: What is the sign language recognition task investigated?", "output": "We present a deep learning based approach for ASL recognition that leverages skeletal and video data. The proposed model captures the underlying temporal dynamics associated with sign language and also identifies specific hand shape patterns from video data to improve recognition performance.. Explanation: An automatic sign language recognizer enables an ASL user to translate the sign language to written text or speech, allowing them to communicate with people who are not familiar with ASL."}

{"input": "Countering online hate speech is a critical yet challenging task, but one which can be aided by the use of Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. Previous research has primarily focused on the development of NLP methods to automatically and effectively detect online hate speech while disregarding further action needed to calm and discourage individuals from using hate speech in the future. In addition, most existing hate speech datasets treat each post as an isolated instance, ignoring the conversational context. In this paper, we propose a novel task of generative hate speech intervention, where the goal is to automatically generate responses to intervene during online conversations that contain hate speech. As a part of this work, we introduce two fully-labeled large-scale hate speech intervention datasets collected from Gab and Reddit. These datasets provide conversation segments, hate speech labels, as well as intervention responses written by Mechanical Turk Workers. In this paper, we also analyze the datasets to understand the common intervention strategies and explore the performance of common automatic response generation methods on these new datasets to provide a benchmark for future research.\nQuestion: What models are used to generate responses?", "output": "Seq2Seq. Explanation: or generative hate speech intervention, we evaluated the following three methods.\n\nSeq2Seq BIBREF25, BIBREF24: The encoder consists of 2 bidirectional GRU layers. The decoder consists of 2 GRU layers followed by a 3-layer MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron).\n\nVariational Auto-Encoder (VAE) BIBREF26: The structure of the VAE model is similar to that of the Seq2Seq model, except that it has two independent linear layers followed by the encoder to calculate the mean and variance of the distribution of the latent variable separately. We assume the latent variable follows a multivariate Gaussian Distribution. KL annealing BIBREF27 is applied during training.\n\nReinforcement Learning (RL): We also implement the Reinforcement Learning method described in Section SECREF5. The backbone of this model is the Seq2Seq model, which follows the same Seq2Seq network structure described above. This network is used to parameterize the probability of a response given the conversation. Besides this backbone Seq2Seq model, another Seq2Seq model is used to generate the backward probability. This network is trained in a similar way as the backbone Seq2Seq model, but with a response as input and the corresponding conversation as the target."}

The proposed supervised ESC model also substantially outperformed the RNN-based Seq2seq and BIBREF11's baseline method. That is, our supervised model gave +2.0 improvements on R-1, R-2, and R-L scores over the RNN-based Seq2seq. This means that the proposed Transformer-based approaches can generate compressed sentences of high quality."}

Stage 1 performs phonetic embedding with speaker characteristics disentangled. Stage 2 then performs semantic embedding in addition.

This results in a mixture of a lead- INLINEFORM1 baseline and the centroid-based method.\n\nThe sentences are ranked separately in each document by their cosine similarity to the centroid vector, in decreasing order. The INLINEFORM0 best sentences of each document are selected as candidates.\n\nEach sentence is scored by the sum of the TF-IDF scores of the terms that are mentioned in that sentence for the first time in the document. The intuition is that sentences are preferred if they introduce new important information to a document."}

{"input": "Several approaches have recently been proposed for learning decentralized deep multiagent policies that coordinate via a differentiable communication channel. While these policies are effective for many tasks, interpretation of their induced communication strategies has remained a challenge. Here we propose to interpret agents' messages by translating them. Unlike in typical machine translation problems, we have no parallel data to learn from. Instead we develop a translation model based on the insight that agent messages and natural language strings mean the same thing if they induce the same belief about the world in a listener. We present theoretical guarantees and empirical evidence that our approach preserves both the semantics and pragmatics of messages by ensuring that players communicating through a translation layer do not suffer a substantial loss in reward relative to players with a common language.\nQuestion: What dataset is used?", "output": "the XKCD color dataset.

{"input": "Whereas conventional spoken language understanding (SLU) systems map speech to text, and then text to intent, end-to-end SLU systems map speech directly to intent through a single trainable model. Achieving high accuracy with these end-to-end models without a large amount of training data is difficult. We propose a method to reduce the data requirements of end-to-end SLU in which the model is first pre-trained to predict words and phonemes, thus learning good features for SLU. We introduce a new SLU dataset, Fluent Speech Commands, and show that our method improves performance both when the full dataset is used for training and when only a small subset is used. We also describe preliminary experiments to gauge the model's ability to generalize to new phrases not heard during training.\nQuestion: How was the dataset collected?", "output": "data was collected using crowdsourcing where speakers were recorded saying random ordered phrases for each intent twice.

Although there have been initial attempts, combining linguistic understanding with strategy effectively still remains a challenge. Towards this end, we aim to understand the role of natural language in negotiations from a data-driven perspective by attempting to predict a negotiation's outcome, well before the negotiation is complete. Building on the recent advancements in pre-trained language encoders, our model is able to predict correctly within 10% for more than 70% of the cases, by looking at just 60% of the negotiation. These results suggest that rather than just being a way to realize a negotiation, natural language should be incorporated in the negotiation planning as well. Such a framework can be directly used to get feedback for training an automatically negotiating agent.\nQuestion: what evaluation metrics were used?", "output": "Accuracy.

The dataset consists of 6682 dialogues between a buyer and a seller who converse in natural language to negotiate the price of a given product (sample in Table TABREF1). In total, 1402 product ad postings were scraped from Craigslist, belonging to six categories: phones, bikes, housing, furniture, car and electronics.

{"input": "In this report we present a system that can generate political speeches for a desired political party. Furthermore, the system allows to specify whether a speech should hold a supportive or opposing opinion. The system relies on a combination of several state-of-the-art NLP methods which are discussed in this report. These include n-grams, Justeson&Katz POS tag filter, recurrent neural networks, and latent Dirichlet allocation. Sequences of words are generated based on probabilities obtained from two underlying models: A language model takes care of the grammatical correctness while a topic model aims for textual consistency. Both models were trained on the Convote dataset which contains transcripts from US congressional floor debates. Furthermore, we present a manual and an automated approach to evaluate the quality of generated speeches. In an experimental evaluation generated speeches have shown very high quality in terms of grammatical correctness and sentence transitions.\nQuestion: how did they measure grammatical correctness?", "output": "Identify  POS tags for each sentence,  check whether one sentence from the corpus has the same sequence of POS tags. If the same POS sequence has been found, that points in a certain direction, if not found, the evaluation for that sentence is performed manually.. Explanation: For evaluating the grammatical correctness we identify for each sentence of the speech its POS tags. Then we check all sentences of the entire corpus whether one has the same sequence of POS tags. Having a sentence with the same POS tag structure does not necessarily mean that the grammar is correct. Neither does the lack of finding a matching sentence imply the existence of an error. But it points in a certain direction. Furthermore, we let the system output the sentence for which it could not find a matching sentence so that we can evaluate those sentences manually."}

The result shows that it is possible to learn Audio Word2Vec model from high-resource languages and use it on low-resource languages. This further expands the usability of Audio Word2Vec.\nQuestion: Which pairs of languages do they consider similar enough to capture phonetic structure?", "output": "German and French. Explanation: English, German and French are more similar compared with Czech and Spanish."}
{"input": "One of the principal tasks of machine learning with major applications is text classification. This paper focuses on the legal domain and, in particular, on the classification of lengthy legal documents. The main challenge that this study addresses is the limitation that current models impose on the length of the input text. In addition, the present paper shows that dividing the text into segments and later combining the resulting embeddings with a BiLSTM architecture to form a single document embedding can improve results. These advancements are achieved by utilising a simpler structure, rather than an increasingly complex one, which is often the case in NLP research. The dataset used in this paper is obtained from an online public database containing lengthy legal documents with highly domain-specific vocabulary and thus, the comparison of our results to the ones produced by models implemented on the commonly used datasets would be unjustified. This work provides the foundation for future work in document classification in the legal field.\nQuestion: What are their results on this task?", "output": "98.11% accuracy with a 0.4% improvement upon the benchmark model.

We explored a model for sentiment classification that takes the embeddings of the radicals of the Chinese characters, i.e, hanzi of Chinese and kanji of Japanese. Our model is composed of a CNN word feature encoder and a bi-directional RNN document feature encoder. The results achieved are on par with the character embedding-based models, and close to the state-of-the-art word embedding-based models, with 90% smaller vocabulary, and at least 13% and 80% fewer parameters than the character embedding-based models and word embedding-based models respectively. The results suggest that the radical embedding-based approach is cost-effective for machine learning on Chinese and Japanese.\nQuestion: what are the state of the art models?", "output": "The character-aware neural language model BIBREF1.

{"input": "Previous work on neural noisy channel modeling relied on latent variable models that incrementally process the source and target sentence. This makes decoding decisions based on partial source prefixes even though the full source is available. We pursue an alternative approach based on standard sequence to sequence models which utilize the entire source. These models perform remarkably well as channel models, even though they have neither been trained on, nor designed to factor over incomplete target sentences. Experiments with neural language models trained on billions of words show that noisy channel models can outperform a direct model by up to 3.2 BLEU on WMT'17 German-English translation. We evaluate on four language-pairs and our channel models consistently outperform strong alternatives such right-to-left reranking models and ensembles of direct models.\nQuestion: Which language pairs do they evaluate on?", "output": "English-German.

{"input": "Direct computer vision based-nutrient content estimation is a demanding task, due to deformation and occlusions of ingredients, as well as high intra-class and low inter-class variability between meal classes. In order to tackle these issues, we propose a system for recipe retrieval from images. The recipe information can subsequently be used to estimate the nutrient content of the meal. In this study, we utilize the multi-modal Recipe1M dataset, which contains over 1 million recipes accompanied by over 13 million images. The proposed model can operate as a first step in an automatic pipeline for the estimation of nutrition content by supporting hints related to ingredient and instruction. Through self-attention, our model can directly process raw recipe text, making the upstream instruction sentence embedding process redundant and thus reducing training time, while providing desirable retrieval results. Furthermore, we propose the use of an ingredient attention mechanism, in order to gain insight into which instructions, parts of instructions or single instruction words are of importance for processing a single ingredient within a certain recipe. Attention-based recipe text encoding contributes to solving the issue of high intra-class/low inter-class variability by focusing on preparation steps specific to the meal.

Explanation: In this paper, we integrate context information into word-by-word translation by combining a language model (LM) with cross-lingual word embedding. Let $f$ be a source word in the current position and $e$ a possible target word. Given a history $h$ of target words before $e$ , the score of $e$ to be the translation of $f$ would be:\n\n$ L(e;f,h) = \\lambda _\\text{emb}\\log q(f,e) + \\lambda _\\text{LM}\\log p(e|h) $\n\nHere, $q(f,e)$ is a lexical score defined as:\n\n$ q(f,e) = \\frac{d(f,e) + 1}{2} $\n\nwhere $d(f,e) \\in [-1,1]$ is a cosine similarity between $f$ and $e$ . It is transformed to the range $[0,1]$ to make it similar in scale with the LM probability. In our experiments, we found that this simple linear scaling is better than sigmoid or softmax functions in the final translation performance."}
{"input": "Implicit discourse relation recognition is a crucial component for automatic discourselevel analysis and nature language understanding. Previous studies exploit discriminative models that are built on either powerful manual features or deep discourse representations. In this paper, instead, we explore generative models and propose a variational neural discourse relation recognizer. We refer to this model as VarNDRR. VarNDRR establishes a directed probabilistic model with a latent continuous variable that generates both a discourse and the relation between the two arguments of the discourse. In order to perform efficient inference and learning, we introduce neural discourse relation models to approximate the prior and posterior distributions of the latent variable, and employ these approximated distributions to optimize a reparameterized variational lower bound. This allows VarNDRR to be trained with standard stochastic gradient methods. Experiments on the benchmark data set show that VarNDRR can achieve comparable results against stateof- the-art baselines without using any manual features.\nQuestion: What datasets are used?", "output": "PDTB 2.0.

The detailed analyses of the dataset show that existing spelling correctors merely achieve an F-measure of approx. 0.5, suggesting that the dataset serves as a new, rich source of spelling errors that complement existing datasets.\nQuestion: How did they identify what language the text was?", "output": "used NanigoNet, a language detector based on GCNNs (Gated Convolutional Neural Networks) BIBREF17 that supports human languages as well as programming languages. Explanation: Due to its nature, repositories on GitHub contain a large amount of code (in programming language) as well as natural language texts. We used NanigoNet, a language detector based on GCNNs (Gated Convolutional Neural Networks) BIBREF17 that supports human languages as well as programming languages. Specifically, we ran the language detector against both the source and the target and discarded all the edits where either is determined as written in a non-human language."}

{"input": "We present a systematic investigation of layer-wise BERT activations for general-purpose text representations to understand what linguistic information they capture and how transferable they are across different tasks. Sentence-level embeddings are evaluated against two state-of-the-art models on downstream and probing tasks from SentEval, while passage-level embeddings are evaluated on four question-answering (QA) datasets under a learning-to-rank problem setting. Embeddings from the pre-trained BERT model perform poorly in semantic similarity and sentence surface information probing tasks. Fine-tuning BERT on natural language inference data greatly improves the quality of the embeddings. Combining embeddings from different BERT layers can further boost performance. BERT embeddings outperform BM25 baseline significantly on factoid QA datasets at the passage level, but fail to perform better than BM25 on non-factoid datasets. For all QA datasets, there is a gap between embedding-based method and in-domain fine-tuned BERT (we report new state-of-the-art results on two datasets), which suggests deep interactions between question and answer pairs are critical for those hard tasks.\nQuestion: Which BERT layers were combined to boost performance?", "output": "Top and bottom layers.

{"input": "Corpora and web texts can become a rich language learning resource if we have a means of assessing whether they are linguistically appropriate for learners at a given proficiency level. In this paper, we aim at addressing this issue by presenting the first approach for predicting linguistic complexity for Swedish second language learning material on a 5-point scale. After showing that the traditional Swedish readability measure, L\\\"asbarhetsindex (LIX), is not suitable for this task, we propose a supervised machine learning model, based on a range of linguistic features, that can reliably classify texts according to their difficulty level. Our model obtained an accuracy of 81.3% and an F-score of 0.8, which is comparable to the state of the art in English and is considerably higher than previously reported results for other languages. We further studied the utility of our features with single sentences instead of full texts since sentences are a common linguistic unit in language learning exercises. We trained a separate model on sentence-level data with five classes, which yielded 63.4% accuracy. Although this is lower than the document level performance, we achieved an adjacent accuracy of 92%. Furthermore, we found that using a combination of different features, compared to using lexical features alone, resulted in 7% improvement in classification accuracy at the sentence level, whereas at the document level, lexical features were more dominant. Our models are intended for use in a freely accessible web-based language learning platform for the automatic generation of exercises.\nQuestion: what classifiers did they train?", "output": "a multinomial logistic regression model with ridge estimator.

{"input": "The online new emerging suspicious users, that usually are called trolls, are one of the main sources of hate, fake, and deceptive online messages. Some agendas are utilizing these harmful users to spread incitement tweets, and as a consequence, the audience get deceived. The challenge in detecting such accounts is that they conceal their identities which make them disguised in social media, adding more difficulty to identify them using just their social network information. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a text-based approach to detect the online trolls such as those that were discovered during the US 2016 presidential elections. Our approach is mainly based on textual features which utilize thematic information, and profiling features to identify the accounts from their way of writing tweets. We deduced the thematic information in a unsupervised way and we show that coupling them with the textual features enhanced the performance of the proposed model. In addition, we find that the proposed profiling features perform the best comparing to the textual features.\nQuestion: What type of model were the features used in?", "output": "character-based Bidirectional Gated Recurrent neural network. Explanation: In order to evaluate our feature set, we use Random Selection, Majority Class, and bag-of-words baselines. In the bag-of-words baseline, we aggregate all the tweets of a user into one document. A previous work BIBREF30 showed that IRA trolls were playing a hashtag game which is a popular word game played on Twitter, where users add a hashtag to their tweets and then answer an implied question BIBREF31. IRA trolls used this game in a similar way but focusing more on offending or attacking others; an example from IRA tweets: \"#OffendEveryoneIn4Words undocumented immigrants are ILLEGALS\". Thus, we use as a baseline Tweet2vec BIBREF32 which is a a character-based Bidirectional Gated Recurrent neural network reads tweets and predicts their hashtags. We aim to assess if the tweets hashtags can help identifying the IRA tweets. The model reads the tweets in a form of character one-hot encodings and uses them for training with their hashtags as labels. To train the model, we use our collected dataset which consists of $\\sim $3.7M tweets. To represent the tweets in this baseline, we use the decoded embedding produced by the model and we feed them to the Logistic Regression classifier."}

{"input": "This paper fills a gap in aspect-based sentiment analysis and aims to present a new method for preparing and analysing texts concerning opinion and generating user-friendly descriptive reports in natural language. We present a comprehensive set of techniques derived from Rhetorical Structure Theory and sentiment analysis to extract aspects from textual opinions and then build an abstractive summary of a set of opinions. Moreover, we propose aspect-aspect graphs to evaluate the importance of aspects and to filter out unimportant ones from the summary. Additionally, the paper presents a prototype solution of data flow with interesting and valuable results. The proposed method's results proved the high accuracy of aspect detection when applied to the gold standard dataset.\nQuestion: what dataset was used?", "output": "SNAP Amazon Dataset.

{"input": "With the growing interest in social applications of Natural Language Processing and Computational Argumentation, a natural question is how controversial a given concept is. Prior works relied on Wikipedia's metadata and on content analysis of the articles pertaining to a concept in question.

{"input": "What is an effective expression that draws laughter from human beings? In the present paper, in order to consider this question from an academic standpoint, we generate an image caption that draws a\"laugh\"by a computer. A system that outputs funny captions based on the image caption proposed in the computer vision field is constructed. Moreover, we also propose the Funny Score, which flexibly gives weights according to an evaluation database. The Funny Score more effectively brings out\"laughter\"to optimize a model. In addition, we build a self-collected BoketeDB, which contains a theme (image) and funny caption (text) posted on\"Bokete\", which is an image Ogiri website. In an experiment, we use BoketeDB to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method by comparing the results obtained using the proposed method and those obtained using MS COCO Pre-trained CNN+LSTM, which is the baseline and idiot created by humans. We refer to the proposed method, which uses the BoketeDB pre-trained model, as the Neural Joking Machine (NJM).\nQuestion: What is the performance of NJM?", "output": "NJM vas selected as the funniest caption among the three options 22.59% of the times, and NJM captions posted to Bokete averaged 3.23 stars. Explanation: In this subsection, we present the experimental results along with a discussion. Table TABREF10 shows the experimental results of the questionnaire. A total of 16 personal questionnaires were completed. Table TABREF10 shows the percentages of captions of each rank for each method of caption generation considered herein. Captions generated by humans were ranked \u201cfunniest\u201d 67.99% of the time, followed by the NJM at 22.59%. The baseline captions, STAIR caption, were ranked \u201cfunniest\u201d 9.41% of the time. These results suggest that captions generated by the NJM are less funny than those generated by humans. However, the NJM is ranked much higher than STAIR caption."}

Explanation: The Bokete Ogiri website uses the number of stars to evaluate the degree of funniness of a caption. The user evaluates the \u201cfunniness\u201d of a posted caption and assigns one to three stars to the caption. Therefore, funnier captions tend to be assigned a lot of stars. We focus on the number of stars in order to propose an effective training method, in which the Funny Score enables us to evaluate the funniness of a caption. Based on the results of our pre-experiment, a Funny Score of 100 stars is treated as a threshold. In other words, the Funny Score outputs a loss value INLINEFORM0 when #star is less than 100. In contrast, the Funny Score returns INLINEFORM1 when #star is over 100. The loss value INLINEFORM2 is calculated with the LSTM as an average of each mini-batch."}
{"input": "Speech-based natural language question-answering interfaces to enterprise systems are gaining a lot of attention. General-purpose speech engines can be integrated with NLP systems to provide such interfaces. Usually, general-purpose speech engines are trained on large `general' corpus. However, when such engines are used for specific domains, they may not recognize domain-specific words well, and may produce erroneous output. Further, the accent and the environmental conditions in which the speaker speaks a sentence may induce the speech engine to inaccurately recognize certain words. The subsequent natural language question-answering does not produce the requisite results as the question does not accurately represent what the speaker intended. Thus, the speech engine's output may need to be adapted for a domain before further natural language processing is carried out. We present two mechanisms for such an adaptation, one based on evolutionary development and the other based on machine learning, and show how we can repair the speech-output to make the subsequent natural language question-answering better.\nQuestion: Which dataset do they use?", "output": "Annual Retail Trade Survey of U.S. Retail and Food Services Firms for the period of 1992 to 2013.

{"input": "Unsupervised subword modeling aims to learn low-level representations of speech audio in\"zero-resource\"settings: that is, without using transcriptions or other resources from the target language (such as text corpora or pronunciation dictionaries). A good representation should capture phonetic content and abstract away from other types of variability, such as speaker differences and channel noise. Previous work in this area has primarily focused on learning from target language data only, and has been evaluated only intrinsically. Here we directly compare multiple methods, including some that use only target language speech data and some that use transcribed speech from other (non-target) languages, and we evaluate using two intrinsic measures as well as on a downstream unsupervised word segmentation and clustering task. We find that combining two existing target-language-only methods yields better features than either method alone. Nevertheless, even better results are obtained by extracting target language bottleneck features using a model trained on other languages. Cross-lingual training using just one other language is enough to provide this benefit, but multilingual training helps even more. In addition to these results, which hold across both intrinsic measures and the extrinsic task, we discuss the qualitative differences between the different types of learned features.\nQuestion: With how many languages do they experiment in the multilingual setup?", "output": "ten languages.

{"input": "Recent researches prevalently used BiLSTM-CNN as a core module for NER in a sequence-labeling setup. This paper formally shows the limitation of BiLSTM-CNN encoders in modeling cross-context patterns for each word, i.e., patterns crossing past and future for a specific time step. Two types of cross-structures are used to remedy the problem: A BiLSTM variant with cross-link between layers; a multi-head self-attention mechanism. These cross-structures bring consistent improvements across a wide range of NER domains for a core system using BiLSTM-CNN without additional gazetteers, POS taggers, language-modeling, or multi-task supervision.

{"input": "Recent researches prevalently used BiLSTM-CNN as a core module for NER in a sequence-labeling setup. This paper formally shows the limitation of BiLSTM-CNN encoders in modeling cross-context patterns for each word, i.e., patterns crossing past and future for a specific time step. Two types of cross-structures are used to remedy the problem: A BiLSTM variant with cross-link between layers; a multi-head self-attention mechanism. These cross-structures bring consistent improvements across a wide range of NER domains for a core system using BiLSTM-CNN without additional gazetteers, POS taggers, language-modeling, or multi-task supervision.

Mapping all of these forms to a single NE requires a complex understanding of the variations, some of which are genre-specific. Confusability is defined by examples when it becomes more difficult to disambiguate named entities that share the same surface form, such as the \"language\" versus \"NORP\" distinction represented by the surface forms Dutch and English.. Explanation: For example, work-of-art/creative-work entities could in principle take any surface forms \u2013 unseen, the same as a person name, abbreviated, or written with unreliable capitalizations on social media."}

At the beginning, word level and character level n-gram features are obtained and concatenated. Then they are normalized with tf-idf transformation. For reducing the number of features and sparsity in n-gram vectors, tuples that have frequency less than 2 are ignored. For character level n-gram $N$ is selected as $3,4$, and 5 and for word level n-gram, $N$ is $1,2$ for Spanish and Arabic; $1,2,3$ for English. The dimension of the vector is reduced by LSA to 300. Then the vector is concatenated with neural representation which is produced right after tweet level attention in RNNwA model.

{"input": "We propose a two-layer cache mechanism to speed up dynamic WFST decoding with personalized language models. The first layer is a public cache that stores most of the static part of the graph. This is shared globally among all users. A second layer is a private cache that caches the graph that represents the personalized language model, which is only shared by the utterances from a particular user. We also propose two simple yet effective pre-initialization methods, one based on breadth-first search, and another based on a data-driven exploration of decoder states using previous utterances. Experiments with a calling speech recognition task using a personalized contact list demonstrate that the proposed public cache reduces decoding time by factor of three compared to decoding without pre-initialization. Using the private cache provides additional efficiency gains, reducing the decoding time by a factor of five.\nQuestion: What does the cache consist of?", "output": "static public cache stores the most frequent states. Explanation: In order to support this mechanism, we use a two-layered cached FST for decoding. The first layer is public cache which represents $T_P$.

{"input": "The rapid growth of social media in recent years has fed into some highly undesirable phenomena such as proliferation of abusive and offensive language on the Internet. Previous research suggests that such hateful content tends to come from users who share a set of common stereotypes and form communities around them. The current state-of-the-art approaches to hate speech detection are oblivious to user and community information and rely entirely on textual (i.e., lexical and semantic) cues. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to this problem that incorporates community-based profiling features of Twitter users. Experimenting with a dataset of 16k tweets, we show that our methods significantly outperform the current state of the art in hate speech detection. Further, we conduct a qualitative analysis of model characteristics. We release our code, pre-trained models and all the resources used in the public domain.\nQuestion: Is the dataset used in other work?", "output": "Yes, in Waseem and Hovy (2016). Explanation: We experiment with the dataset of Waseem and Hovy c53cecce142c48628b3883d13155261c, containing tweets manually annotated for hate speech. The authors retrieved around $136k$ tweets over a period of two months. They bootstrapped their collection process with a search for commonly used slurs and expletives related to religious, sexual, gender and ethnic minorities. From the results, they identified terms and references to entities that frequently showed up in hateful tweets. Based on this sample, they used a public Twitter api to collect the entire corpus of ca. $136k$ tweets. After having manually annotated a randomly sampled subset of $16,914$ tweets under the categories racism, sexism or none themselves, they asked an expert to review their annotations in order to mitigate against any biases."}

Explanation: Table 3 shows examples of hateful tweets from the dataset that are misclassified by the lr method, but are correctly classified upon the addition of author profiling features, i.e., by the lr + auth method. It is worth noting that some of the wins scored by the latter are on tweets that are part of a larger hateful discourse or contain links to hateful content while not explicitly having textual cues that are indicative of hate speech per se. The addition of author profiling features may then be viewed as a proxy for wider discourse information, thus allowing us to correctly resolve the cases where lexical and semantic features alone are insufficient."}

{"input": "Research in social media analysis is experiencing a recent surge with a large number of works applying representation learning models to solve high-level syntactico-semantic tasks such as sentiment analysis, semantic textual similarity computation, hashtag prediction and so on. Although the performance of the representation learning models are better than the traditional baselines for the tasks, little is known about the core properties of a tweet encoded within the representations. Understanding these core properties would empower us in making generalizable conclusions about the quality of representations. Our work presented here constitutes the first step in opening the black-box of vector embedding for social media posts, with emphasis on tweets in particular. In order to understand the core properties encoded in a tweet representation, we evaluate the representations to estimate the extent to which it can model each of those properties such as tweet length, presence of words, hashtags, mentions, capitalization, and so on. This is done with the help of multiple classifiers which take the representation as input. Essentially, each classifier evaluates one of the syntactic or social properties which are arguably salient for a tweet. This is also the first holistic study on extensively analysing the ability to encode these properties for a wide variety of tweet representation models including the traditional unsupervised methods (BOW, LDA), unsupervised representation learning methods (Siamese CBOW, Tweet2Vec) as well as supervised methods (CNN, BLSTM).\nQuestion: What conclusions do the authors draw from their experiments?", "output": "among supervised models, CNN, LSTM and BLSTM encapsulates most of the syntactic and social properties with a great accuracy, while BOW, DSSM, STV and T2V does that among the unsupervised models. Explanation: We observed that among supervised models, CNN, LSTM and BLSTM encapsulates most of the syntactic and social properties with a great accuracy, while BOW, DSSM, STV and T2V does that among the unsupervised models. Tweet length affects the task prediction accuracies, but we found that all models behave similarly under variation in tweet length. Finally while LDA is insensitive to input word order, CNN, LSTM and BLSTM are extremely sensitive to word order."}

Explanation: We assume that if we cannot train a classifier to predict a property based on its tweet representation, then this property is not encoded in this representation. For example, the model which preserves the tweet length should perform well in predicting the length given the representation generated from the model. Though these elementary property prediction tasks are not directly related to any downstream application, knowing that the model is good at modeling a particular property (e.g., the social properties) indicates that it could excel in correlated applications (e.g., user profiling task)."}

Our model represents the first attempt to integrating a large commonsense knowledge base into end-to-end conversational models. In the retrieval-based scenario, we propose the Tri-LSTM model to jointly take into account message and commonsense for selecting an appropriate response. Our experiments suggest that the knowledge-augmented models are superior to their knowledge-free counterparts in automatic evaluation.\nQuestion: Which domain are the conversations in?", "output": "open-domain. Explanation: Our work distinguishes itself from previous research in that we consider a large heterogeneous commonsense knowledge base in an open-domain retrieval-based dialogue setting."}

{"input": "Today, recommender systems are an inevitable part of everyone's daily digital routine and are present on most internet platforms. State-of-the-art deep learning-based models require a large number of data to achieve their best performance. Many datasets fulfilling this criterion have been proposed for multiple domains, such as Amazon products, restaurants, or beers. However, works and datasets in the hotel domain are limited: the largest hotel review dataset is below the million samples. Additionally, the hotel domain suffers from a higher data sparsity than traditional recommendation datasets and therefore, traditional collaborative-filtering approaches cannot be applied to such data. In this paper, we propose HotelRec, a very large-scale hotel recommendation dataset, based on TripAdvisor, containing 50 million reviews. To the best of our knowledge, HotelRec is the largest publicly available dataset in the hotel domain (50M versus 0.9M) and additionally, the largest recommendation dataset in a single domain and with textual reviews (50M versus 22M). We release HotelRec for further research: this https URL.\nQuestion: How did they obtain the dataset?", "output": "The authors crawled all areas listed an TripAdvisor's SiteIndex and gathered all links related to hotels. Using Selenium, they put a time gap between opening each page, to mimic human behaviour and avoid having their scraper being detected. They discarded pages without a review and for pages with a review, they collected the review's profile, the overall rating, the summary, the written text and subratings, where given.. Explanation: We first crawled all areas listed on TripAdvisor's SiteIndex. Each area link leads to another page containing different information, such as a list of accommodations, or restaurants; we gathered all links corresponding to hotels. Our robot then opened each of the hotel links and filtered out hotels without any review. In total, in July 2019, there were $365\\,056$ out of $2\\,502\\,140$ hotels with at least one review."}

{"input": "Knowledge Graph Embedding methods aim at representing entities and relations in a knowledge base as points or vectors in a continuous vector space. Several approaches using embeddings have shown promising results on tasks such as link prediction, entity recommendation, question answering, and triplet classification. However, only a few methods can compute low-dimensional embeddings of very large knowledge bases without needing state-of-the-art computational resources. In this paper, we propose KG2Vec, a simple and fast approach to Knowledge Graph Embedding based on the skip-gram model. Instead of using a predefined scoring function, we learn it relying on Long Short-Term Memories. We show that our embeddings achieve results comparable with the most scalable approaches on knowledge graph completion as well as on a new metric. Yet, KG2Vec can embed large graphs in lesser time by processing more than 250 million triples in less than 7 hours on common hardware.\nQuestion: What is the new metric?", "output": "They propose two new metrics. One, which they call the Neighbour Similarity Test, calculates how many shared characteristics there are between entities whose representations are neighbors in the embedding space. The second, which they call the Type and Category Test, is the same as the  Neighbour Similarity Test, except it uses entity types and categories in the place of individual entity characteristics.. Explanation: In this paper, we introduce two metrics inspired by The Identity of Indiscernibles BIBREF24 to gain insights over the distributional quality of the learned embeddings. The more characteristics two entities share, the more similar they are and so should be their vector representations. Considering the set of characteristics $C_K(s)=\\lbrace (p_1,o_1),\\dots ,(p_m,o_m)\\rbrace $ of a subject $s$ in a triple, we can define a metric that expresses the similarity among two entities $e_1,e_2$ as the Jaccard index between their sets of characteristics $C_K(e_1)$ and $C_K(e_2)$ . Given a set of entities $\\tilde{E}$ and their $N$ nearest neighbours in the vector space, the overall Neighbour Similarity Test (NST) metric is defined as:\n\n$$ NST(\\tilde{E},N,K) = \\frac{1}{N \\vert \\tilde{E} \\vert } \\sum _{e \\in \\tilde{E}} \\sum _{j=1}^N \\frac{\\vert C_K(e) \\cap C_K(n_j^{(e)}) \\vert }{\\vert C_K(e) \\cup C_K(n_j^{(e)}) \\vert }$$ (Eq. 19)\n\nwhere $n_j^{(e)}$ is the $j$ th nearest neighbour of $e$ in the vector space.\n\nThe second metric is the Type and Category Test (TCT), based on the assumption that two entities which share types and categories should be close in the vector space. This assumption is suggested by the human bias for which rdf:type and dct:subject would be predicates with a higher weight than the others. Although this does not happen, we compute it for a mere sake of comparison with the NST metric. The TCT formula is equal to Equation 19 except for sets $C_K(e)$ , which are replaced by sets of types and categories $TC_K(e)$ ."}

Along the way we discuss various challenges that the field faces, lack of context in utterances, not having a good quantitative metric to compare models, lack of trust in agents because they do not have a consistent persona etc. We structure this paper in a way that answers these pertinent questions and discusses competing approaches to solve them.\nQuestion: What are the limitations of the currently used quantitative metrics? e.g. why are they not 'good'?", "output": "perplexity and BLEU score are not good enough and correlate very weakly with human judgments. Explanation: The current evaluation methods like perplexity and BLEU score are not good enough and correlate very weakly with human judgments."}

Explanation: Sequence to Sequence approaches for dialogue modelling\nThe problem with rule-based models was that they were often domain dependent and could not be easily ported to a new domain. They also depended on hand crafted rules which was both expensive and required domain expertise. Two factors which when combined spell doom for scalbility. All of this changed in 2015 when Vinyals et al proposed an approach BIBREF2 inspired from the recent progress in machine translation BIBREF1 . Vinyals et al used the sequence to sequence learning architecture for conversation agents. Their model was the first model which could be trained end-to-end, and could generate a new output utterance based on just the input sentence and no other hand crafted features."}

{"input": "We are exploring the historical significance of research in the field of machine translation conducted by Bulcsu Laszlo, Croatian linguist, who was a pioneer in machine translation in Yugoslavia during the 1950s.

Explanation: The first task is to compile a dictionary of words sorted from the end of the word to the beginning. This would enable the development of what is now called stemming and lemmatization modules: a knowledge base with suffixes so they can be trimmed, but also a systematic way to find the base of the word (lemmatization) (p. 121). The second task would be to make a word frequency table. This would enable focusing on a few thousand most frequent words and dropping the rest. This is currently a good industrial practice for building efficient natural language processing systems, and in 1962, it was a computational necessity. The last task was to create a good thesaurus, but such a thesaurus where every data point has a \"meaning\" as the key, and words (synonyms) as values."}

Explanation: In the USSR, there were four major approaches to machine translation in the late 1950s BIBREF7. The first one was the research at the Institute for Precise Mechanics and Computational Technology of the USSR Academy of Sciences. Their approach was mostly experimental and not much different from today's empirical methods. They evaluated the majority of algorithms known at the time algorithms over meticulously prepared datasets, whose main strength was data cleaning, and by 1959 they have built a German-Russian machine translation prototype. The second approach, as noted by Muli\u0107 BIBREF7, was championed by the team at the Steklov Mathematical Institute of the USSR Academy of Sciences led by A. A. Reformatsky. Their approach was mainly logical, and they extended the theoretical ideas of Bar-Hillel BIBREF2 to build three algorithms: French-Russian, English-Russian and Hungarian-Russian. The third and perhaps the most successful approach was the one by A. A. Lyapunov, O. S. Kulagina and R. L. Dobrushin. Their efforts resulted in the formation of the Mathematical Linguistics Seminar at the Faculty of Philology in Moscow in 1956 and in Leningrad in 1957. Their approach was mainly information-theoretic (but they also tried logic-based approaches BIBREF7), which was considered cybernetic at that time. This was the main role model for the Croatian efforts from 1957 onwards. The fourth, and perhaps most influential, was the approach at the Experimental Laboratory of the Leningrad University championed by N. D. Andreev BIBREF7. Here, the algorithms for Indonesian-Russian, Arabic-Russian, Hindu-Russian, Japanese-Russian, Burmese-Russian, Norwegian-Russian, English-Russian, Spanish-Russian and Turkish-Russian were being built. The main approach of Andreev's group was to use an intermediary language, which would capture the meanings BIBREF7. It was an approach similar to KL-ONE, which would be introduced in the West much later (in 1985) by Brachman and Schmolze BIBREF8. It is also interesting to note that the Andreev group had a profound influence on the Czechoslovakian machine translation program BIBREF9, which unfortunately suffered a similar fate as the Yugoslav one due to the lack of funding."}

{"input": "Emotion cause extraction aims to identify the reasons behind a certain emotion expressed in text. It is a much more difficult task compared to emotion classification. Inspired by recent advances in using deep memory networks for question answering (QA), we propose a new approach which considers emotion cause identification as a reading comprehension task in QA. Inspired by convolutional neural networks, we propose a new mechanism to store relevant context in different memory slots to model context information. Our proposed approach can extract both word level sequence features and lexical features.

Successful prevention depends on the adequate detection of potentially harmful messages and the information overload on the Web requires intelligent systems to identify potential risks automatically. The focus of this paper is on automatic cyberbullying detection in social media text by modelling posts written by bullies, victims, and bystanders of online bullying. We describe the collection and fine-grained annotation of a training corpus for English and Dutch and perform a series of binary classification experiments to determine the feasibility of automatic cyberbullying detection.

{"input": "The Internet and, in particular, Online Social Networks have changed the way that terrorist and extremist groups can influence and radicalise individuals. Recent reports show that the mode of operation of these groups starts by exposing a wide audience to extremist material online, before migrating them to less open online platforms for further radicalization. Thus, identifying radical content online is crucial to limit the reach and spread of the extremist narrative. In this paper, our aim is to identify measures to automatically detect radical content in social media. We identify several signals, including textual, psychological and behavioural, that together allow for the classification of radical messages. Our contribution is three-fold: (1) we analyze propaganda material published by extremist groups and create a contextual text-based model of radical content, (2) we build a model of psychological properties inferred from these material, and (3) we evaluate these models on Twitter to determine the extent to which it is possible to automatically identify online radical tweets. Our results show that radical users do exhibit distinguishable textual, psychological, and behavioural properties. We find that the psychological properties are among the most distinguishing features. Additionally, our results show that textual models using vector embedding features significantly improves the detection over TF-IDF features. We validate our approach on two experiments achieving high accuracy.

Explanation: We investigated which features contribute most to the classification task to distinguish between radical and non-radical tweets. We used the mean decrease impurity method of random forests BIBREF27 to identify the most important features in each feature category. The ten most important features are shown in Table TABREF22 . We found that the most important feature for distinguishing radical tweets is the psychological feature distance measure. This measures how similar the Twitter user is to the average psychological profile calculated from the propaganda magazine articles. Following this is the Us-them dichotomy which looks at the total number of pronouns used (I,they, we, you). This finding is in line with the tactics reported in the radicalization literature with regards to emphasizing the separation between the radical group and the world."}

The graph INLINEFORM5 is a directed graph, where an edge INLINEFORM6 exists between two user nodes INLINEFORM7 and INLINEFORM8 , if user INLINEFORM9 mentions user INLINEFORM10 .

Explanation: We utilise LIWC dictionaries to assign a score to a set of psychological, personality, and emotional categories. Mainly, we look at the following properties: (1) Summary variables: Analytically thinking which reflects formal, logical, and hierarchical thinking (high value), versus informal, personal, and narrative thinking (low value). Clout which reflects high expertise and confidence levels (high value), versus tentative, humble, and anxious levels (low value). Tone which reflects positive emotions (high value) versus more negative emotions such as anxiety, sadness, or anger (low value). Authentic which reflects whether the text is conveying honesty and disclosing (high value) versus more guarded, and distanced (low value). (2) Big five: Measures the five psychological properties (OCEAN), namely Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism. (3) Emotional Analysis: Measures the positive emotions conveyed in the text, and the negative emotions (including anger, sadness, anxiety). (4) Personal Drives: Focuses on five personal drives, namely power, reward, risk, achievement, and affiliation. (5) Personal Pronouns: Counts the number of 1st, 2nd, and 3rd personal pronouns used. For each Twitter user, we calculate their psychological profiles across these categories. Additionally, using Minkowski distance measure, we calculate the distance between each of these profiles and the average values of the psychological properties created from the ISIS magazines."}

{"input": "We propose a neural network architecture for learning vector representations of hotels. Unlike previous works, which typically only use user click information for learning item embeddings, we propose a framework that combines several sources of data, including user clicks, hotel attributes (e.g., property type, star rating, average user rating), amenity information (e.g., the hotel has free Wi-Fi or free breakfast), and geographic information. During model training, a joint embedding is learned from all of the above information. We show that including structured attributes about hotels enables us to make better predictions in a downstream task than when we rely exclusively on click data. We train our embedding model on more than 40 million user click sessions from a leading online travel platform and learn embeddings for more than one million hotels. Our final learned embeddings integrate distinct sub-embeddings for user clicks, hotel attributes, and geographic information, providing an interpretable representation that can be used flexibly depending on the application. We show empirically that our model generates high-quality representations that boost the performance of a hotel recommendation system in addition to other applications. An important advantage of the proposed neural model is that it addresses the cold-start problem for hotels with insufficient historical click information by incorporating additional hotel attributes which are available for all hotels.\nQuestion: what is the cold-start problem?", "output": "Dealing with hotels/items  that  appear infrequently or never in historical data and choosing appropriate weights for them is referred to as the \"cold start problem.\". Explanation: In practice, many hotels/items appear infrequently or never in historical data. Recommender systems typically have difficulty handling these items effectively due to the lack of relevant training data. Apart from the obvious negative impacts on searchability and sales, neglecting these items can introduce a feedback loop. That is, the less these items are recommended, or the more they are recommended in inappropriate circumstances, the more the data reinforces their apparent lack of popularity.\n\nDealing with such hotels/items and choosing appropriate weights for them is referred to as the \"cold start problem.\""}

We show empirically that our model generates high-quality representations that boost the performance of a hotel recommendation system in addition to other applications. An important advantage of the proposed neural model is that it addresses the cold-start problem for hotels with insufficient historical click information by incorporating additional hotel attributes which are available for all hotels.\nQuestion: how was the experiment evaluated?", "output": "the average number of times the correct selection appears in the top k predictions. Explanation: In this section, we compare our model based on the hits@k metric in various scenarios. Hits@k measures the average number of times the correct selection appears in the top k predictions."}
{"input": "We propose a neural network architecture for learning vector representations of hotels. Unlike previous works, which typically only use user click information for learning item embeddings, we propose a framework that combines several sources of data, including user clicks, hotel attributes (e.g., property type, star rating, average user rating), amenity information (e.g., the hotel has free Wi-Fi or free breakfast), and geographic information. During model training, a joint embedding is learned from all of the above information. We show that including structured attributes about hotels enables us to make better predictions in a downstream task than when we rely exclusively on click data.

{"input": "We focus on the cross-domain context-dependent text-to-SQL generation task. Based on the observation that adjacent natural language questions are often linguistically dependent and their corresponding SQL queries tend to overlap, we utilize the interaction history by editing the previous predicted query to improve the generation quality. Our editing mechanism views SQL as sequences and reuses generation results at the token level in a simple manner. It is flexible to change individual tokens and robust to error propagation. Furthermore, to deal with complex table structures in different domains, we employ an utterance-table encoder and a table-aware decoder to incorporate the context of the user utterance and the table schema. We evaluate our approach on the SParC dataset and demonstrate the benefit of editing compared with the state-of-the-art baselines which generate SQL from scratch.

{"input": "While dialogue remains an important end-goal of natural language research, the difficulty of evaluation is an oft-quoted reason why it remains troublesome to make real progress towards its solution. Evaluation difficulties are actually two-fold: not only do automatic metrics not correlate well with human judgments, but also human judgments themselves are in fact difficult to measure. The two most used human judgment tests, single-turn pairwise evaluation and multi-turn Likert scores, both have serious flaws as we discuss in this work.  ::: We instead provide a novel procedure involving comparing two full dialogues, where a human judge is asked to pay attention to only one speaker within each, and make a pairwise judgment. The questions themselves are optimized to maximize the robustness of judgments across different annotators, resulting in better tests.

We hope these tests become the de facto standard, and will release open-source code to that end.\nQuestion: Which dialogue data do they use to evaluate on?", "output": "Datasets from PersonaChat and Wizard of Wikipedia tasks..

In this paper, we design a sifted multi-task learning method with a selected sharing layer for fake news detection.

{"input": "We report on search errors and model errors in neural machine translation (NMT). We present an exact inference procedure for neural sequence models based on a combination of beam search and depth-first search. We use our exact search to find the global best model scores under a Transformer base model for the entire WMT15 English-German test set. Surprisingly, beam search fails to find these global best model scores in most cases, even with a very large beam size of 100. For more than 50% of the sentences, the model in fact assigns its global best score to the empty translation, revealing a massive failure of neural models in properly accounting for adequacy. We show by constraining search with a minimum translation length that at the root of the problem of empty translations lies an inherent bias towards shorter translations. We conclude that vanilla NMT in its current form requires just the right amount of beam search errors, which, from a modelling perspective, is a highly unsatisfactory conclusion indeed, as the model often prefers an empty translation.\nQuestion: what were the length constraints they set?", "output": "search to translations longer than 0.25 times the source sentence length.

Given a structured record, such as `(PLAYER: Lebron, POINTS: 20, ASSISTS: 10)', and a reference sentence, such as `Kobe easily dropped 30 points', we aim to generate a sentence that accurately describes the full content in the record, with the same writing style (e.g., wording, transitions) of the reference. The problem is unsupervised due to lack of parallel data in practice, and is challenging to minimally yet effectively manipulate the text (by rewriting/adding/deleting text portions) to ensure fidelity to the structured content. We derive a dataset from a basketball game report corpus as our testbed, and develop a neural method with unsupervised competing objectives and explicit content coverage constraints. Automatic and human evaluations show superiority of our approach over competitive methods including a strong rule-based baseline and prior approaches designed for style transfer.\nQuestion: Which content coverage constraints do they design?", "output": "Answer with content missing: (Content Coverage Constraint section) We thus devise an additional learning constraint based on the nature of content description\u2014each data tuple in the content record should usually be mentioned exactly once in the generated sentence.\nThe copy mechanism over content record x enables a simple yet effective way to encourage the behavior. Intuitively, we want each tuple to be copied once and only once on average.. Explanation: Model"}

{"input": "The goal of our paper is to semantically edit parts of an image matching a given text that describes desired attributes (e.g., texture, colour, and background), while preserving other contents that are irrelevant to the text. To achieve this, we propose a novel generative adversarial network (ManiGAN), which contains two key components: text-image affine combination module (ACM) and detail correction module (DCM). The ACM selects image regions relevant to the given text and then correlates the regions with corresponding semantic words for effective manipulation. Meanwhile, it encodes original image features to help reconstruct text-irrelevant contents. The DCM rectifies mismatched attributes and completes missing contents of the synthetic image. Finally, we suggest a new metric for evaluating image manipulation results, in terms of both the generation of new attributes and the reconstruction of text-irrelevant contents. Extensive experiments on the CUB and COCO datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method. Code is available at https://github.com/mrlibw/ManiGAN.\nQuestion: Which dataset do they use for text altering attributes matching to image parts?", "output": "CUB bird. Explanation: As shown in Table TABREF11, our method has the highest IS and MP values on both the CUB and COCO datasets compared with the state-of-the-art approaches, which demonstrates that (1) our method can produce high-quality manipulated results, and (2) our method can better generate new attributes matching the given text, and also effectively reconstruct text-irrelevant contents of the original image."}
{"input": "In sentiment analysis (SA) of product reviews, both user and product information are proven to be useful. Current tasks handle user profile and product information in a unified model which may not be able to learn salient features of users and products effectively. In this work, we propose a dual user and product memory network (DUPMN) model to learn user profiles and product reviews using separate memory networks. Then, the two representations are used jointly for sentiment prediction. The use of separate models aims to capture user profiles and product information more effectively. Compared to state-of-the-art unified prediction models, the evaluations on three benchmark datasets, IMDB, Yelp13, and Yelp14, show that our dual learning model gives performance gain of 0.6%, 1.2%, and 0.9%, respectively. The improvements are also deemed very significant measured by p-values.\nQuestion: What statistical test is performed?", "output": "t-test.

If the possibility exists, the system offers counter-evidences of opposite gender also being associated with the same occupation in the context of user-provided geography and timespan. The system thus enables text de-biasing by assisting a human-in-the-loop.

{"input": "In this paper, we introduce and tackle the Outline Generation (OG) task, which aims to unveil the inherent content structure of a multi-paragraph document by identifying its potential sections and generating the corresponding section headings. Without loss of generality, the OG task can be viewed as a novel structured summarization task. To generate a sound outline, an ideal OG model should be able to capture three levels of coherence, namely the coherence between context paragraphs, that between a section and its heading, and that between context headings. The first one is the foundation for section identification, while the latter two are critical for consistent heading generation. In this work, we formulate the OG task as a hierarchical structured prediction problem, i.e., to first predict a sequence of section boundaries and then a sequence of section headings accordingly. We propose a novel hierarchical structured neural generation model, named HiStGen, for the task. Our model attempts to capture the three-level coherence via the following ways. First, we introduce a Markov paragraph dependency mechanism between context paragraphs for section identification. Second, we employ a section-aware attention mechanism to ensure the semantic coherence between a section and its heading. Finally, we leverage a Markov heading dependency mechanism and a review mechanism between context headings to improve the consistency and eliminate duplication between section headings.

{"input": "Categories such as animal or furniture are acquired at an early age and play an important role in processing, organizing, and communicating world knowledge. Categories exist across cultures: they allow to efficiently represent the complexity of the world, and members of a community strongly agree on their nature, revealing a shared mental representation. Models of category learning and representation, however, are typically tested on data from small-scale experiments involving small sets of concepts with artificially restricted features; and experiments predominantly involve participants of selected cultural and socio-economical groups (very often involving western native speakers of English such as U.S. college students) . This work investigates whether models of categorization generalize (a) to rich and noisy data approximating the environment humans live in; and (b) across languages and cultures. We present a Bayesian cognitive model designed to jointly learn categories and their structured representation from natural language text which allows us to (a) evaluate performance on a large scale, and (b) apply our model to a diverse set of languages. We show that meaningful categories comprising hundreds of concepts and richly structured featural representations emerge across languages. Our work illustrates the potential of recent advances in computational modeling and large scale naturalistic datasets for cognitive science research.\nQuestion: what languages did they evaluate on?", "output": "Arabic, Chinese, French, English, and German.

{"input": "In this paper, we present a method for correcting automatic speech recognition (ASR) errors using a finite state transducer (FST) intent recognition framework. Intent recognition is a powerful technique for dialog flow management in turn-oriented, human-machine dialogs. This technique can also be very useful in the context of human-human dialogs, though it serves a different purpose of key insight extraction from conversations. We argue that currently available intent recognition techniques are not applicable to human-human dialogs due to the complex structure of turn-taking and various disfluencies encountered in spontaneous conversations, exacerbated by speech recognition errors and scarcity of domain-specific labeled data. Without efficient key insight extraction techniques, raw human-human dialog transcripts remain significantly unexploited.  ::: Our contribution consists of a novel FST for intent indexing and an algorithm for fuzzy intent search over the lattice - a compact graph encoding of ASR's hypotheses.

In this paper, we discuss and compare training algorithms for a unigram subword model, based on the Expectation Maximization algorithm and lexicon pruning. Using English, Finnish, North Sami, and Turkish data sets, we show that this approach is able to find better solutions to the optimization problem defined by the Morfessor Baseline model than its original recursive training algorithm.

{"input": "Princeton WordNet is one of the most important resources for natural language processing, but is only available for English. While it has been translated using the expand approach to many other languages, this is an expensive manual process. Therefore it would be beneficial to have a high-quality automatic translation approach that would support NLP techniques, which rely on WordNet in new languages. The translation of wordnets is fundamentally complex because of the need to translate all senses of a word including low frequency senses, which is very challenging for current machine translation approaches. For this reason we leverage existing translations of WordNet in other languages to identify contextual information for wordnet senses from a large set of generic parallel corpora. We evaluate our approach using 10 translated wordnets for European languages. Our experiment shows a significant improvement over translation without any contextual information. Furthermore, we evaluate how the choice of pivot languages affects performance of multilingual word sense disambiguation.\nQuestion: Which metrics do they use to evaluate results?", "output": "BLEU BIBREF35 , METEOR BIBREF36 and chrF BIBREF37 metrics.

{"input": "We investigate the political roles of \"Internet trolls\" in social media. Political trolls, such as the ones linked to the Russian Internet Research Agency (IRA), have recently gained enormous attention for their ability to sway public opinion and even influence elections. Analysis of the online traces of trolls has shown different behavioral patterns, which target different slices of the population. However, this analysis is manual and labor-intensive, thus making it impractical as a first-response tool for newly-discovered troll farms. In this paper, we show how to automate this analysis by using machine learning in a realistic setting. In particular, we show how to classify trolls according to their political role ---left, news feed, right--- by using features extracted from social media, i.e., Twitter, in two scenarios: (i) in a traditional supervised learning scenario, where labels for trolls are available, and (ii) in a distant supervision scenario, where labels for trolls are not available, and we rely on more-commonly-available labels for news outlets mentioned by the trolls. Technically, we leverage the community structure and the text of the messages in the online social network of trolls represented as a graph, from which we extract several types of learned representations, i.e.,~embeddings, for the trolls.

{"input": "LSTMs have proven very successful at language modeling. However, it remains unclear to what extent they are able to capture complex morphosyntactic structures. In this paper, we examine whether LSTMs are sensitive to verb argument structures. We introduce a German grammaticality dataset in which ungrammatical sentences are constructed by manipulating case assignments (eg substituting nominative by accusative or dative). We find that LSTMs are better than chance in detecting incorrect argument structures and slightly worse than humans tested on the same dataset. Surprisingly, LSTMs are contaminated by heuristics not found in humans like a preference toward nominative noun phrases. In other respects they show human-similar results like biases for particular orders of case assignments.\nQuestion: What are the performances of LSTMs and humans on the task?", "output": "mean AUC of 0.56 for the LTSM and of 0.58 for humans.

We find that the adversarial examples generated are semantics-preserving perturbations to the original text.\nQuestion: How does proposed reinforcement learning based approach generate adversarial examples in black-box settings?", "output": "Training ::: Training with Reinforcement learning\nWe fine-tune our model to fool a target classifier by learning a policy that maximizes a specific discrete metric formulated based on the constraints required to generate adversarial examples. In our work, we use the self-critical approach of Rennie et al. BIBREF36 as our policy gradient training algorithm.\n\nTraining ::: Training with Reinforcement learning ::: Self-critical sequence training (SCST)\nIn SCST approach, the model learns to gather more rewards from its sampled sequences that bring higher rewards than its best greedy counterparts. First, we compute two sequences: (a) $y^{\\prime }$ sampled from the model's distribution $p(y^{\\prime }_j|y^{\\prime }_{. Explanation: Proposed Attack Strategy\nLet us consider a target model $T$ and $(x,l)$ refers to the samples from the dataset. Given an instance $x$, the goal of the adversary is to generate adversarial examples $x^{\\prime }$ such that $T(x^{\\prime }) \\ne l$, where $l$ denotes the true label i.e take one of the $K$ classes of the target classification model. The changes made to $x$ to get $x^{\\prime }$ are called perturbations. We would like to have $x^{\\prime }$ close to the original instance $x$. In a black box setting, we do not have knowledge about the internals of the target model or its training data. Previous work by Papernot et al. BIBREF14 train a separate substitute classifier such that it can mimic the decision boundaries of the target classifier. The substitute classifier is then used to craft adversarial examples. While these techniques have been applied for image classification models, such methods have not been explored extensively for text.\n\nWe implement both the substitute network training and adversarial example generation using an encoder-decoder architecture called Adversarial Examples Generator (AEG). The encoder extracts the character and word information from the input text and produces hidden representations of words considering its sequence context information. A substitute network is not implemented separately but applied using an attention mechanism to weigh the encoded hidden states based on their relevance to making predictions closer to target model outputs. The attention scores provide certain level of interpretability to the model as the regions of text that need to perturbed can be identified and visualized. The decoder uses the attention scores obtained from the substitute network, combines it with decoder state information to decide if perturbation is required at this state or not and finally emits the text unit (a text unit may refer to a word or character). Inspired by a work by Luong et al. BIBREF25, the decoder is a word and character-level recurrent network employed to generate adversarial examples. Before the substitute network is trained, we pretrain our encoder-decoder model on common misspellings and paraphrase datasets to empower the model to produce character and word perturbations in the form of misspellings or paraphrases. For training substitute network and generation of adversarial examples, we randomly draw data that is disjoint from the training data of the black-box model since we assume the adversaries have no prior knowledge about the training data or the model. Specifically, we consider attacking a target classifier by generating adversarial examples based on unseen input examples. This is done by dividing the dataset into training, validation and test using 60-30-10 ratio. The training data is used by the target model, while the unseen validation samples are used with necessary data augmentation for our AEG model. We further improve our model by using a self-critical approach to finally generate better adversarial examples. The rewards are formulated based on the following goals: (a) fool the target classifier, (b) minimize the number of perturbations and (c) preserve the semantics of the text."}

{"input": "Language change is a complex social phenomenon, revealing pathways of communication and sociocultural influence. But, while language change has long been a topic of study in sociolinguistics, traditional linguistic research methods rely on circumstantial evidence, estimating the direction of change from differences between older and younger speakers. In this paper, we use a data set of several million Twitter users to track language changes in progress. First, we show that language change can be viewed as a form of social influence: we observe complex contagion for phonetic spellings and\"netspeak\"abbreviations (e.g., lol), but not for older dialect markers from spoken language. Next, we test whether specific types of social network connections are more influential than others, using a parametric Hawkes process model. We find that tie strength plays an important role: densely embedded social ties are significantly better conduits of linguistic influence. Geographic locality appears to play a more limited role: we find relatively little evidence to support the hypothesis that individuals are more influenced by geographically local social ties, even in their usage of geographical dialect markers.\nQuestion: What sociolinguistic variables (phonetic spellings) did they analyze?", "output": "variation and change in the use of words characteristic from eight US cities that have non-standard spellings.

We show that the best K source domains returned by our similarity metrics have a precision of over 50%, for varying values of K.\nQuestion: What similarity metrics have been tried?", "output": "LM1: Significant Words Overlap. Explanation: When target domain data is labelled, we use the following four metrics for comparing and ranking source domains for a particular target domain:\n\nSimilarity Metrics ::: Metrics: Labelled Data ::: LM1: Significant Words Overlap\nAll words in a domain are not significant for sentiment expression. For example, comfortable is significant in the `Clothing' domain but not as significant in the `Movie' domain. In this metric, we build upon existing work by sharma2018identifying and extract significant words from each domain using the $\\chi ^2$ test. This method relies on computing the statistical significance of a word based on the polarity of that word in the domain. For our experiments, we consider only the words which appear at least 10 times in the corpus and have a $\\chi ^2$ value greater than or equal to 1. The $\\chi ^2$ value is calculated as follows:\n\nWhere ${c_p}^w$ and ${c_n}^w$ are the observed counts of word $w$ in positive and negative reviews, respectively. $\\mu ^w$ is the expected count, which is kept as half of the total number of occurrences of $w$ in the corpus. We hypothesize that, if a domain-pair $(D_1,D_2)$ shares a larger number of significant words than the pair $(D_1,D_3)$, then $D_1$ is closer to $D_2$ as compared to $D_3$, since they use relatively higher number of similar words for sentiment expression. For every target domain, we compute the intersection of significant words with all other domains and rank them on the basis of intersection count. The utility of this metric is that it can also be used in a scenario where target domain data is unlabelled, but source domain data is labelled. It is due to the fact that once we obtain significant words in the source domain, we just need to search for them in the target domain to find out common significant words.\n\nSimilarity Metrics ::: Metrics: Labelled Data ::: LM2: Symmetric KL-Divergence (SKLD)\nKL Divergence can be used to compare the probabilistic distribution of polar words in two domains BIBREF10. A lower KL Divergence score indicates that the probabilistic distribution of polar words in two domains is identical. This implies that the domains are close to each other, in terms of sentiment similarity. Therefore, to rank source domains for a target domain using this metric, we inherit the concept of symmetric KL Divergence proposed by murthy2018judicious and use it to compute average Symmetric KL-Divergence of common polar words shared by a domain-pair. We label a word as `polar' for a domain if,\n\nwhere $P$ is the probability of a word appearing in a review which is labelled positive and $N$ is the probability of a word appearing in a review which is labelled negative.\n\nSKLD of a polar word for domain-pair $(D_1,D_2)$ is calculated as:\n\nwhere $P_i$ and $N_i$ are probabilities of a word appearing under positively labelled and negatively labelled reviews, respectively, in domain $i$. We then take an average of all common polar words.\n\nWe observe that, on its own, this metric performs rather poorly. Upon careful analysis of results, we concluded that the imbalance in the number of polar words being shared across domain-pairs is a reason for poor performance. To mitigate this, we compute a confidence term for a domain-pair $(D_1,D_2)$ using the Jaccard Similarity Coefficient which is calculated as follows:\n\nwhere $C$ is the number of common polar words and $W_1$ and $W_2$ are number of polar words in $D_1$ and $D_2$ respectively. The intuition behind this being that the domain-pairs having higher percentage of polar words overlap should be ranked higher compared to those having relatively higher number of polar words. For example, we prefer $(C:40,W_1 :50,W_2 :50)$ over $(C:200,W_1 :500,W_2 :500)$ even though 200 is greater than 40. To compute the final similarity value, we add the reciprocal of $J$ to the SKLD value since a larger value of $J$ will add a smaller fraction to SLKD value. For a smaller SKLD value, the domains would be relatively more similar. This is computed as follows:\n\nDomain pairs are ranked in increasing order of this similarity value. After the introduction of the confidence term, a significant improvement in the results is observed.\n\nSimilarity Metrics ::: Metrics: Labelled Data ::: LM3: Chameleon Words Similarity\nThis metric is our novel contribution for domain adaptability evaluation. It helps in detection of `Chameleon Word(s)' which change their polarity across domains BIBREF11. The motivation comes from the fact that chameleon words directly affect the CDSA accuracy. For example, poignant is positive in movie domain whereas negative in many other domains viz. Beauty, Clothing etc.\n\nFor every common polar word between two domains, $L_1 \\ Distance$ between two vectors $[P_1,N_1]$ and $[P_2,N_2]$ is calculated as;\n\nThe overall distance is an average overall common polar words. Similar to SKLD, the confidence term based on Jaccard Similarity Coefficient is used to counter the imbalance of common polar word count between domain-pairs.\n\nDomain pairs are ranked in increasing order of final value.\n\nSimilarity Metrics ::: Metrics: Labelled Data ::: LM4: Entropy Change\nEntropy is the degree of randomness. A relatively lower change in entropy, when two domains are concatenated, indicates that the two domains contain similar topics and are therefore closer to each other. This metric is also our novel contribution. Using this metric, we calculate the percentage change in the entropy when the target domain is concatenated with the source domain. We calculate the entropy as the combination of entropy for unigrams, bigrams, trigrams, and quadrigrams. We consider only polar words for unigrams. For bi, tri and quadrigrams, we give priority to polar words by using a weighted entropy function and this weighted entropy $E$ is calculated as:\n\nHere, $X$ is the set of n-grams that contain at least one polar word, $Y$ is the set of n-grams which do not contain any polar word, and $w$ is the weight. For our experiments, we keep the value of $w$ as 1 for unigrams and 5 for bi, tri, and quadrigrams.\n\nWe then say that a source domain $D_2$ is more suitable for target domain $D_1$ as compared to source domain $D_3$ if;\n\nwhere $D_2+D_1$ indicates combined data obtained by mixing $D_1$ in $D_2$ and $\\Delta E$ indicates percentage change in entropy before and after mixing of source and target domains.\n\nNote that this metric offers the advantage of asymmetricity, unlike the other three metrics for labelled data."}

{"input": "Traditional sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models and other variations of the attention-mechanism such as hierarchical attention have been applied to the text summarization problem. Though there is a hierarchy in the way humans use language by forming paragraphs from sentences and sentences from words, hierarchical models have usually not worked that much better than their traditional seq2seq counterparts. This effect is mainly because either the hierarchical attention mechanisms are too sparse using hard attention or noisy using soft attention. In this paper, we propose a method based on extracting the highlights of a document; a key concept that is conveyed in a few sentences. In a typical text summarization dataset consisting of documents that are 800 tokens in length (average), capturing long-term dependencies is very important, e.g., the last sentence can be grouped with the first sentence of a document to form a summary. LSTMs (Long Short-Term Memory) proved useful for machine translation. However, they often fail to capture long-term dependencies while modeling long sequences. To address these issues, we have adapted Neural Semantic Encoders (NSE) to text summarization, a class of memory-augmented neural networks by improving its functionalities and proposed a novel hierarchical NSE that outperforms similar previous models significantly. The quality of summarization was improved by augmenting linguistic factors, namely lemma, and Part-of-Speech (PoS) tags, to each word in the dataset for improved vocabulary coverage and generalization. The hierarchical NSE model on factored dataset outperformed the state-of-the-art by nearly 4 ROUGE points. We further designed and used the first GPU-based self-critical Reinforcement Learning model.\nQuestion: How is GPU-based self-critical Reinforcement Learing model designed?", "output": "We used the self-critical model of BIBREF13 proposed for image captioning. Explanation: We used the self-critical model of BIBREF13 proposed for image captioning. In self-critical sequence training, the REINFORCE algorithm BIBREF20 is used by modifying its baseline as the greedy output of the current model. At each time-step $t$, the model predicts two words: $\\hat{y}_{t}$ sampled from $p(\\hat{y}_{t} | \\hat{y}_{1}, \\hat{y}_{2}, ..., \\hat{y}_{t-1}, x)$, the baseline output that is greedily generated by considering the most probable word from the vocabulary and $\\tilde{y}_{t}$ sampled from the $p(\\tilde{y}_{t} | \\tilde{y}_{1}, \\tilde{y}_{2}, ..., \\tilde{y}_{t-1}, x)$. This model is trained using the following loss function:\n\nUsing the above training objective, the model learns to generate samples with high probability and thereby increasing $r(\\tilde{y})$ above $r(\\hat{y})$. Additionally, we have used enthttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/19053077/looping-over-data-and-creating-individual-figuresropy regularization.\n\nWhere, $p(\\tilde{y}_{t})=p(\\tilde{y}_{t} | \\tilde{y}_{1}, \\tilde{y}_{2}, ..., \\tilde{y}_{t-1}, x)$ is the sampling probability and $V$ is the size of the vocabulary. It is similar to the exploration-exploitation trade-off. $\\alpha $ is the regularization coefficient that explicitly controls this trade-off: a higher $\\alpha $ corresponds to more exploration, and a lower $\\alpha $ corresponds to more exploitation. We have found that all TensorFlow based open-source implementations of self-critic models use a function (tf.py_func) that runs only on CPU and it is very slow. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first GPU based implementation."}

{"input": "This paper treats gender bias latent in word embeddings. Previous mitigation attempts rely on the operationalisation of gender bias as a projection over a linear subspace. An alternative approach is Counterfactual Data Augmentation (CDA), in which a corpus is duplicated and augmented to remove bias, e.g. by swapping all inherently-gendered words in the copy. We perform an empirical comparison of these approaches on the English Gigaword and Wikipedia, and find that whilst both successfully reduce direct bias and perform well in tasks which quantify embedding quality, CDA variants outperform projection-based methods at the task of drawing non-biased gender analogies by an average of 19% across both corpora. We propose two improvements to CDA: Counterfactual Data Substitution (CDS), a variant of CDA in which potentially biased text is randomly substituted to avoid duplication, and the Names Intervention, a novel name-pairing technique that vastly increases the number of words being treated. CDA/S with the Names Intervention is the only approach which is able to mitigate indirect gender bias: following debiasing, previously biased words are significantly less clustered according to gender (cluster purity is reduced by 49%), thus improving on the state-of-the-art for bias mitigation.\nQuestion: How is cluster purity measured?", "output": "V-measure. Explanation: For each debiased embedding we then project these words into 2D space with tSNE BIBREF15, compute clusters with k-means, and calculate the clusters' V-measure BIBREF16."}

{"input": "We study the problem of semantic matching in product search, that is, given a customer query, retrieve all semantically related products from the catalog.

To address these issues, we train a deep learning model for semantic matching using customer behavior data. Much of the recent work on large-scale semantic search using deep learning focuses on ranking for web search. In contrast, semantic matching for product search presents several novel challenges, which we elucidate in this paper. We address these challenges by a) developing a new loss function that has an inbuilt threshold to differentiate between random negative examples, impressed but not purchased examples, and positive examples (purchased items), b) using average pooling in conjunction with n-grams to capture short-range linguistic patterns, c) using hashing to handle out of vocabulary tokens, and d) using a model parallel training architecture to scale across 8 GPUs.

{"input": "Nigerian English adaptation, Pidgin, has evolved over the years through multi-language code switching, code mixing and linguistic adaptation. While Pidgin preserves many of the words in the normal English language corpus, both in spelling and pronunciation, the fundamental meaning of these words have changed significantly. For example,'ginger' is not a plant but an expression of motivation and 'tank' is not a container but an expression of gratitude. The implication is that the current approach of using direct English sentiment analysis of social media text from Nigeria is sub-optimal, as it will not be able to capture the semantic variation and contextual evolution in the contemporary meaning of these words. In practice, while many words in Nigerian Pidgin adaptation are the same as the standard English, the full English language based sentiment analysis models are not designed to capture the full intent of the Nigerian pidgin when used alone or code-mixed. By augmenting scarce human labelled code-changed text with ample synthetic code-reformatted text and meaning, we achieve significant improvements in sentiment scoring.

{"input": "Ensembling is a well-known technique in neural machine translation (NMT) to improve system performance. Instead of a single neural net, multiple neural nets with the same topology are trained separately, and the decoder generates predictions by averaging over the individual models. Ensembling often improves the quality of the generated translations drastically. However, it is not suitable for production systems because it is cumbersome and slow. This work aims to reduce the runtime to be on par with a single system without compromising the translation quality. First, we show that the ensemble can be unfolded into a single large neural network which imitates the output of the ensemble system. We show that unfolding can already improve the runtime in practice since more work can be done on the GPU. We proceed by describing a set of techniques to shrink the unfolded network by reducing the dimensionality of layers.

We found that (i) people of higher socioeconomic status, active to a greater degree during the daytime, use a more standard language; (ii) the southern part of the country is more prone to use more standard language than the northern one, while locally the used variety or dialect is determined by the spatial distribution of socioeconomic status; and (iii) individuals connected in the social network are closer linguistically than disconnected ones, even after the effects of status homophily have been removed. Our results inform sociolinguistic theory and may inspire novel learning methods for the inference of socioeconomic status of people from the way they tweet.\nQuestion: How do they combine the socioeconomic maps with Twitter data?", "output": "Match geolocation data for Twitter users with patches from INSEE socioeconomic maps.. Explanation: To overcome this limitation we combined our Twitter data with the socioeconomic maps of INSEE by assigning each geolocated Twitter user to a patch closest to their estimated home location (within 1 km). This way we obtained for all $110,369$ geolocated users their dynamical linguistic data, their egocentric social network as well as a set of SES indicators."}

Our results inform sociolinguistic theory and may inspire novel learning methods for the inference of socioeconomic status of people from the way they tweet.\nQuestion: Does the fact that people are active during the day time define their SEC?", "output": "No, but the authors identified a correlation.. Explanation: It turned out that people active during the day have higher average income (warmer colors in Fig. 4 ) than people active during the night (colder colors in Fig. 4 ). Thus the variability of standard language patterns was largely explained by the changing overall composition of active Twitter users during different times of day and the positive correlation between socioeconomic status and the usage of higher linguistic standards (that we have seen earlier). This explanation was supported by the high coefficients (summarized in Table 3 ), which were indicative of strong and significant correlations between the temporal variability of average linguistic variables and average income of the active population on Twitter."}

Explanation: The basic form of negation in French includes two negative particles: ne (no) before the verb and another particle after the verb that conveys more accurate meaning: pas (not), jamais (never), personne (no one), rien (nothing), etc. Due to this double construction, the first part of the negation (ne) is optional in spoken French, but it is obligatory in standard writing."}

Using this set of locations we selected the most frequent to be the representative one, and we took it as a proxy for the user's home location."}

Previous work have studied whether fake news and satire can be distinguished based on language differences. Contrary to fake news, satire stories are usually humorous and carry some political or social message. We hypothesize that these nuances could be identified using semantic and linguistic cues.

We incorporate BERT into the multi-head selection framework for joint entity-relation extraction. This model extends existing approaches from three perspectives. First, BERT is adopted as a feature extraction layer at the bottom of the multi-head selection framework. We further optimize BERT by introducing a semantic-enhanced task during BERT pre-training. Second, we introduce a large-scale Baidu Baike corpus for entity recognition pre-training, which is of weekly supervised learning since there is no actual named entity label. Third, soft label embedding is proposed to effectively transmit information between entity recognition and relation extraction. Combining these three contributions, we enhance the information extracting ability of the multi-head selection model and achieve F1-score 0.876 on testset-1 with a single model. By ensembling four variants of our model, we finally achieve F1 score 0.892 (1st place) on testset-1 and F1 score 0.8924 (2nd place) on testset-2.\nQuestion: What is the weak supervision signal used in Baidu Baike corpus?", "output": "consider the title of each sample as a pseudo label and conduct NER pre-training.

Although a systematic study of such biases can be difficult, we believe that automated translation tools can be exploited through gender neutral languages to yield a window into the phenomenon of gender bias in AI. In this paper, we start with a comprehensive list of job positions from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) and used it to build sentences in constructions like\"He/She is an Engineer\"in 12 different gender neutral languages such as Hungarian, Chinese, Yoruba, and several others. We translate these sentences into English using the Google Translate API, and collect statistics about the frequency of female, male and gender-neutral pronouns in the translated output. We show that GT exhibits a strong tendency towards male defaults, in particular for fields linked to unbalanced gender distribution such as STEM jobs. We ran these statistics against BLS' data for the frequency of female participation in each job position, showing that GT fails to reproduce a real-world distribution of female workers. We provide experimental evidence that even if one does not expect in principle a 50:50 pronominal gender distribution, GT yields male defaults much more frequently than what would be expected from demographic data alone.

{"input": "The broad goal of information extraction is to derive structured information from unstructured data. However, most existing methods focus solely on text, ignoring other types of unstructured data such as images, video and audio which comprise an increasing portion of the information on the web. To address this shortcoming, we propose the task of multimodal attribute extraction. Given a collection of unstructured and semi-structured contextual information about an entity (such as a textual description, or visual depictions) the task is to extract the entity's underlying attributes. In this paper, we provide a dataset containing mixed-media data for over 2 million product items along with 7 million attribute-value pairs describing the items which can be used to train attribute extractors in a weakly supervised manner. We provide a variety of baselines which demonstrate the relative effectiveness of the individual modes of information towards solving the task, as well as study human performance.\nQuestion: How many different semi-structured templates are represented in the data?", "output": "7.6 million.

In this paper, we show that the signal from instance-level human caption ratings can be leveraged to improve captioning models, even when the amount of caption ratings is several orders of magnitude less than the caption training data. We employ a policy gradient method to maximize the human ratings as rewards in an off-policy reinforcement learning setting, where policy gradients are estimated by samples from a distribution that focuses on the captions in a caption ratings dataset. Our empirical evidence indicates that the proposed method learns to generalize the human raters' judgments to a previously unseen set of images, as judged by a different set of human judges, and additionally on a different, multi-dimensional side-by-side human evaluation procedure.\nQuestion: What are the baseline models?", "output": "MLE model. Explanation: We first train an MLE model as our baseline, trained on the Conceptual Captions training split alone. We referred to this model as Baseline. For a baseline approach that utilizes (some of) the Caption-Quality data, we merge positively-rated captions from the Caption-Quality training split with the Conceptual Captions examples and finetune the baseline model. We call this model Baseline$+(t)$, where $t \\in [0,1]$ is the rating threshold for the included positive captions. We train models for two variants, $t\\in \\lbrace 0.5, 0.7\\rbrace $, which results in $\\sim $72K and $\\sim $51K additional (pseudo-)ground-truth captions, respectively. Note that the Baseline$+(t)$ approaches attempt to make use of the same additional dataset as our two reinforced models, OnPG and OffPG, but they need to exclude below-threshold captions due to the constraints in MLE."}

The learning rate is warmed up for 20 epochs and exponentially decayed by a factor of 0.95 every 25 epochs.

{"input": "Rule-based techniques and tools to extract entities and relational entities from documents allow users to specify desired entities using natural language questions, finite state automata, regular expressions, structured query language statements, or proprietary scripts. These techniques and tools require expertise in linguistics and programming and lack support of Arabic morphological analysis which is key to process Arabic text. In this work, we present MERF; a morphology-based entity and relational entity extraction framework for Arabic text. MERF provides a user-friendly interface where the user, with basic knowledge of linguistic features and regular expressions, defines tag types and interactively associates them with regular expressions defined over Boolean formulae. Boolean formulae range over matches of Arabic morphological features, and synonymity features. Users define user defined relations with tuples of subexpression matches and can associate code actions with subexpressions. MERF computes feature matches, regular expression matches, and constructs entities and relational entities from user defined relations. We evaluated our work with several case studies and compared with existing application-specific techniques. The results show that MERF requires shorter development time and effort compared to existing techniques and produces reasonably accurate results within a reasonable overhead in run time.\nQuestion: What existing techniques do the authors compare against?", "output": "ANGE, ATEEMA, GENTREE, and NUMNORM.

{"input": "The main approach of traditional information retrieval (IR) is to examine how many words from a query appear in a document. A drawback of this approach, however, is that it may fail to detect relevant documents where no or only few words from a query are found. The semantic analysis methods such as LSA (latent semantic analysis) and LDA (latent Dirichlet allocation) have been proposed to address the issue, but their performance is not superior compared to common IR approaches. Here we present a query-document similarity measure motivated by the Word Mover's Distance. Unlike other similarity measures, the proposed method relies on neural word embeddings to calculate the distance between words. Our method is efficient and straightforward to implement. The experimental results on TREC and PubMed show that our approach provides significantly better performance than BM25.

Explanation: First, following Kusner et al. Kusner2015, documents are represented by normalized bag-of-words (BOW) vectors, i.e. if a word INLINEFORM0 appears INLINEFORM1 times in a document, the weight is DISPLAYFORM0\n\nwhere INLINEFORM0 is number of words in the document. The higher the weight, the more important the word. They assume a word embedding so that each word INLINEFORM1 has an associated vector INLINEFORM2 ."}

{"input": "Deep learning has revolutionized speech recognition, image recognition, and natural language processing since 2010, each involving a single modality in the input signal. However, many applications in artificial intelligence involve more than one modality. It is therefore of broad interest to study the more difficult and complex problem of modeling and learning across multiple modalities. In this paper, a technical review of the models and learning methods for multimodal intelligence is provided. The main focus is the combination of vision and natural language, which has become an important area in both computer vision and natural language processing research communities. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of recent work on multimodal deep learning from three angles --- learning multimodal representations, the fusion of multimodal signals at various levels, and multimodal applications. On multimodal representation learning, we review the key concept of embedding, which unifies the multimodal signals into the same vector space and thus enables cross-modality signal processing. We also review the properties of the many types of embedding constructed and learned for general downstream tasks. On multimodal fusion, this review focuses on special architectures for the integration of the representation of unimodal signals for a particular task. On applications, selected areas of a broad interest in current literature are covered, including image-to-text caption generation, text-to-image generation, and visual question answering. We believe this review can facilitate future studies in the emerging field of multimodal intelligence for the community.\nQuestion: What are special architectures this review focuses on that are related to multimodal fusion?", "output": "attention mechanism.

{"input": "Very deep CNNs achieve state-of-the-art results in both computer vision and speech recognition, but are difficult to train. The most popular way to train very deep CNNs is to use shortcut connections (SC) together with batch normalization (BN). Inspired by Self- Normalizing Neural Networks, we propose the self-normalizing deep CNN (SNDCNN) based acoustic model topology, by removing the SC/BN and replacing the typical RELU activations with scaled exponential linear unit (SELU) in ResNet-50. SELU activations make the network self-normalizing and remove the need for both shortcut connections and batch normalization. Compared to ResNet- 50, we can achieve the same or lower (up to 4.5% relative) word error rate (WER) while boosting both training and inference speed by 60%-80%.

Explanation: The emergence of deep-learning architectures have led to the development of the VQA systems. We discuss the state-of-the-art methods with an overview in Table TABREF6.\n\nVanilla VQA BIBREF0: Considered as a benchmark for deep learning methods, the vanilla VQA model uses CNN for feature extraction and LSTM or Recurrent networks for language processing. These features are combined using element-wise operations to a common feature, which is used to classify to one of the answers as shown in Fig. FIGREF4.\n\nStacked Attention Networks BIBREF11: This model introduced the attention using the softmax output of the intermediate question feature. The attention between the features are stacked which helps the model to focus on the important portion of the image.\n\nTeney et al. Model BIBREF13: Teney et al. introduced the use of object detection on VQA models and won the VQA Challenge 2017. The model helps in narrowing down the features and apply better attention to images. The model employs the use of R-CNN architecture and showed significant performance in accuracy over other architectures.\n\nNeural-Symbolic VQA BIBREF23: Specifically made for CLEVR dataset, this model leverages the question formation and image generation strategy of CLEVR. The images are converted to structured features and the question features are converted to their original root question strategy. This feature is used to filter out the required answer.\n\nFocal Visual Text Attention (FVTA) BIBREF24: This model combines the sequence of image features generated by the network, text features of the image (or probable answers) and the question. It applies the attention based on the both text components, and finally classifies the features to answer the question. This model is better suited for the VQA in videos which has more use cases than images.\n\nPythia v1.0 BIBREF27: Pythia v1.0 is the award winning architecture for VQA Challenge 2018. The architecture is similar to Teney et al. BIBREF13 with reduced computations with element-wise multiplication, use of GloVe vectors BIBREF22, and ensemble of 30 models.\n\nDifferential Networks BIBREF19: This model uses the differences between forward propagation steps to reduce the noise and to learn the interdependency between features. Image features are extracted using Faster-RCNN BIBREF21. The differential modules BIBREF29 are used to refine the features in both text and images. GRU BIBREF30 is used for question feature extraction. Finally, it is combined with an attention module to classify the answers.

{"input": "With the ever-growing generation of data for the Semantic Web comes an increasing demand for this data to be made available to non-semantic Web experts. One way of achieving this goal is to translate the languages of the Semantic Web into natural language. We present LD2NL, a framework for verbalizing the three key languages of the Semantic Web, i.e., RDF, OWL, and SPARQL. Our framework is based on a bottom-up approach to verbalization. We evaluated LD2NL in an open survey with 86 persons. Our results suggest that our framework can generate verbalizations that are close to natural languages and that can be easily understood by non-experts. Therewith, it enables non-domain experts to interpret Semantic Web data with more than 91\\% of the accuracy of domain experts.\nQuestion: What is the Semantic Web?", "output": "aims to make information available on the Web easier to process for machines and humans.

{"input": "Concept-to-text generation typically employs a pipeline architecture, which often leads to suboptimal texts. Content selection, for example, may greedily select the most important facts, which may require, however, too many words to express, and this may be undesirable when space is limited or expensive. Selecting other facts, possibly only slightly less important, may allow the lexicalization stage to use much fewer words, or to report more facts in the same space. Decisions made during content selection and lexicalization may also lead to more or fewer sentence aggregation opportunities, affecting the length and readability of the resulting texts. Building upon on a publicly available state of the art natural language generator for Semantic Web ontologies, this article presents an Integer Linear Programming model that, unlike pipeline architectures, jointly considers choices available in content selection, lexicalization, and sentence aggregation to avoid greedy local decisions and produce more compact texts, i.e., texts that report more facts per word. Compact texts are desirable, for example, when generating advertisements to be included in Web search results, or when summarizing structured information in limited space. An extended version of the proposed model also considers a limited form of referring expression generation and avoids redundant sentences. An approximation of the two models can be used when longer texts need to be generated. Experiments with three ontologies confirm that the proposed models lead to more compact texts, compared to pipeline systems, with no deterioration or with improvements in the perceived quality of the generated texts.\nQuestion: Which ontologies did they use?", "output": "We experimented with three owl ontologies: (1) the Wine Ontology, which provides information about wines, wine producers etc.; (2) the Consumer Electronics Ontology, intended to help exchange information about consumer electronics products; and (3) the Disease Ontology, which describes diseases, including their symptoms, causes etc..

{"input": "The majority of conversations a dialogue agent sees over its lifetime occur after it has already been trained and deployed, leaving a vast store of potential training signal untapped. In this work, we propose the self-feeding chatbot, a dialogue agent with the ability to extract new training examples from the conversations it participates in. As our agent engages in conversation, it also estimates user satisfaction in its responses. When the conversation appears to be going well, the user's responses become new training examples to imitate. When the agent believes it has made a mistake, it asks for feedback; learning to predict the feedback that will be given improves the chatbot's dialogue abilities further. On the PersonaChat chit-chat dataset with over 131k training examples, we find that learning from dialogue with a self-feeding chatbot significantly improves performance, regardless of the amount of traditional supervision.\nQuestion: how is user satisfaction estimated?", "output": "Workers chatted with our baseline dialogue agent and assigned a rating 1-5 for the quality of each of the agent's responses. Contexts with rating 1 were mapped to the negative class (dissatisfied) and ratings INLINEFORM0 mapped to the positive class (satisfied)..

Contexts with rating 1 were mapped to the negative class (dissatisfied) and ratings INLINEFORM0 mapped to the positive class (satisfied). Contexts with rating 2 were discarded to increase the separation between classes for a cleaner training set.

{"input": "Today's research progress in the field of multi-document summarization is obstructed by the small number of available datasets. Since the acquisition of reference summaries is costly, existing datasets contain only hundreds of samples at most, resulting in heavy reliance on hand-crafted features or necessitating additional, manually annotated data. The lack of large corpora therefore hinders the development of sophisticated models. Additionally, most publicly available multi-document summarization corpora are in the news domain, and no analogous dataset exists in the video game domain. In this paper, we propose GameWikiSum, a new domain-specific dataset for multi-document summarization, which is one hundred times larger than commonly used datasets, and in another domain than news. Input documents consist of long professional video game reviews as well as references of their gameplay sections in Wikipedia pages. We analyze the proposed dataset and show that both abstractive and extractive models can be trained on it.

{"input": "Neural machine translation (NMT) typically adopts the encoder-decoder framework. A good understanding of the characteristics and functionalities of the encoder and decoder can help to explain the pros and cons of the framework, and design better models for NMT. In this work, we conduct an empirical study on the encoder and the decoder in NMT, taking Transformer as an example. We find that 1) the decoder handles an easier task than the encoder in NMT, 2) the decoder is more sensitive to the input noise than the encoder, and 3) the preceding words/tokens in the decoder provide strong conditional information, which accounts for the two observations above. We hope those observations can shed light on the characteristics of the encoder and decoder and inspire future research on NMT.\nQuestion: How do they determine that a decoder handles an easier task than the encoder?", "output": "adding more layers to the encoder achieves larger improvements than adding more layers to the decoder. Explanation: 1) We find that adding more layers to the encoder achieves larger improvements than adding more layers to the decoder. 2) We also compare the training time of the encoder and decoder by fixing the parameters of a well-trained decoder (encoder), and just update the parameters of the encoder (decoder). We found that the decoder converges faster than the encoder."}

{"input": "This paper describes our participation in Task 5 track 2 of SemEval 2017 to predict the sentiment of financial news headlines for a specific company on a continuous scale between -1 and 1. We tackled the problem using a number of approaches, utilising a Support Vector Regression (SVR) and a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BLSTM). We found an improvement of 4-6% using the LSTM model over the SVR and came fourth in the track. We report a number of different evaluations using a finance specific word embedding model and reflect on the effects of using different evaluation metrics.\nQuestion: Which evaluation metrics do they use?", "output": "Metric 1. Explanation: The main evaluation over the test data is based on the best performing SVR and the two BLSTM models once trained on all of the training data. The result table TABREF28 shows three columns based on the three evaluation metrics that the organisers have used. Metric 1 is the original metric, weighted cosine similarity (the metric used to evaluate the final version of the results, where we were ranked 5th; metric provided on the task website). This was then changed after the evaluation deadline to equation EQREF25 (which we term metric 2; this is what the first version of the results were actually based on, where we were ranked 4th), which then changed by the organisers to their equation as presented in BIBREF18 (which we term metric 3 and what the second version of the results were based on, where we were ranked 5th).\n\nAs you can see from the results table TABREF28 , the difference between the metrics is quite substantial. This is due to the system's optimisation being based on metric 1 rather than 2. Metric 2 is a classification metric for sentences with one aspect as it penalises values that are of opposite sign (giving -1 score) and rewards values with the same sign (giving +1 score). Our systems are not optimised for this because it would predict scores of -0.01 and true value of 0.01 as very close (within vector of other results) with low error whereas metric 2 would give this the highest error rating of -1 as they are not the same sign. Metric 3 is more similar to metric 1 as shown by the results, however the crucial difference is that again if you get opposite signs it will penalise more. We analysed the top 50 errors based on Mean Absolute Error (MAE) in the test dataset specifically to examine the number of sentences containing more than one aspect. Our investigation shows that no one system is better at predicting the sentiment of sentences that have more than one aspect (i.e. company) within them. Within those top 50 errors we found that the BLSTM systems do not know which parts of the sentence are associated to the company the sentiment is with respect to. Also they do not know the strength/existence of certain sentiment words."}

{"input": "Training data for NLP tasks often exhibits gender bias in that fewer sentences refer to women than to men. In Neural Machine Translation (NMT) gender bias has been shown to reduce translation quality, particularly when the target language has grammatical gender. The recent WinoMT challenge set allows us to measure this effect directly (Stanovsky et al, 2019). Ideally we would reduce system bias by simply debiasing all data prior to training, but achieving this effectively is itself a challenge. Rather than attempt to create a `balanced' dataset, we use transfer learning on a small set of trusted, gender-balanced examples. This approach gives strong and consistent improvements in gender debiasing with much less computational cost than training from scratch. A known pitfall of transfer learning on new domains is `catastrophic forgetting', which we address both in adaptation and in inference. During adaptation we show that Elastic Weight Consolidation allows a performance trade-off between general translation quality and bias reduction. During inference we propose a lattice-rescoring scheme which outperforms all systems evaluated in Stanovsky et al (2019) on WinoMT with no degradation of general test set BLEU, and we show this scheme can be applied to remove gender bias in the output of `black box` online commercial MT systems.

Each component applies the maximum entropy model with abundant lexical and syntax features extracted from the Penn Discourse Tree-bank. The head-based representation of the PDTB is adopted in the arguments identifier, which turns the problem of indentifying the arguments of discourse connective into finding the head and end of the arguments.

{"input": "Deep learning-based language models pretrained on large unannotated text corpora have been demonstrated to allow efficient transfer learning for natural language processing, with recent approaches such as the transformer-based BERT model advancing the state of the art across a variety of tasks. While most work on these models has focused on high-resource languages, in particular English, a number of recent efforts have introduced multilingual models that can be fine-tuned to address tasks in a large number of different languages. However, we still lack a thorough understanding of the capabilities of these models, in particular for lower-resourced languages. In this paper, we focus on Finnish and thoroughly evaluate the multilingual BERT model on a range of tasks, comparing it with a new Finnish BERT model trained from scratch. The new language-specific model is shown to systematically and clearly outperform the multilingual. While the multilingual model largely fails to reach the performance of previously proposed methods, the custom Finnish BERT model establishes new state-of-the-art results on all corpora for all reference tasks: part-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition, and dependency parsing.

{"input": "Deep learning-based language models pretrained on large unannotated text corpora have been demonstrated to allow efficient transfer learning for natural language processing, with recent approaches such as the transformer-based BERT model advancing the state of the art across a variety of tasks. While most work on these models has focused on high-resource languages, in particular English, a number of recent efforts have introduced multilingual models that can be fine-tuned to address tasks in a large number of different languages. However, we still lack a thorough understanding of the capabilities of these models, in particular for lower-resourced languages. In this paper, we focus on Finnish and thoroughly evaluate the multilingual BERT model on a range of tasks, comparing it with a new Finnish BERT model trained from scratch.

{"input": "Emotional language generation is one of the keys to human-like artificial intelligence. Humans use different type of emotions depending on the situation of the conversation. Emotions also play an important role in mediating the engagement level with conversational partners. However, current conversational agents do not effectively account for emotional content in the language generation process. To address this problem, we develop a language modeling approach that generates affective content when the dialogue is situated in a given context. We use the recently released Empathetic-Dialogues corpus to build our models.

{"input": "The rise in popularity and ubiquity of Twitter has made sentiment analysis of tweets an important and well-covered area of research. However, the 140 character limit imposed on tweets makes it hard to use standard linguistic methods for sentiment classification. On the other hand, what tweets lack in structure they make up with sheer volume and rich metadata. This metadata includes geolocation, temporal and author information. We hypothesize that sentiment is dependent on all these contextual factors. Different locations, times and authors have different emotional valences. In this paper, we explored this hypothesis by utilizing distant supervision to collect millions of labelled tweets from different locations, times and authors. We used this data to analyse the variation of tweet sentiments across different authors, times and locations. Once we explored and understood the relationship between these variables and sentiment, we used a Bayesian approach to combine these variables with more standard linguistic features such as n-grams to create a Twitter sentiment classifier. This combined classifier outperforms the purely linguistic classifier, showing that integrating the rich contextual information available on Twitter into sentiment classification is a promising direction of research.\nQuestion: What is the relationship between author and emotional valence?", "output": "people have different baseline emotional valences from one another.

Our method has the same computational complexity as the old method and offers an exact count instead of an approximation.\nQuestion: Could you tell me more about the old method?", "output": "freq(*, word) = freq(word, *) = freq(word). Explanation: Bigram frequencies are often calculated using the approximation\n\n$$freq(*, word) = freq(word, *) = freq(word)$$ (Eq. 1)\n\nIn a much cited paper, Church and Hanks BIBREF0 use ` $=$ ' in place of ` $\\approx $ ' because the approximation is so good. Indeed, this approximation will only cause errors for the very few words which occur near the beginning or the end of the text. Take for example the text appearing above - the bigram (doggies, *) does not occur once, but the approximation says it does.\n\nAn efficient method for computing the contingency matrix for a bigram (word1, word2) is suggested by the approximation. Store $freq(w1, w2)$ for all bigrams $(w1, w2)$ and the frequencies of all words. Then,\n\nThe statistical importance of miscalculations due to this method diminishes as our text grows larger and larger. Interest is growing in the analysis of small texts, however, and a means of computing bigrams for this type of corpus must be employed. This approximation is implemented in popular NLP libraries and can be seen in many tutorials across the internet. People who use this code, or write their own software, must know when it is appropriate."}

{"input": "Text attributes, such as user and product information in product reviews, have been used to improve the performance of sentiment classification models. The de facto standard method is to incorporate them as additional biases in the attention mechanism, and more performance gains are achieved by extending the model architecture. In this paper, we show that the above method is the least effective way to represent and inject attributes. To demonstrate this hypothesis, unlike previous models with complicated architectures, we limit our base model to a simple BiLSTM with attention classifier, and instead focus on how and where the attributes should be incorporated in the model. We propose to represent attributes as chunk-wise importance weight matrices and consider four locations in the model (i.e., embedding, encoding, attention, classifier) to inject attributes. Experiments show that our proposed method achieves significant improvements over the standard approach and that attention mechanism is the worst location to inject attributes, contradicting prior work. We also outperform the state-of-the-art despite our use of a simple base model. Finally, we show that these representations transfer well to other tasks.

Explanation: Specifically, we use a smaller version of our base model (with dimensions set to 64) and incorporate the user and product attributes using nine different approaches: (1) bias-attention: the bias-based method injected to the attention mechanism, (2-5) the matrix-based method injected to four different locations (matrix-embedding, matrix-encoder, matrix-attention, matrix-classifier), and (6-9) the CHIM-based method injected to four different locations (CHIM-embedding, CHIM-encoder, CHIM-attention, CHIM-classifier). We then calculate the accuracy of each approach for all datasets.\n\nResults are shown in Figure FIGREF25. The figure shows that bias-attention consistently performs poorly compared to other approaches. As expected, matrix-based representations perform the worst when injected to embeddings and encoder, however we can already see improvements over bias-attention when these representations are injected to attention and classifier."}
{"input": "An important concern in training multilingual neural machine translation (NMT) is to translate between language pairs unseen during training, i.e zero-shot translation. Improving this ability kills two birds with one stone by providing an alternative to pivot translation which also allows us to better understand how the model captures information between languages. In this work, we carried out an investigation on this capability of the multilingual NMT models. First, we intentionally create an encoder architecture which is independent with respect to the source language. Such experiments shed light on the ability of NMT encoders to learn multilingual representations, in general. Based on such proof of concept, we were able to design regularization methods into the standard Transformer model, so that the whole architecture becomes more robust in zero-shot conditions. We investigated the behaviour of such models on the standard IWSLT 2017 multilingual dataset. We achieved an average improvement of 2.23 BLEU points across 12 language pairs compared to the zero-shot performance of a state-of-the-art multilingual system. Additionally, we carry out further experiments in which the effect is confirmed even for language pairs with multiple intermediate pivots.\nQuestion: What architecture is used in the encoder?", "output": "Transformer. Explanation: By modifying the Transformer architecture of BIBREF10 to afford a fixed-size representation for the encoder output, we found that we can significantly improve zero-shot performance at the cost of a lower performance on the supervised language pairs."}

{"input": "This work attempts to explain the types of computation that neural networks can perform by relating them to automata. We first define what it means for a real-time network with bounded precision to accept a language. A measure of network memory follows from this definition.

We find that LSTMs function like counter machines and relate convolutional networks to the subregular hierarchy.

These theoretical insights help explain neural computation, as well as the relationship between neural networks and natural language grammar.\nQuestion: How do attention, recurrent and convolutional networks differ on the language classes they accept?", "output": "Attention neural networks can represent more languages than other networks. Simple recurring networks can describe regular languages. CNNs can describe only strictly local languages.. Explanation: The exponential state complexity provided by attention enables copying, which we can view as a simplified version of machine translation. Thus, it makes sense that attention is almost universal in machine translation architectures. The additional memory introduced by attention might also allow more complex hierarchical representations."}

{"input": "Recent dialogue approaches operate by reading each word in a conversation history, and aggregating accrued dialogue information into a single state.

In this work, we explore the use of the Neural Turing Machine (NTM) to provide a more permanent and flexible storage mechanism for maintaining dialogue coherence.

{"input": "Producing natural and accurate responses like human beings is the ultimate goal of intelligent dialogue agents. So far, most of the past works concentrate on selecting or generating one pertinent and fluent response according to current query and its context. These models work on a one-to-one environment, making one response to one utterance each round. However, in real human-human conversations, human often sequentially sends several short messages for readability instead of a long message in one turn. Thus messages will not end with an explicit ending signal, which is crucial for agents to decide when to reply. So the first step for an intelligent dialogue agent is not replying but deciding if it should reply at the moment. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose a novel Imagine-then-Arbitrate (ITA) neural dialogue model to help the agent decide whether to wait or to make a response directly. Our method has two imaginator modules and an arbitrator module. The two imaginators will learn the agent's and user's speaking style respectively, generate possible utterances as the input of the arbitrator, combining with dialogue history. And the arbitrator decides whether to wait or to make a response to the user directly.

{"input": "Producing natural and accurate responses like human beings is the ultimate goal of intelligent dialogue agents. So far, most of the past works concentrate on selecting or generating one pertinent and fluent response according to current query and its context. These models work on a one-to-one environment, making one response to one utterance each round. However, in real human-human conversations, human often sequentially sends several short messages for readability instead of a long message in one turn. Thus messages will not end with an explicit ending signal, which is crucial for agents to decide when to reply. So the first step for an intelligent dialogue agent is not replying but deciding if it should reply at the moment. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose a novel Imagine-then-Arbitrate (ITA) neural dialogue model to help the agent decide whether to wait or to make a response directly. Our method has two imaginator modules and an arbitrator module. The two imaginators will learn the agent's and user's speaking style respectively, generate possible utterances as the input of the arbitrator, combining with dialogue history.

{"input": "Recent neural network architectures such as the basic recurrent neural network (RNN) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) have gained prominence as end-to-end learning architectures for natural language processing tasks. But what is the computational power of such systems? We prove that finite precision RNNs with one hidden layer and ReLU activation and finite precision GRUs are exactly as computationally powerful as deterministic finite automata. Allowing arbitrary precision, we prove that RNNs with one hidden layer and ReLU activation are at least as computationally powerful as pushdown automata. If we also allow infinite precision, infinite edge weights, and nonlinear output activation functions, we prove that GRUs are at least as computationally powerful as pushdown automata. All results are shown constructively.\nQuestion: How do they prove that RNNs with arbitrary precision are as powerful as a pushdown automata?", "output": "Theorem 1.11. For any context-free language INLINEFORM0 , suppose we relabel and write INLINEFORM1 for some regular language INLINEFORM2 , whose corresponding minimum-size DFA has INLINEFORM3 states. Then there exists a simple RNN with a hidden layer of size INLINEFORM4 whose INLINEFORM5 -language is INLINEFORM6 .. Explanation: Theorem 1.11. For any context-free language INLINEFORM0 , suppose we relabel and write INLINEFORM1 for some regular language INLINEFORM2 , whose corresponding minimum-size DFA has INLINEFORM3 states. Then there exists a simple RNN with a hidden layer of size INLINEFORM4 whose INLINEFORM5 -language is INLINEFORM6 .\n\nProof. Consider the simple RNN with INLINEFORM0 as its INLINEFORM1 -language described in the proof of Theorem 1.1 and the simple RNN with INLINEFORM2 as its INLINEFORM3 -language constructed to prove Theorem 1.10. Merge the INLINEFORM4 nodes in the input layer corresponding to the input and merge the single output nodes of both RNNs. Stack the two hidden layers, and add no new edges. There were INLINEFORM5 hidden nodes in the first RNN and INLINEFORM6 in the second, so altogether the new RNN has INLINEFORM7 hidden nodes.\n\nThe output of the new RNN is equal to the summed output of the two original RNNs, and from the proofs of Theorems 1.1 and 1.10 these outputs are always nonnegative. Thus the output of the new RNN is INLINEFORM0 if and only if the outputs of both old RNNs were INLINEFORM1 , immediately proving the theorem. INLINEFORM2\n\nDiscussion 1.12. This result shows that simple RNNs with arbitrary precision are at least as computationally powerful as PDAs."}
{"input": "We present here our approach to the GermEval 2019 Task 1 - Shared Task on hierarchical classification of German blurbs. We achieved first place in the hierarchical subtask B and second place on the root node, flat classification subtask A. In subtask A, we applied a simple multi-feature TF-IDF extraction method using different n-gram range and stopword removal, on each feature extraction module. The classifier on top was a standard linear SVM. For the hierarchical classification, we used a local approach, which was more light-weighted but was similar to the one used in subtask A. The key point of our approach was the application of a post-processing to cope with the multi-label aspect of the task, increasing the recall but not surpassing the precision measure score.\nQuestion: What does post-processing do to the output?", "output": "Set treshold  for prediction.. Explanation: Many classifiers can predict a score or confidence about the prediction. Turning this score into the prediction is usually performed by setting a threshold, such as 0 and 0.5, so labels which have a score assigned greater than that are assigned to the sample. This might be not the optimal threshold in the multi-label classification setup and there are many approaches to set it (BIBREF9). Although these methods concentrate in the sample or label, we have had good results with a much more general approach.\n\nAs described in BIBREF1, Read and Pfahringer BIBREF10 introduce a method (referred hereinafter to as LCA) to estimate the threshold globally. Their method chooses the threshold that minimizes the difference between the label cardinality of the training set and the predicted set."}
{"input": "Despite the strong modeling power of neural network acoustic models, speech enhancement has been shown to deliver additional word error rate improvements if multi-channel data is available. However, there has been a longstanding debate whether enhancement should also be carried out on the ASR training data.

Explanation: Test sets: We evaluate the models with two test sets in different domains:\n\nBIO test set: the Cochrane dataset from the WMT 2017 biomedical translation shared task BIBREF20.\n\nNEWS test set: The test set provided in WMT 2015 News Translation Task."}
{"input": "Neural machine translation has recently achieved impressive results, while using little in the way of external linguistic information. In this paper we show that the strong learning capability of neural MT models does not make linguistic features redundant; they can be easily incorporated to provide further improvements in performance. We generalize the embedding layer of the encoder in the attentional encoder--decoder architecture to support the inclusion of arbitrary features, in addition to the baseline word feature. We add morphological features, part-of-speech tags, and syntactic dependency labels as input features to English<->German, and English->Romanian neural machine translation systems. In experiments on WMT16 training and test sets, we find that linguistic input features improve model quality according to three metrics: perplexity, BLEU and CHRF3. An open-source implementation of our neural MT system is available, as are sample files and configurations.\nQuestion: What morphological features are considered?", "output": "case. Explanation: For German INLINEFORM0 English, the parser annotates the German input with morphological features. Different word types have different sets of features \u2013 for instance, nouns have case, number and gender, while verbs have person, number, tense and aspect \u2013 and features may be underspecified."}

Explanation: The weight of each annotation INLINEFORM7 is computed through an alignment model INLINEFORM8 , which models the probability that INLINEFORM9 is aligned to INLINEFORM10 . The alignment model is a single-layer feedforward neural network that is learned jointly with the rest of the network through backpropagation."}
{"input": "We investigate the effects of multi-task learning using the recently introduced task of semantic tagging. We employ semantic tagging as an auxiliary task for three different NLP tasks: part-of-speech tagging, Universal Dependency parsing, and Natural Language Inference. We compare full neural network sharing, partial neural network sharing, and what we term the learning what to share setting where negative transfer between tasks is less likely. Our findings show considerable improvements for all tasks, particularly in the learning what to share setting, which shows consistent gains across all tasks.\nQuestion: What set of semantic tags did they use?", "output": "Tags categories ranging from anaphoric (definite, possessive pronoun), attribute (colour, concrete quantity, intersective, relation), unnamed entity (concept), logical (alternative, disjunction), discourse (subordinate relation), events (present simple, past simple), etc.. Explanation: The semantic tagset is language-neutral, abstracts over part-of-speech and named-entity classes, and includes fine-grained semantic information. The tagset consists of 80 semantic tags grouped in 13 coarse-grained classes. The tagset originated in the Parallel Meaning Bank (PMB) project BIBREF9 , where it contributes to compositional semantics and cross-lingual projection of semantic representations."}

{"input": "In this paper, we focus on a new practical task, document-scale text content manipulation, which is the opposite of text style transfer and aims to preserve text styles while altering the content. In detail, the input is a set of structured records and a reference text for describing another recordset. The output is a summary that accurately describes the partial content in the source recordset with the same writing style of the reference. The task is unsupervised due to lack of parallel data, and is challenging to select suitable records and style words from bi-aspect inputs respectively and generate a high-fidelity long document. To tackle those problems, we first build a dataset based on a basketball game report corpus as our testbed, and present an unsupervised neural model with interactive attention mechanism, which is used for learning the semantic relationship between records and reference texts to achieve better content transfer and better style preservation. In addition, we also explore the effectiveness of the back-translation in our task for constructing some pseudo-training pairs. Empirical results show superiority of our approaches over competitive methods, and the models also yield a new state-of-the-art result on a sentence-level dataset.\nQuestion: How better are results of new model compared to competitive methods?", "output": "For Document- level comparison, the model achieves highest CS precision and  F1 score and it achieves higher BLEU score that TMTE, Coatt, CCDT, and HEDT. \nIn terms of Human Evaluation, the model had the highest average score, the highest Fluency score, and the second highest Content Fidelity. \nIn terms of Sentence-level comparison the model had the highest Recall and F1 scores for Content Fidelity.. Explanation: Document-level text manipulation experimental results are given in Table 2. The first block shows two slot filling methods, which can reach the maximum BLEU (100) after masking out record tokens. It is because that both methods only replace records without modifying other parts of the reference text. Moreover, Copy-SF achieves reasonably good performance on multiple metrics, setting a strong baseline for content fidelity and content selection. For two data-to-text generation methods CCDT and HEDT, the latter one is consistently better than the former, which verifies the proposed hierarchical record encoder is more powerful. However, their Style BLEU scores are particularly low, which demonstrates that direct supervised learning is incapable of controlling the text expression. In comparison, our proposed models achieve better Style BLEU and Content Selection F%. The superior performance of our full model compared to the variant ours-w/o-InterAtt, TMTE and Coatt demonstrates the usefulness of the interactive attention mechanism."}

Explanation: We use the same evaluation metrics employed in BIBREF1. Content Fidelity (CF) is an information extraction (IE) approach used in BIBREF10 to measure model's ability to generate text containing factual records. That is, precision and recall (or number) of unique records extracted from the generated text $z$ via an IE model also appear in source recordset $x$. Style Preservation is used to measure how many stylistic properties of the reference are retained in the generated text. In this paper, we calculate BLEU score between the generated text and the reference to reflect model's ability on style preservation. Furthermore, in order to measure model's ability on content selection, we adopt another IE-based evaluation metric, named Content selection, (CS), which is used for data-to-text generation BIBREF10. It is measured in terms of precision and recall by comparing records in generated text $z$ with records in the auxiliary reference $y_{aux}$."}

Explanation: We compare with the following baseline methods on the document-level text manipulation.\n\n(1) Rule-based Slot Filling Method (Rule-SF) is a straightforward way for text manipulation. Firstly, It masks the record information $x^{\\prime }$ in the $y^{\\prime }$ and build a mapping between $x$ and $x^{\\prime }$ through their data types. Afterwards, select the suitable records from $x$ to fill in the reference y with masked slots. The method is also used in sentence-level task BIBREF1.\n\n(2) Copy-based Slot Filling Method (Copy-SF) is a data-driven slot filling method. It is derived from BIBREF21, which first generates a template text with data slots to be filled and then leverages a delayed copy mechanism to fill in the slots with proper data records.\n\n(3) Conditional Copy based Data-To-Text (CCDT) is a classical neural model for data-to-text generation BIBREF10. (4) Hierarchical Encoder for Data-To-Text (HEDT) is also a data-to-text method, which adopts the same hierarchical encoder in our model.\n\n(5) Text Manipulation with Table Encoder (TMTE) extends sentence-level text editing method BIBREF1 by equipping a more powerful hierarchical table encoder.\n\n(6) Co-attention-based Method (Coatt): a variation of our model by replacing interactive attention with another co-attention model BIBREF22.\n\n(7) Ours w/o Interactive Attention (-InterAtt) is our model without interactive attention.\n\n(8) Ours w/o Back-translation (-BackT) is also a variation of our model by omitting back-translation loss.\n\nIn addition, for sentence-level task, we adopt the same baseline methods as the paper BIBREF1, including an attention-based Seq2Seq method with copy mechanism BIBREF23, a rule-based method, two style transfer methods, MAST BIBREF24 and AdvST BIBREF25, as well as their state-of-the-art method, abbreviate as S-SOTA."}

Explanation: Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a fundamental step for most of the information extraction pipelines. Importantly, the terse and difficult text style of tweets presents serious challenges to NER systems, which are usually trained using more formal text sources such as newswire articles or Wikipedia entries that follow particular morpho-syntactic rules. As a result, off-the-self tools trained on such data perform poorly BIBREF0 . The problem becomes more intense as the number of entities to be identified increases, moving from the traditional setting of very few entities (persons, organization, time, location) to problems with more. Furthermore, most of the resources (e.g., software tools) and benchmarks for NER are for text written in English. As the multilingual content online increases, and English may not be anymore the lingua franca of the Web. Therefore, having resources and benchmarks in other languages is crucial for enabling information access worldwide."}

{"input": "The creation of large-scale open domain reading comprehension data sets in recent years has enabled the development of end-to-end neural comprehension models with promising results. To use these models for domains with limited training data, one of the most effective approach is to first pretrain them on large out-of-domain source data and then fine-tune them with the limited target data. The caveat of this is that after fine-tuning the comprehension models tend to perform poorly in the source domain, a phenomenon known as catastrophic forgetting. In this paper, we explore methods that overcome catastrophic forgetting during fine-tuning without assuming access to data from the source domain. We introduce new auxiliary penalty terms and observe the best performance when a combination of auxiliary penalty terms is used to regularise the fine-tuning process for adapting comprehension models. To test our methods, we develop and release 6 narrow domain data sets that could potentially be used as reading comprehension benchmarks.\nQuestion: What is the training objective in the method introduced in this paper?", "output": "we explore strategies to reduce forgetting for comprehension systems during domain adaption.

{"input": "Recently, recommender systems have been able to emit substantially improved recommendations by leveraging user-provided reviews. Existing methods typically merge all reviews of a given user or item into a long document, and then process user and item documents in the same manner. In practice, however, these two sets of reviews are notably different: users' reviews reflect a variety of items that they have bought and are hence very heterogeneous in their topics, while an item's reviews pertain only to that single item and are thus topically homogeneous. In this work, we develop a novel neural network model that properly accounts for this important difference by means of asymmetric attentive modules. The user module learns to attend to only those signals that are relevant with respect to the target item, whereas the item module learns to extract the most salient contents with regard to properties of the item. Our multi-hierarchical paradigm accounts for the fact that neither are all reviews equally useful, nor are all sentences within each review equally pertinent.

The user module learns to attend to only those signals that are relevant with respect to the target item, whereas the item module learns to extract the most salient contents with regard to properties of the item. Our multi-hierarchical paradigm accounts for the fact that neither are all reviews equally useful, nor are all sentences within each review equally pertinent. Extensive experimental results on a variety of real datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.\nQuestion: Which set of datasets do they use?", "output": "9 Amazon product review datasets for 9 different domains. Explanation: We conducted experiments on 10 different datasets, including 9 Amazon product review datasets for 9 different domains, and the large-scale Yelp challenge dataset on restaurant reviews."}

Collecting labeled data for this task in order to help neural networks generalize better can be laborious and time-consuming. As an alternative, similar data to the real-world examples can be produced artificially through an adversarial process which is carried out in the embedding space. Although these examples are not real sentences, they have been shown to act as a regularization method which can make neural networks more robust.

Explanation: In this work, we utilize a white-box method working on the embedding level. In order to create adversarial examples, we utilize the formula used by BIBREF16, where the perturbations are created using gradient of the loss function. Assuming $p(y|x;\\theta )$ is the probability of label $y$ given the input $x$ and the model parameters $\\theta $, in order to find the adversarial examples the following minimization problem should be solved:\n\nwhere $r$ denotes the perturbations on the input and $\\hat{\\theta }$ is a constant copy of $\\theta $ in order not to allow the gradients to propagate in the process of constructing the artificial examples. Solving the above minimization problem means that we are searching for the worst perturbations while trying to minimize the loss of the model. An approximate solution for Equation DISPLAY_FORM3 is found by linearizing $\\log p(y|x;\\theta )$ around $x$ BIBREF0. Therefore, the following perturbations are added to the input embeddings to create new adversarial sentences in the embedding space."}

{"input": "Open-domain human-computer conversation has attracted much attention in the field of NLP. Contrary to rule- or template-based domain-specific dialog systems, open-domain conversation usually requires data-driven approaches, which can be roughly divided into two categories: retrieval-based and generation-based systems. Retrieval systems search a user-issued utterance (called a query) in a large database, and return a reply that best matches the query. Generative approaches, typically based on recurrent neural networks (RNNs), can synthesize new replies, but they suffer from the problem of generating short, meaningless utterances. In this paper, we propose a novel ensemble of retrieval-based and generation-based dialog systems in the open domain. In our approach, the retrieved candidate, in addition to the original query, is fed to an RNN-based reply generator, so that the neural model is aware of more information. The generated reply is then fed back as a new candidate for post-reranking. Experimental results show that such ensemble outperforms each single part of it by a large margin.\nQuestion: What datasets are used?", "output": "They create their own datasets from online text.. Explanation: To construct a database for information retrieval, we collected human-human utterances from massive online forums, microblogs, and question-answering communities, such as Sina Weibo, Baidu Zhidao, and Baidu Tieba."}
{"input": "Humor is an essential human trait. Efforts to understand humor have called out links between humor and the foundations of cognition, as well as the importance of humor in social engagement. As such, it is a promising and important subject of study, with relevance for artificial intelligence and human-computer interaction. Previous computational work on humor has mostly operated at a coarse level of granularity, e.g., predicting whether an entire sentence, paragraph, document, etc., is humorous. As a step toward deep understanding of humor, we seek fine-grained models of attributes that make a given text humorous. Starting from the observation that satirical news headlines tend to resemble serious news headlines, we build and analyze a corpus of satirical headlines paired with nearly identical but serious headlines. The corpus is constructed via Unfun.me, an online game that incentivizes players to make minimal edits to satirical headlines with the goal of making other players believe the results are serious headlines. The edit operations used to successfully remove humor pinpoint the words and concepts that play a key role in making the original, satirical headline funny. Our analysis reveals that the humor tends to reside toward the end of headlines, and primarily in noun phrases, and that most satirical headlines follow a certain logical pattern, which we term false analogy. Overall, this paper deepens our understanding of the syntactic and semantic structure of satirical news headlines and provides insights for building humor-producing systems.\nQuestion: Where can I access the dataset?", "output": "BIBREF9.

{"input": "Scaling properties of language are a useful tool for understanding generative processes in texts. We investigate the scaling relations in citywise Twitter corpora coming from the Metropolitan and Micropolitan Statistical Areas of the United States. We observe a slightly superlinear urban scaling with the city population for the total volume of the tweets and words created in a city. We then find that a certain core vocabulary follows the scaling relationship of that of the bulk text, but most words are sensitive to city size, exhibiting a super- or a sublinear urban scaling. For both regimes we can offer a plausible explanation based on the meaning of the words. We also show that the parameters for Zipf's law and Heaps law differ on Twitter from that of other texts, and that the exponent of Zipf's law changes with city size.\nQuestion: What explanation do the authors offer for the super or sublinear urban scaling?", "output": "abundance or lack of the elements of urban lifestyle. Explanation: A visible group of words that are amongst the most super- or sublinearly scaling words are related to the abundance or lack of the elements of urban lifestyle (e.g. deer, fitness)."}

{"input": "In this paper, we present a new corpus of entailment problems. This corpus combines the following characteristics: 1. it is precise (does not leave out implicit hypotheses) 2. it is based on\"real-world\"texts (i.e. most of the premises were written for purposes other than testing textual entailment). 3. its size is 150. The corpus was constructed by taking problems from the Real Text Entailment and discovering missing hypotheses using a crowd of experts. We believe that this corpus constitutes a first step towards wide-coverage testing of precise natural-language inference systems.\nQuestion: How were missing hypotheses discovered?", "output": "The problems were then re-rated by experts in logic and/or linguistics.. Explanation: The problems were then re-rated by experts in logic and/or linguistics. For each problem, three experts were consulted, and each expert rated 30 problems. More precisely, the experts were instructed to re-consider each problem and be especially wary of missing hypotheses. If they considered the entailment to hold, we still gave the instruction to optionally mention any additional implicit hypothesis that they would be using."}
{"input": "Open domain response generation has achieved remarkable progress in recent years, but sometimes yields short and uninformative responses. We propose a new paradigm for response generation, that is response generation by editing, which significantly increases the diversity and informativeness of the generation results. Our assumption is that a plausible response can be generated by slightly revising an existing response prototype. The prototype is retrieved from a pre-defined index and provides a good start-point for generation because it is grammatical and informative. We design a response editing model, where an edit vector is formed by considering differences between a prototype context and a current context, and then the edit vector is fed to a decoder to revise the prototype response for the current context. Experiment results on a large scale dataset demonstrate that the response editing model outperforms generative and retrieval-based models on various aspects.\nQuestion: Which aspects of response generation do they evaluate on?", "output": "fluency. Explanation: We evaluate our model on four criteria: fluency, relevance, diversity and originality. We employ Embedding Average (Average), Embedding Extrema (Extrema), and Embedding Greedy (Greedy) BIBREF35 to evaluate response relevance, which are better correlated with human judgment than BLEU."}

{"input": "Self-attention based Transformer has demonstrated the state-of-the-art performances in a number of natural language processing tasks. Self-attention is able to model long-term dependencies, but it may suffer from the extraction of irrelevant information in the context. To tackle the problem, we propose a novel model called \\textbf{Explicit Sparse Transformer}. Explicit Sparse Transformer is able to improve the concentration of attention on the global context through an explicit selection of the most relevant segments. Extensive experimental results on a series of natural language processing and computer vision tasks, including neural machine translation, image captioning, and language modeling, all demonstrate the advantages of Explicit Sparse Transformer in model performance.

For example, the inference speed is twice that of sparsemax in Transformer model.

Explanation: Explicit Sparse Transformer is still based on the Transformer framework. The difference is in the implementation of self-attention. The attention is degenerated to the sparse attention through top-$k$ selection. In this way, the most contributive components for attention are reserved and the other irrelevant information are removed."}

{"input": "Recent powerful pre-trained language models have achieved remarkable performance on most of the popular datasets for reading comprehension. It is time to introduce more challenging datasets to push the development of this field towards more comprehensive reasoning of text. In this paper, we introduce a new Reading Comprehension dataset requiring logical reasoning (ReClor) extracted from standardized graduate admission examinations. As earlier studies suggest, human-annotated datasets usually contain biases, which are often exploited by models to achieve high accuracy without truly understanding the text. In order to comprehensively evaluate the logical reasoning ability of models on ReClor, we propose to identify biased data points and separate them into EASY set while the rest as HARD set. Empirical results show that the state-of-the-art models have an outstanding ability to capture biases contained in the dataset with high accuracy on EASY set.

Explanation: As mentioned earlier, biases prevalently exist in human-annotated datasets BIBREF16, BIBREF17, BIBREF18, BIBREF42, which are often exploited by models to perform well without truly understanding the text. Therefore, it is necessary to find out the biased data points in ReClor in order to evaluate models in a more comprehensive manner BIBREF43. To this end, we feed the five strong baseline models (GPT, GPT-2, BERT$_{\\small \\textsc {BASE}}$, XLNet$_{\\small \\textsc {BASE}}$ and RoBERTa$_{\\small \\textsc {BASE}}$) with ONLY THE ANSWER OPTIONS for each problem. In other words, we purposely remove the context and question in the inputs. In this way, we are able to identify those problems that can be answered correctly by merely exploiting the biases in answer options without knowing the relevant context and question. However, the setting of this task is a multiple-choice question with 4 probable options, and even a chance baseline could have 25% probability to get it right. To eliminate the effect of random guess, we set four different random seeds for each model and pick the data points that are predicted correctly in all four cases to form the EASY set. Then, the data points which are predicted correctly by the models at random could be nearly eliminated, since any data point only has a probability of $(25\\%)^{4}=0.39\\%$ to be guessed right consecutively for four times. Then we unite the sets of data points that are consistently predicted right by each model, because intuitively different models may learn different biases of the dataset."}

In this paper we consider applying knowledge distillation approaches (Bucila et al., 2006; Hinton et al., 2015) that have proven successful for reducing the size of neural models in other domains to the problem of NMT. We demonstrate that standard knowledge distillation applied to word-level prediction can be effective for NMT, and also introduce two novel sequence-level versions of knowledge distillation that further improve performance, and somewhat surprisingly, seem to eliminate the need for beam search (even when applied on the original teacher model).

{"input": "Parkinson's disease patients develop different speech impairments that affect their communication capabilities. The automatic assessment of the speech of the patients allows the development of computer aided tools to support the diagnosis and the evaluation of the disease severity. This paper introduces a methodology to classify Parkinson's disease from speech in three different languages: Spanish, German, and Czech. The proposed approach considers convolutional neural networks trained with time frequency representations and a transfer learning strategy among the three languages. The transfer learning scheme aims to improve the accuracy of the models when the weights of the neural network are initialized with utterances from a different language than the used for the test set. The results suggest that the proposed strategy improves the accuracy of the models in up to 8\\% when the base model used to initialize the weights of the classifier is robust enough. In addition, the results obtained after the transfer learning are in most cases more balanced in terms of specificity-sensitivity than those trained without the transfer learning strategy.\nQuestion: What datasets are used?", "output": "PC-GITA corpus.

{"input": "Automatically verifying rumorous information has become an important and challenging task in natural language processing and social media analytics. Previous studies reveal that people's stances towards rumorous messages can provide indicative clues for identifying the veracity of rumors, and thus determining the stances of public reactions is a crucial preceding step for rumor veracity prediction. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical multi-task learning framework for jointly predicting rumor stance and veracity on Twitter, which consists of two components. The bottom component of our framework classifies the stances of tweets in a conversation discussing a rumor via modeling the structural property based on a novel graph convolutional network. The top component predicts the rumor veracity by exploiting the temporal dynamics of stance evolution. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets show that our method outperforms previous methods in both rumor stance classification and veracity prediction.\nQuestion: How do they split the dataset when training and evaluating their models?", "output": "SemEval-2017 task 8  dataset includes 325 rumorous conversation threads, and has been split into training, development and test sets. \nThe PHEME dataset provides 2,402 conversations covering nine events - in each fold, one event's conversations are used for testing, and all the rest events are used for training.. Explanation: The first is SemEval-2017 task 8 BIBREF16 dataset. It includes 325 rumorous conversation threads, and has been split into training, development and test sets. These threads cover ten events, and two events of that only appear in the test set. This dataset is used to evaluate both stance classification and veracity prediction tasks.\n\nThe second is PHEME dataset BIBREF48. It provides 2,402 conversations covering nine events. Following previous work, we conduct leave-one-event-out cross-validation: in each fold, one event's conversations are used for testing, and all the rest events are used for training. The evaluation metric on this dataset is computed after integrating the outputs of all nine folds. Note that only a subset of this dataset has stance labels, and all conversations in this subset are already contained in SemEval-2017 task 8 dataset.

{"input": "Pre-trained language models such as BERT have proven to be highly effective for natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, the high demand for computing resources in training such models hinders their application in practice. In order to alleviate this resource hunger in large-scale model training, we propose a Patient Knowledge Distillation approach to compress an original large model (teacher) into an equally-effective lightweight shallow network (student). Different from previous knowledge distillation methods, which only use the output from the last layer of the teacher network for distillation, our student model patiently learns from multiple intermediate layers of the teacher model for incremental knowledge extraction, following two strategies: ($i$) PKD-Last: learning from the last $k$ layers; and ($ii$) PKD-Skip: learning from every $k$ layers. These two patient distillation schemes enable the exploitation of rich information in the teacher's hidden layers, and encourage the student model to patiently learn from and imitate the teacher through a multi-layer distillation process. Empirically, this translates into improved results on multiple NLP tasks with significant gain in training efficiency, without sacrificing model accuracy.\nQuestion: What of the two strategies works best?", "output": "PKD-Skip. Explanation: Although both strategies achieved improvement over the vanilla KD baseline (see Table TABREF16), PKD-Skip performs slightly better than PKD-Last."}

The training method is a principled and simple algorithm, where the deletion model obtains its signal directly on-policy from the insertion model output.

The first strategy doesn't change the beam search criterion, but forbids emitting the EOS token unless its probability is within a set range of that of the most probable token. This strategy prevents truncations, but is inefficient against omissions in the middle of the transcript, such as the failure shown in Table TABREF17 . Alternatively, beam search criterion can be extended to promote long transcripts."}
{"input": "The Transformer is widely used in natural language processing tasks. To train a Transformer however, one usually needs a carefully designed learning rate warm-up stage, which is shown to be crucial to the final performance but will slow down the optimization and bring more hyper-parameter tunings. In this paper, we first study theoretically why the learning rate warm-up stage is essential and show that the location of layer normalization matters. Specifically, we prove with mean field theory that at initialization, for the original-designed Post-LN Transformer, which places the layer normalization between the residual blocks, the expected gradients of the parameters near the output layer are large. Therefore, using a large learning rate on those gradients makes the training unstable. The warm-up stage is practically helpful for avoiding this problem. On the other hand, our theory also shows that if the layer normalization is put inside the residual blocks (recently proposed as Pre-LN Transformer), the gradients are well-behaved at initialization. This motivates us to remove the warm-up stage for the training of Pre-LN Transformers. We show in our experiments that Pre-LN Transformers without the warm-up stage can reach comparable results with baselines while requiring significantly less training time and hyper-parameter tuning on a wide range of applications.\nQuestion: How much is training speeded up?", "output": "40% speed-up rate. Explanation: For example, the Post-LN model achieves 1.69 validation loss at 500k updates while the Pre-LN model achieves similar validation loss at 700k updates, which suggests there is a 40% speed-up rate."}

In this work, we introduce a model-driven framework for the automatic annotation of apparent age and gender attributes in large-scale image datasets. Using this framework, we conduct the first demographic audit of the 2012 ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC) subset of ImageNet and the\"person\"hierarchical category of ImageNet.

Focusing on NaturalOWL, a publicly available state of the art natural language generator for OWL ontologies, we propose methods to extract from the Web sentence plans and natural language names, two of the most important types of domain-specific linguistic resources used by the generator. Experiments show that texts generated using linguistic resources extracted by our methods in a semi-automatic manner, with minimal human involvement, are perceived as being almost as good as texts generated using manually authored linguistic resources, and much better than texts produced by using linguistic resources extracted from the relation and entity identifiers of the ontology.\nQuestion: what ontologies did they use?", "output": "Wine Ontology.

{"input": "This paper presents a novel neural model - Dynamic Fusion Network (DFN), for machine reading comprehension (MRC). DFNs differ from most state-of-the-art models in their use of a dynamic multi-strategy attention process, in which passages, questions and answer candidates are jointly fused into attention vectors, along with a dynamic multi-step reasoning module for generating answers. With the use of reinforcement learning, for each input sample that consists of a question, a passage and a list of candidate answers, an instance of DFN with a sample-specific network architecture can be dynamically constructed by determining what attention strategy to apply and how many reasoning steps to take. Experiments show that DFNs achieve the best result reported on RACE, a challenging MRC dataset that contains real human reading questions in a wide variety of types. A detailed empirical analysis also demonstrates that DFNs can produce attention vectors that summarize information from questions, passages and answer candidates more effectively than other popular MRC models.\nQuestion: How much improvement is given on RACE by their introduced approach?", "output": "7.3% on RACE-M and 1.5% on RACE-H.

Previous ablation studies performed against this model attributed the model's performance to certain aspects of its architecture.

Disabling the pruning step drops the accuracy of the model from 43.3% to 36.3%. The large impact on the performance of the KDG model suggests that the pruning may be a useful pre-processing step in training other semantic parsers as well.\nQuestion: what pruning did they perform?", "output": "eliminate spurious training data entries.

Essentially, these methods answers questions such as,\"what is being talked about, regarding X\", and\"what do people feel, regarding X\". In this paper, we investigate another venue for social media monitoring, namely issue ownership and agenda setting, which are concepts from political science that have been used to explain voter choice and electoral outcomes. We argue that issue alignment and agenda setting can be seen as a kind of semantic source similarity of the kind\"how similar is source A to issue owner P, when talking about issue X\", and as such can be measured using word/document embedding techniques. We present work in progress towards measuring that kind of conditioned similarity, and introduce a new notion of similarity for predictive embeddings.

We analyze a large set of manually labeled tweets in different languages, use them as training data, and construct automated classification models. It turns out that the quality of classification models depends much more on the quality and size of training data than on the type of the model trained. Experimental results indicate that there is no statistically significant difference between the performance of the top classification models. We quantify the quality of training data by applying various annotator agreement measures, and identify the weakest points of different datasets. We show that the model performance approaches the inter-annotator agreement when the size of the training set is sufficiently large. However, it is crucial to regularly monitor the self- and inter-annotator agreements since this improves the training datasets and consequently the model performance. Finally, we show that there is strong evidence that humans perceive the sentiment classes (negative, neutral, and positive) as ordered.\nQuestion: What evidence is presented that humans perceive the sentiment classes as ordered?", "output": "average agreement is 18% higher with INLINEFORM7 than with INLINEFORM8. Explanation: First, lets compare the agreements in terms of two variants of INLINEFORM0 : INLINEFORM1 (interval) and INLINEFORM2 (nominal). The difference between the two measures is that INLINEFORM3 assigns four times higher cost to extreme disagreements (between the negative and positive classes) than INLINEFORM4 .

{"input": "Despite the success of attention-based neural models for natural language generation and classification tasks, they are unable to capture the discourse structure of larger documents. We hypothesize that explicit discourse representations have utility for NLP tasks over longer documents or document sequences, which sequence-to-sequence models are unable to capture. For abstractive summarization, for instance, conventional neural models simply match source documents and the summary in a latent space without explicit representation of text structure or relations. In this paper, we propose to use neural discourse representations obtained from a rhetorical structure theory (RST) parser to enhance document representations. Specifically, document representations are generated for discourse spans, known as the elementary discourse units (EDUs). We empirically investigate the benefit of the proposed approach on two different tasks: abstractive summarization and popularity prediction of online petitions.

After that, we designed a model which still keeps an RNN as the encoder, while using a non-autoregressive convolutional decoder.

{"input": "Context plays an important role in human language understanding, thus it may also be useful for machines learning vector representations of language. In this paper, we explore an asymmetric encoder-decoder structure for unsupervised context-based sentence representation learning. We carefully designed experiments to show that neither an autoregressive decoder nor an RNN decoder is required. After that, we designed a model which still keeps an RNN as the encoder, while using a non-autoregressive convolutional decoder. We further combine a suite of effective designs to significantly improve model efficiency while also achieving better performance. Our model is trained on two different large unlabelled corpora, and in both cases the transferability is evaluated on a set of downstream NLP tasks. We empirically show that our model is simple and fast while producing rich sentence representations that excel in downstream tasks.\nQuestion: How long are the two unlabelled corpora?", "output": "Amazon Review dataset BIBREF26 with 142 million sentences, about twice as large as BookCorpus.

Within the Canadian political system, there is gender inequality across all levels of elected government. Online abuse, such as hateful tweets, leveled at women engaged in politics contributes to this inequity, particularly tweets focusing on their gender. In this paper, we present ParityBOT: a Twitter bot which counters abusive tweets aimed at women in politics by sending supportive tweets about influential female leaders and facts about women in public life. ParityBOT is the first artificial intelligence-based intervention aimed at affecting online discourse for women in politics for the better. The goal of this project is to: $1$) raise awareness of issues relating to gender inequity in politics, and $2$) positively influence public discourse in politics. The main contribution of this paper is a scalable model to classify and respond to hateful tweets with quantitative and qualitative assessments. The ParityBOT abusive classification system was validated on public online harassment datasets.

A number of different improvements over basic neural network language models, including importance sampling, word classes, caching and bidirectional recurrent neural network (BiRNN), are studied separately, and the advantages and disadvantages of every technique are evaluated. Then, the limits of neural network language modeling are explored from the aspects of model architecture and knowledge representation. Part of the statistical information from a word sequence will loss when it is processed word by word in a certain order, and the mechanism of training neural network by updating weight matrixes and vectors imposes severe restrictions on any significant enhancement of NNLM.

Explanation: In BIBREF33 , significant improvement on neural machine translation (NMT) for an English to French translation task was achieved by reversing the order of input word sequence, and the possible explanation given for this phenomenon was that smaller \"minimal time lag\" was obtained in this way. In my opinion, another possible explanation is that a word in word sequence may more statistically depend on the following context than previous one."}

{"input": "We analyze the performance of different sentiment classification models on syntactically complex inputs like A-but-B sentences. The first contribution of this analysis addresses reproducible research: to meaningfully compare different models, their accuracies must be averaged over far more random seeds than what has traditionally been reported. With proper averaging in place, we notice that the distillation model described in arXiv:1603.06318v4 [cs.LG], which incorporates explicit logic rules for sentiment classification, is ineffective. In contrast, using contextualized ELMo embeddings (arXiv:1802.05365v2 [cs.CL]) instead of logic rules yields significantly better performance. Additionally, we provide analysis and visualizations that demonstrate ELMo's ability to implicitly learn logic rules. Finally, a crowdsourced analysis reveals how ELMo outperforms baseline models even on sentences with ambiguous sentiment labels.\nQuestion: What logic rules can be learned using ELMo?", "output": "1).But   2).Eng  3).

{"input": "We show that BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) is a Markov random field language model. Formulating BERT in this way gives way to a natural procedure to sample sentence from BERT. We sample sentences from BERT and find that it can produce high-quality, fluent generations. Compared to the generations of a traditional left-to-right language model, BERT generates sentences that are more diverse but of slightly worse quality.\nQuestion: Which metrics are used for evaluating the quality?", "output": "BLEU. Explanation: We follow BIBREF18 by computing BLEU BIBREF19 between the generations and the original data distributions to measure how similar the generations are. We use a random sample of 5000 sentences from the test set of WikiText-103 BIBREF20 and a random sample of 5000 sentences from TBC as references.\r\n\r\nWe also evaluate the perplexity of a trained language model on the generations as a rough proxy for fluency. Specifically, we use the Gated Convolutional Language Model BIBREF21 pretrained on WikiText-103.\r\n\r\nFollowing BIBREF22 , we compute self-BLEU: for each generated sentence, we compute BLEU treating the rest of the sentences as references, and average across sentences. Self-BLEU measures how similar each generated sentence is to the other generations; high self-BLEU indicates that the model has low sample diversity.\r\n\r\nWe also evaluate the percentage of $n$ -grams that are unique, when compared to the original data distribution and within the corpus of generations. We note that this metric is somewhat in opposition to BLEU between generations and data, as fewer unique $n$ -grams implies higher BLEU."}
{"input": "This paper describes a system that generates speaker-annotated transcripts of meetings by using a microphone array and a 360-degree camera. The hallmark of the system is its ability to handle overlapped speech, which has been an unsolved problem in realistic settings for over a decade. We show that this problem can be addressed by using a continuous speech separation approach. In addition, we describe an online audio-visual speaker diarization method that leverages face tracking and identification, sound source localization, speaker identification, and, if available, prior speaker information for robustness to various real world challenges. All components are integrated in a meeting transcription framework called SRD, which stands for \"separate, recognize, and diarize\". Experimental results using recordings of natural meetings involving up to 11 attendees are reported. The continuous speech separation improves a word error rate (WER) by 16.1% compared with a highly tuned beamformer. When a complete list of meeting attendees is available, the discrepancy between WER and speaker-attributed WER is only 1.0%, indicating accurate word-to-speaker association. This increases marginally to 1.6% when 50% of the attendees are unknown to the system.\nQuestion: Are face tracking, identification, localization etc multimodal inputs in some ML model or system is programmed by hand?", "output": "Face tracking is performed in an automatic tracklet module, face identification is performed by creating a face embedding from the output of a CNN, the embedding is then compared to a gallery of each person's face using a discriminative classifier (SVM) and localization is modelled with a complex angular central Gaussian model. All are merged in a statistical model.. Explanation: The unconstrained meeting scenario involves many challenges, including face occlusions, extreme head pose, lighting conditions, compression artifacts, low resolution due to device-to-person distances, motion blur. Therefore, any individual frame may not contain necessary information. For example, a face may not be detectable in some frames. Even if it is detectable, it may not be recognizable.\n\nTo handle this variability, we integrate information across time using face tracking as implied by our formulation of $P(h | r, V)$, which requires face identification to be performed only at a tracklet level. Our face tracking uses face detection and low-level tracking to maintain a set of tracklets, where each tracklet is defined as a sequence of faces in time that belong to the same person. We use a method similar to that in BIBREF50 with several adaptions to our specific setting, such as exploiting the stationarity of the camera for detecting motion, performing the low-level tracking by color based mean-shift instead of gray-level based normalized correlation, tuning the algorithm to minimize the risk of tracklet mergers (which in our context are destructive), etc. Also, the faces in each tracklet are augmented with attributes such as face position, dimensions, head pose, and face feature vectors. The tracklet set defines $\\mathcal {R}$ of equation (DISPLAY_FORM7)."}

Overton's vision is to shift developers to these higher-level tasks instead of lower-level machine learning tasks. In fact, using Overton, engineers can build deep-learning-based applications without writing any code in frameworks like TensorFlow. For over a year, Overton has been used in production to support multiple applications in both near-real-time applications and back-of-house processing.

Explanation: The labels are tagged by the source that produced them: these labels may be incomplete and even contradictory. Overton models the sources of these labels, which may come human annotators, or from engineer-defined heuristics such as data augmentation or heuristic labelers. Overton learns the accuracy of these sources using ideas from the Snorkel project BIBREF1. In particular, it estimates the accuracy of these sources and then uses these accuracies to compute a probability that each training point is correct BIBREF9. Overton incorporates this information into the loss function for a task; this also allows Overton to automatically handle common issues like rebalancing classes."}

In that time, Overton-based applications have answered billions of queries in multiple languages and processed trillions of records reducing errors 1.7-2.9 times versus production systems.\nQuestion: How are applications presented in Overton?", "output": "Applications are customized by providing supervision in a data file that conforms to the schema. Explanation: The schema is changed infrequently, and many engineers who use Overton simply select an existing schema. Applications are customized by providing supervision in a data file that conforms to the schema, described next."}

But it must also, as the human reader must, aggregate numerous individual value hypotheses into a single coherent global analysis, applying global constraints which reflect prior knowledge of the domain. In this work we focus on the task of extracting plane crash event information from clusters of related news articles whose labels are derived via distant supervision. Unlike previous machine reading work, we assume that while most target values will occur frequently in most clusters, they may also be missing or incorrect. We introduce a novel neural architecture to explicitly model the noisy nature of the data and to deal with these aforementioned learning issues. Our models are trained end-to-end and achieve an improvement of more than 12.1 F$_1$ over previous work, despite using far less linguistic annotation. We apply factor graph constraints to promote more coherent event analyses, with belief propagation inference formulated within the transitions of a recurrent neural network.

{"input": "This paper describes CAiRE's submission to the unsupervised machine translation track of the WMT'19 news shared task from German to Czech. We leverage a phrase-based statistical machine translation (PBSMT) model and a pre-trained language model to combine word-level neural machine translation (NMT) and subword-level NMT models without using any parallel data. We propose to solve the morphological richness problem of languages by training byte-pair encoding (BPE) embeddings for German and Czech separately, and they are aligned using MUSE (Conneau et al., 2018). To ensure the fluency and consistency of translations, a rescoring mechanism is proposed that reuses the pre-trained language model to select the translation candidates generated through beam search. Moreover, a series of pre-processing and post-processing approaches are applied to improve the quality of final translations.\nQuestion: How is the quality of the translation evaluated?", "output": "They report the scores of several evaluation methods for every step of their approach..

{"input": "There is a growing interest in creating tools to assist in clinical note generation using the audio of provider-patient encounters. Motivated by this goal and with the help of providers and medical scribes, we developed an annotation scheme to extract relevant clinical concepts. We used this annotation scheme to label a corpus of about 6k clinical encounters. This was used to train a state-of-the-art tagging model. We report ontologies, labeling results, model performances, and detailed analyses of the results. Our results show that the entities related to medications can be extracted with a relatively high accuracy of 0.90 F-score, followed by symptoms at 0.72 F-score, and conditions at 0.57 F-score. In our task, we not only identify where the symptoms are mentioned but also map them to canonical forms as they appear in the clinical notes. Of the different types of errors, in about 19-38% of the cases, we find that the model output was correct, and about 17-32% of the errors do not impact the clinical note. Taken together, the models developed in this work are more useful than the F-scores reflect, making it a promising approach for practical applications.\nQuestion: What state-of-the-art tagging model did they use?", "output": "the Span-Attribute Tagging (SAT) model. Explanation: One of the challenges for model development in this task is the limited amount of training data. To use the data efficiently, we developed the Span-Attribute Tagging (SAT) model which performs inference in a hierarchical manner by identifying the clinically relevant span using a BIO scheme and classifying the spans into specific labels BIBREF19. The span is represented using the latent representation from a bidirectional encoder, and as such has the capacity to capture the relevant context information. This latent contextual representation is used to infer the entity label and the status of the symptom as experienced or not. This is a trainable mechanism to infer status in contrast to ad hoc methods applied in negation tasks in previous work in clinical domain BIBREF20."}
{"input": "In this paper, we present a deep reinforcement learning (RL) framework for iterative dialog policy optimization in end-to-end task-oriented dialog systems. Popular approaches in learning dialog policy with RL include letting a dialog agent to learn against a user simulator. Building a reliable user simulator, however, is not trivial, often as difficult as building a good dialog agent. We address this challenge by jointly optimizing the dialog agent and the user simulator with deep RL by simulating dialogs between the two agents. We first bootstrap a basic dialog agent and a basic user simulator by learning directly from dialog corpora with supervised training. We then improve them further by letting the two agents to conduct task-oriented dialogs and iteratively optimizing their policies with deep RL. Both the dialog agent and the user simulator are designed with neural network models that can be trained end-to-end.

{"input": "With the exponential growth in the usage of social media to share live updates about life, taking pictures has become an unavoidable phenomenon. Individuals unknowingly create a unique knowledge base with these images. The food images, in particular, are of interest as they contain a plethora of information. From the image metadata and using computer vision tools, we can extract distinct insights for each user to build a personal profile. Using the underlying connection between cuisines and their inherent tastes, we attempt to develop such a profile for an individual based solely on the images of his food. Our study provides insights about an individual's inclination towards particular cuisines. Interpreting these insights can lead to the development of a more precise recommendation system. Such a system would avoid the generic approach in favor of a personalized recommendation system.\nQuestion: Is this done in form of unsupervised (clustering) or suppervised learning?", "output": "Supervised methods are used to identify the dish and ingredients in the image, and an unsupervised method (KNN) is used to create the food profile.. Explanation: METHODOLOGY\nThe real task lies in converting the image into interpretable data that can be parsed and used. To help with this, a data processing pipeline is built. The details of the pipeline are discussed below. The data pipeline extensively uses the ClarifaiBIBREF8 image recognition model. The 3 models used extensively are:\n\nThe General Model : It recognizes over 11,000 different concepts and is a great all purpose solution. We have used this model to distinguish between Food images and Non-Food images.\n\nThe Food Model : It recognizes more than 1,000 food items in images down to the ingredient level. This model is used to identify the ingredients in a food image.\n\nThe General Embedding Model : It analyzes images and returns numerical vectors that represent the input images in a 1024-dimensional space. The vector representation is computed by using Clarifai\u2019s \u2018General\u2019 model. The vectors of visually similar images will be close to each other in the 1024-dimensional space. This is used to eliminate multiple similar images of the same food item."}
{"input": "In recent years, neural machine translation (NMT) has become the dominant approach in automated translation. However, like many other deep learning approaches, NMT suffers from overfitting when the amount of training data is limited. This is a serious issue for low-resource language pairs and many specialized translation domains that are inherently limited in the amount of available supervised data. For this reason, in this paper we propose regressing word (ReWE) and sentence (ReSE) embeddings at training time as a way to regularize NMT models and improve their generalization. During training, our models are trained to jointly predict categorical (words in the vocabulary) and continuous (word and sentence embeddings) outputs. An extensive set of experiments over four language pairs of variable training set size has showed that ReWE and ReSE can outperform strong state-of-the-art baseline models, with an improvement that is larger for smaller training sets (e.g., up to +5:15 BLEU points in Basque-English translation). Visualizations of the decoder's output space show that the proposed regularizers improve the clustering of unique words, facilitating correct predictions. In a final experiment on unsupervised NMT, we show that ReWE and ReSE are also able to improve the quality of machine translation when no parallel data are available.\nQuestion: What baselines do they compare to?", "output": "a encoder-decoder architecture with attention incorporating LSTMs and transformers.

Construction of sentiment classifiers is a standard text mining task, but here we address the question of how to properly evaluate them as there is no settled way to do so. Sentiment classes are ordered and unbalanced, and Twitter produces a stream of time-ordered data. The problem we address concerns the procedures used to obtain reliable estimates of performance measures, and whether the temporal ordering of the training and test data matters. We collected a large set of 1.5 million tweets in 13 European languages. We created 138 sentiment models and out-of-sample datasets, which are used as a gold standard for evaluations. The corresponding 138 in-sample datasets are used to empirically compare six different estimation procedures: three variants of cross-validation, and three variants of sequential validation (where test set always follows the training set). We find no significant difference between the best cross-validation and sequential validation. However, we observe that all cross-validation variants tend to overestimate the performance, while the sequential methods tend to underestimate it. Standard cross-validation with random selection of examples is significantly worse than the blocked cross-validation, and should not be used to evaluate classifiers in time-ordered data scenarios.\nQuestion: In what way are sentiment classes ordered?", "output": "time-ordered. Explanation: The complexity of Twitter data raises some challenges on how to perform such estimations, as, to the best of our knowledge, there is currently no settled approach to this. Sentiment classes are typically ordered and unbalanced, and the data itself is time-ordered. Taking these properties into account is important for the selection of appropriate estimation procedures."}
