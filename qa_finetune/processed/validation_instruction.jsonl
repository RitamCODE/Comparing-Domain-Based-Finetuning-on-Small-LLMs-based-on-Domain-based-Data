{"input": "Transfer learning between different language pairs has shown its effectiveness for Neural Machine Translation (NMT) in low-resource scenario. However, existing transfer methods involving a common target language are far from success in the extreme scenario of zero-shot translation, due to the language space mismatch problem between transferor (the parent model) and transferee (the child model) on the source side. To address this challenge, we propose an effective transfer learning approach based on cross-lingual pre-training. Our key idea is to make all source languages share the same feature space and thus enable a smooth transition for zero-shot translation. To this end, we introduce one monolingual pre-training method and two bilingual pre-training methods to obtain a universal encoder for different languages. Once the universal encoder is constructed, the parent model built on such encoder is trained with large-scale annotated data and then directly applied in zero-shot translation scenario.

Evaluations demonstrated that summaries produced by the tuned model achieved higher ROUGE scores compared to model trained on just student reflection data or just newspaper data. The tuned model also achieved higher scores compared to extractive summarization baselines, and additionally was judged to produce more coherent and readable summaries in human evaluations. Second, we explored whether synthesizing summaries of student data could additionally boost performance.

Explanation: . While automated evaluation metrics like ROUGE measure lexical similarity between machine and human summaries, humans can better measure how coherent and readable a summary is. Our evaluation study investigates whether tuning the PG-net model increases summary coherence, by asking evaluators to select which of three summaries for the same document they like most: the PG-net model trained on CNN/DM; the model trained on student reflections; and finally the model trained on CNN/DM and tuned on student reflections. 20 evaluators were recruited from our institution and asked to each perform 20 annotations. Summaries are presented to evaluators in random order. Evaluators are then asked to select the summary they feel to be most readable and coherent."}
{"input": "Training abstractive summarization models typically requires large amounts of data, which can be a limitation for many domains. In this paper we explore using domain transfer and data synthesis to improve the performance of recent abstractive summarization methods when applied to small corpora of student reflections. First, we explored whether tuning state of the art model trained on newspaper data could boost performance on student reflection data. Evaluations demonstrated that summaries produced by the tuned model achieved higher ROUGE scores compared to model trained on just student reflection data or just newspaper data. The tuned model also achieved higher scores compared to extractive summarization baselines, and additionally was judged to produce more coherent and readable summaries in human evaluations. Second, we explored whether synthesizing summaries of student data could additionally boost performance. We proposed a template-based model to synthesize new data, which when incorporated into training further increased ROUGE scores. Finally, we showed that combining data synthesis with domain transfer achieved higher ROUGE scores compared to only using one of the two approaches.\nQuestion: What is the recent abstractive summarization method in this paper?", "output": "pointer networks with coverage mechanism (PG-net).

{"input": "Pre-trained deep neural network language models such as ELMo, GPT, BERT and XLNet have recently achieved state-of-the-art performance on a variety of language understanding tasks. However, their size makes them impractical for a number of scenarios, especially on mobile and edge devices. In particular, the input word embedding matrix accounts for a significant proportion of the model's memory footprint, due to the large input vocabulary and embedding dimensions. Knowledge distillation techniques have had success at compressing large neural network models, but they are ineffective at yielding student models with vocabularies different from the original teacher models. We introduce a novel knowledge distillation technique for training a student model with a significantly smaller vocabulary as well as lower embedding and hidden state dimensions. Specifically, we employ a dual-training mechanism that trains the teacher and student models simultaneously to obtain optimal word embeddings for the student vocabulary. We combine this approach with learning shared projection matrices that transfer layer-wise knowledge from the teacher model to the student model. Our method is able to compress the BERT_BASE model by more than 60x, with only a minor drop in downstream task metrics, resulting in a language model with a footprint of under 7MB. Experimental results also demonstrate higher compression efficiency and accuracy when compared with other state-of-the-art compression techniques.\nQuestion: Why are prior knowledge distillation techniques models are ineffective in producing student models with vocabularies different from the original teacher models?", "output": "While there has been existing work on reducing NLP model vocabulary sizes BIBREF15, distillation techniques cannot utilize these, since they require the student and teacher models to share the same vocabulary and output space. This profoundly limits their potential to further reduce model sizes.. Explanation: However, a significant bottleneck that has been overlooked by previous efforts is the input vocabulary size and its corresponding word embedding matrix, often accounting for a significant proportion of all model parameters. For instance, the embedding table of the BERTBASE model, comprising over 30K WordPiece tokens BIBREF14, accounts for over $21\\%$ of the model size. While there has been existing work on reducing NLP model vocabulary sizes BIBREF15, distillation techniques cannot utilize these, since they require the student and teacher models to share the same vocabulary and output space. This profoundly limits their potential to further reduce model sizes."}

The annotation of this dataset is designed so that successfully answering the questions requires understanding and the knowledge involved in a document. We implement a framework consisting of both a question answering model and a question generation model, both of which take the knowledge extracted from the document as well as relevant facts from an external knowledge base such as Freebase/ProBase/Reverb/NELL.

It does not very well adapt to cases when there is no similarity between two sequences or if the relationship is contrastive.

{"input": "Attention is a very efficient way to model the relationship between two sequences by comparing how similar two intermediate representations are. Initially demonstrated in NMT, it is a standard in all NLU tasks today when efficient interaction between sequences is considered. However, we show that attention, by virtue of its composition, works best only when it is given that there is a match somewhere between two sequences. It does not very well adapt to cases when there is no similarity between two sequences or if the relationship is contrastive.

{"input": "Open-domain question answering (QA) is known to involve several underlying knowledge and reasoning challenges, but are models actually learning such knowledge when trained on benchmark tasks? To investigate this, we introduce several new challenge tasks that probe whether state-of-the-art QA models have general knowledge about word definitions and general taxonomic reasoning, both of which are fundamental to more complex forms of reasoning and are widespread in benchmark datasets. As an alternative to expensive crowd-sourcing, we introduce a methodology for automatically building datasets from various types of expert knowledge (e.g., knowledge graphs and lexical taxonomies), allowing for systematic control over the resulting probes and for a more comprehensive evaluation. We find automatically constructing probes to be vulnerable to annotation artifacts, which we carefully control for. Our evaluation confirms that transformer-based QA models are already predisposed to recognize certain types of structural lexical knowledge. However, it also reveals a more nuanced picture: their performance degrades substantially with even a slight increase in the number of hops in the underlying taxonomic hierarchy, or as more challenging distractor candidate answers are introduced. Further, even when these models succeed at the standard instance-level evaluation, they leave much room for improvement when assessed at the level of clusters of semantically connected probes (e.g., all Isa questions about a concept).\nQuestion: Do they focus on Reading Comprehension or multiple choice question answering?", "output": "MULTIPLE CHOICE QUESTION ANSWERING. Explanation: In the multiple-choice setting, which is the variety of question-answering (QA) that we focus on in this paper, there is also pragmatic reasoning involved in selecting optimal answer choices (e.g., while greenhouse effect might in some other context be a reasonable answer to the second question in Figure FIGREF1, global warming is a preferable candidate)."}

{"input": "We present our experience in applying distributional semantics (neural word embeddings) to the problem of representing and clustering documents in a bilingual comparable corpus. Our data is a collection of Russian and Ukrainian academic texts, for which topics are their academic fields. In order to build language-independent semantic representations of these documents, we train neural distributional models on monolingual corpora and learn the optimal linear transformation of vectors from one language to another. The resulting vectors are then used to produce `semantic fingerprints' of documents, serving as input to a clustering algorithm. The presented method is compared to several baselines including `orthographic translation' with Levenshtein edit distance and outperforms them by a large margin. We also show that language-independent `semantic fingerprints' are superior to multi-lingual clustering algorithms proposed in the previous work, at the same time requiring less linguistic resources.\nQuestion: What evaluation metric do they use?", "output": "Accuracy.

Explanation: We compare with the following baselines:\n\n(1) Naive: A non-domain-adaptive baseline with bag-of-words representations and SVM classifier trained on the source domain.\n\n(2) mSDA BIBREF7 : This is the state-of-the-art method based on discrete input features. Top 1000 bag-of-words features are kept as pivot features. We set the number of stacked layers to 3 and the corruption probability to 0.5.\n\n(3) NaiveNN: This is a non-domain-adaptive CNN trained on source domain, which is a variant of our model by setting INLINEFORM0 , INLINEFORM1 , and INLINEFORM2 to zeros.\n\n(4) AuxNN BIBREF4 : This is a neural model that exploits auxiliary tasks, which has achieved state-of-the-art results on cross-domain sentiment classification. The sentence encoder used in this model is the same as ours.\n\n(5) ADAN BIBREF16 : This method exploits adversarial training to reduce representation difference between domains. The original paper uses a simple feedforward network as encoder. For fair comparison, we replace it with our CNN-based encoder. We train 5 iterations on the discriminator per iteration on the encoder and sentiment classifier as suggested in their paper.\n\n(6) MMD: MMD has been widely used for minimizing domain discrepancy on images. In those works BIBREF9 , BIBREF13 , variants of deep CNNs are used for encoding images and the MMDs of multiple layers are jointly minimized. In NLP, adding more layers of CNNs may not be very helpful and thus those models from image-related tasks can not be directly applied to our problem. To compare with MMD-based method, we train a model that jointly minimize the classification loss INLINEFORM0 on the source domain and MMD between INLINEFORM1 and INLINEFORM2 . For computing MMD, we use a Gaussian RBF which is a common choice for characteristic kernel."}

{"input": "In this paper, the problem of disambiguating a target word for Polish is approached by searching for related words with known meaning. These relatives are used to build a training corpus from unannotated text. This technique is improved by proposing new rich sources of replacements that substitute the traditional requirement of monosemy with heuristics based on wordnet relations. The na\\\"ive Bayesian classifier has been modified to account for an unknown distribution of senses. A corpus of 600 million web documents (594 billion tokens), gathered by the NEKST search engine allows us to assess the relationship between training set size and disambiguation accuracy. The classifier is evaluated using both a wordnet baseline and a corpus with 17,314 manually annotated occurrences of 54 ambiguous words.\nQuestion: How do they deal with unknown distribution senses?", "output": "The N\u00e4ive-Bayes classifier is corrected so it is not biased to most frequent classes. Explanation: Secondly, a well-known problem of uneven yet unknown distribution of word senses is alleviated by modifying a na\u00efve Bayesian classifier. Thanks to this correction, the classifier is no longer biased towards senses that have more training data."}
{"input": "Online propaganda is central to the recruitment strategies of extremist groups and in recent years these efforts have increasingly extended to women. To investigate ISIS' approach to targeting women in their online propaganda and uncover implications for counterterrorism, we rely on text mining and natural language processing (NLP).

To identify similarities or differences between these texts and those produced by non-violent religious groups, we extend the analysis to articles from a Catholic forum dedicated to women. We also perform an emotional analysis of both of these resources to better understand the emotional components of propaganda. We rely on Depechemood (a lexical-base emotion analysis method) to detect emotions most likely to be evoked in readers of these materials.

Explanation: Comparing these topics with those that appeared on a Catholic women forum, it seems that both ISIS and non-violent groups use topics about motherhood, spousal relationship, and marriage/divorce when they address women. Moreover, we used Depechemood methods to analyze the emotions that these materials are likely to elicit in readers. The result of our emotion analysis suggests that both corpuses used words that aim to inspire readers while avoiding fear. However, the actual words that lead to these effects are very different in the two contexts. Overall, our findings indicate that, using proper methods, automated analysis of large bodies of textual data can provide novel insight insight into extremist propaganda that can assist the counterterrorism community."}

Existing evaluation metrics focus on surface similarity between a candidate caption and a set of reference captions, and do not check the actual relation between a caption and the underlying visual content.

The main difference between the two models is the way they condition the decoder. The Show&Tell model feeds the image embedding as the \u201cpredecessor word embedding\u201d to the first produced word, while the LRCN1u model concatenates the image features with the embedded previous word as the input to the sequence model at each time step."}

This motivates us to carry out a backward greedy search over each sentence's label sequence to identify word boundaries. If two words segmented in a sentence are identified as nouns, and one word is immediately before the other, we assemble their boundaries, creating a new word candidate for entity recognition.

Automatic identification of causal explanations in social media, while challenging in relying on contextual and sequential cues, offers a larger-scale alternative to expensive manual ratings and opens the door for new applications (e.g. studying prevailing beliefs about causes, such as climate change). Here, we explore automating causal explanation analysis, building on discourse parsing, and presenting two novel subtasks: causality detection (determining whether a causal explanation exists at all) and causal explanation identification (identifying the specific phrase that is the explanation). We achieve strong accuracies for both tasks but find different approaches best: an SVM for causality prediction (F1 = 0.791) and a hierarchy of Bidirectional LSTMs for causal explanation identification (F1 = 0.853).

{"input": "Many NLP tasks such as tagging and machine reading comprehension are faced with the severe data imbalance issue: negative examples significantly outnumber positive examples, and the huge number of background examples (or easy-negative examples) overwhelms the training. The most commonly used cross entropy (CE) criteria is actually an accuracy-oriented objective, and thus creates a discrepancy between training and test: at training time, each training instance contributes equally to the objective function, while at test time F1 score concerns more about positive examples. In this paper, we propose to use dice loss in replacement of the standard cross-entropy objective for data-imbalanced NLP tasks. Dice loss is based on the Sorensen-Dice coefficient or Tversky index, which attaches similar importance to false positives and false negatives, and is more immune to the data-imbalance issue. To further alleviate the dominating influence from easy-negative examples in training, we propose to associate training examples with dynamically adjusted weights to deemphasize easy-negative examples.Theoretical analysis shows that this strategy narrows down the gap between the F1 score in evaluation and the dice loss in training. With the proposed training objective, we observe significant performance boost on a wide range of data imbalanced NLP tasks.

The intuition of changing $p_{i1}$ to $(1-p_{i1}) p_{i1}$ is to push down the weight of easy examples. For easy examples whose probability are approaching 0 or 1, $(1-p_{i1}) p_{i1}$ makes the model attach significantly less focus to them. Figure FIGREF23 gives gives an explanation from the perspective in derivative: the derivative of $\\frac{(1-p)p}{1+(1-p)p}$ with respect to $p$ approaches 0 immediately after $p$ approaches 0, which means the model attends less to examples once they are correctly classified.. Explanation: Comparing Eq.DISPLAY_FORM14 with Eq.DISPLAY_FORM22, we can see that Eq.DISPLAY_FORM14 is actually a soft form of $F1$, using a continuous $p$ rather than the binary $\\mathbb {I}( p_{i1}>0.5)$. This gap isn't a big issue for balanced datasets, but is extremely detrimental if a big proportion of training examples are easy-negative ones: easy-negative examples can easily dominate training since their probabilities can be pushed to 0 fairly easily. Meanwhile, the model can hardly distinguish between hard-negative examples and positive ones, which has a huge negative effect on the final F1 performance.\n\nTo address this issue, we propose to multiply the soft probability $p$ with a decaying factor $(1-p)$, changing Eq.DISPLAY_FORM22 to the following form:\n\nOne can think $(1-p_{i1})$ as a weight associated with each example, which changes as training proceeds.

Focal loss was proposed for one-stage object detector to handle foreground-background tradeoff encountered during training. It down-weights the loss assigned to well-classified examples by adding a $(1-p)^{\\beta }$ factor, leading the final loss to be $(1-p)^{\\beta }\\log p$."}

{"input": "We present the shared task on Fine-Grained Propaganda Detection, which was organized as part of the NLP4IF workshop at EMNLP-IJCNLP 2019. There were two subtasks. FLC is a fragment-level task that asks for the identification of propagandist text fragments in a news article and also for the prediction of the specific propaganda technique used in each such fragment (18-way classification task). SLC is a sentence-level binary classification task asking to detect the sentences that contain propaganda. A total of 12 teams submitted systems for the FLC task, 25 teams did so for the SLC task, and 14 teams eventually submitted a system description paper. For both subtasks, most systems managed to beat the baseline by a sizable margin. The leaderboard and the data from the competition are available at this http URL.\nQuestion: What are the 18 propaganda techniques?", "output": "Loaded language. Explanation: We refer the reader to BIBREF10 for more details on the propaganda techniques; below we report the list of techniques:\n\nPropaganda Techniques ::: 1. Loaded language.\nUsing words/phrases with strong emotional implications (positive or negative) to influence an audience BIBREF11.\n\nPropaganda Techniques ::: 2. Name calling or labeling.\nLabeling the object of the propaganda as something the target audience fears, hates, finds undesirable or otherwise loves or praises BIBREF12.\n\nPropaganda Techniques ::: 3. Repetition.\nRepeating the same message over and over again, so that the audience will eventually accept it BIBREF13, BIBREF12.\n\nPropaganda Techniques ::: 4. Exaggeration or minimization.\nEither representing something in an excessive manner: making things larger, better, worse, or making something seem less important or smaller than it actually is BIBREF14, e.g., saying that an insult was just a joke.\n\nPropaganda Techniques ::: 5. Doubt.\nQuestioning the credibility of someone or something.\n\nPropaganda Techniques ::: 6. Appeal to fear/prejudice.\nSeeking to build support for an idea by instilling anxiety and/or panic in the population towards an alternative, possibly based on preconceived judgments.\n\nPropaganda Techniques ::: 7. Flag-waving.\nPlaying on strong national feeling (or with respect to a group, e.g., race, gender, political preference) to justify or promote an action or idea BIBREF15.\n\nPropaganda Techniques ::: 8. Causal oversimplification.\nAssuming one cause when there are multiple causes behind an issue. We include scapegoating as well: the transfer of the blame to one person or group of people without investigating the complexities of an issue.\n\nPropaganda Techniques ::: 9. Slogans.\nA brief and striking phrase that may include labeling and stereotyping. Slogans tend to act as emotional appeals BIBREF16.\n\nPropaganda Techniques ::: 10. Appeal to authority.\nStating that a claim is true simply because a valid authority/expert on the issue supports it, without any other supporting evidence BIBREF17. We include the special case where the reference is not an authority/expert, although it is referred to as testimonial in the literature BIBREF14.\n\nPropaganda Techniques ::: 11. Black-and-white fallacy, dictatorship.\nPresenting two alternative options as the only possibilities, when in fact more possibilities exist BIBREF13. As an extreme case, telling the audience exactly what actions to take, eliminating any other possible choice (dictatorship).\n\nPropaganda Techniques ::: 12. Thought-terminating clich\u00e9.\nWords or phrases that discourage critical thought and meaningful discussion about a given topic. They are typically short and generic sentences that offer seemingly simple answers to complex questions or that distract attention away from other lines of thought BIBREF18.\n\nPropaganda Techniques ::: 13. Whataboutism.\nDiscredit an opponent's position by charging them with hypocrisy without directly disproving their argument BIBREF19.\n\nPropaganda Techniques ::: 14. Reductio ad Hitlerum.\nPersuading an audience to disapprove an action or idea by suggesting that the idea is popular with groups hated in contempt by the target audience. It can refer to any person or concept with a negative connotation BIBREF20.\n\nPropaganda Techniques ::: 15. Red herring.\nIntroducing irrelevant material to the issue being discussed, so that everyone's attention is diverted away from the points made BIBREF11. Those subjected to a red herring argument are led away from the issue that had been the focus of the discussion and urged to follow an observation or claim that may be associated with the original claim, but is not highly relevant to the issue in dispute BIBREF20.\n\nPropaganda Techniques ::: 16. Bandwagon.\nAttempting to persuade the target audience to join in and take the course of action because \u201ceveryone else is taking the same action\u201d BIBREF15.\n\nPropaganda Techniques ::: 17. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness, confusion.\nUsing deliberately unclear words, to let the audience have its own interpretation BIBREF21, BIBREF11. For instance, when an unclear phrase with multiple possible meanings is used within the argument and, therefore, it does not really support the conclusion.\n\nPropaganda Techniques ::: 18. Straw man.\nWhen an opponent's proposition is substituted with a similar one which is then refuted in place of the original BIBREF22."}

{"input": "The advent of the attention mechanism in neural machine translation models has improved the performance of machine translation systems by enabling selective lookup into the source sentence. In this paper, the efficiencies of translation using bidirectional encoder attention decoder models were studied with respect to translation involving morphologically rich languages. The English - Tamil language pair was selected for this analysis. First, the use of Word2Vec embedding for both the English and Tamil words improved the translation results by 0.73 BLEU points over the baseline RNNSearch model with 4.84 BLEU score. The use of morphological segmentation before word vectorization to split the morphologically rich Tamil words into their respective morphemes before the translation, caused a reduction in the target vocabulary size by a factor of 8. Also, this model (RNNMorph) improved the performance of neural machine translation by 7.05 BLEU points over the RNNSearch model used over the same corpus. Since the BLEU evaluation of the RNNMorph model might be unreliable due to an increase in the number of matching tokens per sentence, the performances of the translations were also compared by means of human evaluation metrics of adequacy, fluency and relative ranking. Further, the use of morphological segmentation also improved the efficacy of the attention mechanism.\nQuestion: How were the human judgements assembled?", "output": "50 human annotators ranked a random sample of 100 translations by Adequacy, Fluency and overall ranking on a 5-point scale.. Explanation: A group of 50 native people who were well-versed in both English and Tamil languages acted as annotators for the evaluation. A collection of samples of about 100 sentences were taken from the test set results for comparison. This set included a randomized selection of the translation results to ensure the objectivity of evaluation. Fluency and adequacy results for the RNNMorph results are tabulated. Adequacy rating was calculated on a 5-point scale of how much of the meaning is conveyed by the translation (All, Most, Much, Little, None). The fluency rating was calculated based on grammatical correctness on a 5-point scale of (Flawless, Good, Non-native, Disfluent, Incomprehensive). For the comparison process, the RNNMorph and the RNNSearch + Word2Vec models\u2019 sentence level translations were individually ranked between each other, permitting the two translations to have ties in the ranking."}

We used the same techniques here, as described above.\n\nFor the best quality speech synthesis we need a few hours of phonetically-balanced, single-speaker, read speech. Our first step was to use the start and end points for each turn in the dialogues, and select those of the most frequent speaker, nmlch. This gave us around 18250 segments. We further automatically removed excessive silence from the start, middle and end of these turns (based on occurrence of F0). This gave us 13 hours and 48 minutes of speech.\n\nWe phonetically aligned this data and built a speech clustergen statistical speech synthesizer BIBREF9 from all of this data."}

Yet better performances are obtained with our feature-based models on lexically richer datasets (e.g. for morphologically rich languages), whereas neural-based results are higher on datasets with less lexical variability (e.g. for English). These conclusions hold in particular for the MEMM models relying on our system MElt, which benefited from newly designed features. This shows that, under certain conditions, feature-based approaches enriched with morphosyntactic lexicons are competitive with respect to neural methods.\nQuestion: which datasets did they experiment with?", "output": "Universal Dependencies v1.2 treebanks for the following 16 languages: Bulgarian, Croatian, Czech, Danish, English, French, German,\nIndonesian, Italian, Norwegian, Persian, Polish, Portuguese, Slovenian, Spanish, and Swedish.

{"input": "This paper contributes to an emerging literature that models votes and text in tandem to better understand polarization of expressed preferences. It introduces a new approach to estimate preference polarization in multidimensional settings, such as international relations, based on developments in the natural language processing and network science literatures -- namely word embeddings, which retain valuable syntactical qualities of human language, and community detection in multilayer networks, which locates densely connected actors across multiple, complex networks. We find that the employment of these tools in tandem helps to better estimate states' foreign policy preferences expressed in UN votes and speeches beyond that permitted by votes alone. The utility of these located affinity blocs is demonstrated through an application to conflict onset in International Relations, though these tools will be of interest to all scholars faced with the measurement of preferences and polarization in multidimensional settings.\nQuestion: Which dataset do they use?", "output": "corpus of state speeches delivered during the annual UN General Debate.

We quantify the extent to which a given short text is characteristic of a specific person, using a dataset of tweets from fifteen celebrities. Such analysis is useful for generating excerpts of high-volume Twitter profiles, and understanding how representativeness relates to tweet popularity. We first consider the related task of binary author detection (is x the author of text T?), and report a test accuracy of 90.37% for the best of five approaches to this problem. We then use these models to compute characterization scores among all of an author's texts. A user study shows human evaluators agree with our characterization model for all 15 celebrities in our dataset, each with p-value < 0.05. We use these classifiers to show surprisingly strong correlations between characterization scores and the popularity of the associated texts. Indeed, we demonstrate a statistically significant correlation between this score and tweet popularity (likes/replies/retweets) for 13 of the 15 celebrities in our study.\nQuestion: What kind of celebrities do they obtain tweets from?", "output": "Amitabh Bachchan, Ariana Grande, Barack Obama, Bill Gates, Donald Trump,\nEllen DeGeneres, J K Rowling, Jimmy Fallon, Justin Bieber, Kevin Durant, Kim Kardashian, Lady Gaga, LeBron James,Narendra Modi, Oprah Winfrey.

{"input": "Pretrained language models have achieved remarkable improvements in a broad range of natural language processing tasks, including question answering (QA). To analyze pretrained language model performance on QA, we extend the LAMA (Petroni et al., 2019) evaluation framework by a component that is focused on negation. We find that pretrained language models are equally prone to generate facts (\"birds can fly\") and their negation (\"birds cannot fly\"). This casts doubt on the claim that pretrained language models have adequately learned factual knowledge.\nQuestion: How did they extend LAMA evaluation framework to focus on negation?", "output": "To this end, we introduce the negated LAMA dataset. We construct it by simply inserting negation elements (e.g., \u201cnot\u201d) in LAMA cloze statement.

A PA process involves purposeful multi-step multi-modal communication between employees, their supervisors and their peers, such as self-appraisal, supervisor assessment and peer feedback. Analysis of the structured data and text produced in PA is crucial for measuring the quality of appraisals and tracking actual improvements.

Next we use multi-class multi-label classification techniques to match supervisor assessments to predefined broad perspectives on performance. Finally, we propose a short-text summarization technique to produce a summary of peer feedback comments for a given employee and compare it with manual summaries.

{"input": "Machine Reading Comprehension (MRC) is the task of answering a question over a paragraph of text. While neural MRC systems gain popularity and achieve noticeable performance, issues are being raised with the methodology used to establish their performance, particularly concerning the data design of gold standards that are used to evaluate them. There is but a limited understanding of the challenges present in this data, which makes it hard to draw comparisons and formulate reliable hypotheses. As a first step towards alleviating the problem, this paper proposes a unifying framework to systematically investigate the present linguistic features, required reasoning and background knowledge and factual correctness on one hand, and the presence of lexical cues as a lower bound for the requirement of understanding on the other hand. We propose a qualitative annotation schema for the first and a set of approximative metrics for the latter. In a first application of the framework, we analyse modern MRC gold standards and present our findings: the absence of features that contribute towards lexical ambiguity, the varying factual correctness of the expected answers and the presence of lexical cues, all of which potentially lower the reading comprehension complexity and quality of the evaluation data.\nQuestion: What features are absent from MRC gold standards that can result in potential lexical ambiguity?", "output": "Restrictivity. Explanation: We recognise features that add ambiguity to the supporting facts, for example when information is only expressed implicitly by using an Ellipsis. As opposed to redundant words, we annotate Restrictivity and Factivity modifiers, words and phrases whose presence does change the meaning of a sentence with regard to the expected answer, and occurrences of intra- or inter-sentence Coreference in supporting facts (that is relevant to the question). Lastly, we mark ambiguous syntactic features, when their resolution is required in order to obtain the answer. Concretely, we mark argument collection with con- and disjunctions (Listing) and ambiguous Prepositions, Coordination Scope and Relative clauses/Adverbial phrases/Appositions."}

Conventional approaches employ multi-task learning and pre-training methods for this task, but they suffer from the huge gap between pre-training and fine-tuning. To address these issues, we propose a Tandem Connectionist Encoding Network (TCEN) which bridges the gap by reusing all subnets in fine-tuning, keeping the roles of subnets consistent, and pre-training the attention module. Furthermore, we propose two simple but effective methods to guarantee the speech encoder outputs and the MT encoder inputs are consistent in terms of semantic representation and sequence length. Experimental results show that our model outperforms baselines 2.2 BLEU on a large benchmark dataset.\nQuestion: What are the baselines?", "output": "Vanilla ST baseline. Explanation: Vanilla ST baseline: The vanilla ST BIBREF9 has only a speech encoder and a decoder. It is trained from scratch on the ST-TED corpus.\n\nPre-training baselines: We conduct three pre-training baseline experiments: 1) encoder pre-training, in which the ST encoder is initialized from an ASR model; 2) decoder pre-training, in which the ST decoder is initialized from an MT model; and 3) encoder-decoder pre-training, where both the encoder and decoder are pre-trained. The ASR model has the same architecture with vanilla ST model, trained on the mixture of ST-TED and TED-LIUM2 corpus. The MT model has a text encoder and decoder with the same architecture of which in TCEN. It is first trained on WMT data (out-of-domain) and then fine-tuned on in-domain data.\n\nMulti-task baselines: We also conduct three multi-task baseline experiments including one-to-many setting, many-to-one setting, and many-to-many setting. In the first two settings, we train the model with $\\alpha _{st}=0.75$ while $\\alpha _{asr}=0.25$ or $\\alpha _{mt}=0.25$. For many-to-many setting, we use $\\alpha _{st}=0.6, \\alpha _{asr}=0.2$ and $\\alpha _{mt}=0.2$.. For MT task, we use only in-domain data.\n\nMany-to-many+pre-training: We train a many-to-many multi-task model where the encoders and decoders are derived from pre-trained ASR and MT models. Triangle+pre-train: BIBREF18 DBLP:conf/naacl/AnastasopoulosC18 proposed a triangle multi-task strategy for speech translation. Their model solves the subnet waste issue by concatenating an ST decoder to an ASR encoder-decoder model. Notably, their ST decoder can consume representations from the speech encoder as well as the ASR decoder. For a fair comparison, the speech encoder and the ASR decoder are initialized from the pre-trained ASR model. The Triangle model is fine-tuned under their multi-task manner."}

{"input": "In this work, we propose contextual language models that incorporate dialog level discourse information into language modeling. Previous works on contextual language model treat preceding utterances as a sequence of inputs, without considering dialog interactions. We design recurrent neural network (RNN) based contextual language models that specially track the interactions between speakers in a dialog. Experiment results on Switchboard Dialog Act Corpus show that the proposed model outperforms conventional single turn based RNN language model by 3.3% on perplexity. The proposed models also demonstrate advantageous performance over other competitive contextual language models.\nQuestion: How long of dialog history is captured?", "output": "two previous turns. Explanation: A dialog turn from one speaker may not only be a direct response to the other speaker's query, but also likely to be a continuation of his own previous statement. Thus, when modeling turn $k$ in a dialog, we propose to connect the last RNN state of turn $k-2$ directly to the starting RNN state of turn $k$ , instead of letting it to propagate through the RNN for turn $k-1$ ."}

However, wrong combination of hyper-parameters can produce poor quality vectors. The objective of this work is to show optimal combination of hyper-parameters exists and evaluate various combinations. We compare them with the original model released by Mikolov. Both intrinsic and extrinsic (downstream) evaluations, including Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Sentiment Analysis (SA) were carried out. The downstream tasks reveal that the best model is task-specific, high analogy scores don't necessarily correlate positively with F1 scores and the same applies for more data. Increasing vector dimension size after a point leads to poor quality or performance. If ethical considerations to save time, energy and the environment are made, then reasonably smaller corpora may do just as well or even better in some cases. Besides, using a small corpus, we obtain better human-assigned WordSim scores, corresponding Spearman correlation and better downstream (NER&SA) performance compared to Mikolov's model, trained on 100 billion word corpus.\nQuestion: What sentiment analysis dataset is used?", "output": "IMDb dataset of movie reviews.

{"input": "Although Seq2Seq models for table-to-text generation have achieved remarkable progress, modeling table representation in one dimension is inadequate. This is because (1) the table consists of multiple rows and columns, which means that encoding a table should not depend only on one dimensional sequence or set of records and (2) most of the tables are time series data (e.g. NBA game data, stock market data), which means that the description of the current table may be affected by its historical data. To address aforementioned problems, not only do we model each table cell considering other records in the same row, we also enrich table's representation by modeling each table cell in context of other cells in the same column or with historical (time dimension) data respectively. In addition, we develop a table cell fusion gate to combine representations from row, column and time dimension into one dense vector according to the saliency of each dimension's representation. We evaluated our methods on ROTOWIRE, a benchmark dataset of NBA basketball games.

{"input": "Offensive behaviour has become pervasive in the Internet community. Individuals take the advantage of anonymity in the cyber world and indulge in offensive communications which they may not consider in the real life. Governments, online communities, companies etc are investing into prevention of offensive behaviour content in social media. One of the most effective solution for tacking this enigmatic problem is the use of computational techniques to identify offensive content and take action. The current work focuses on detecting offensive language in English tweets. The dataset used for the experiment is obtained from SemEval-2019 Task 6 on Identifying and Categorizing Offensive Language in Social Media (OffensEval). The dataset contains 14,460 annotated English tweets. The present paper provides a comparative analysis and Random kitchen sink (RKS) based approach for offensive language detection. We explore the effectiveness of Google sentence encoder, Fasttext, Dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) based features and Random kitchen sink (RKS) method for offensive language detection. From the experiments and evaluation we observed that RKS with fastetxt achieved competing results. The evaluation measures used are accuracy, precision, recall, f1-score.\nQuestion: What is the Random Kitchen Sink approach?", "output": "Random Kitchen Sink method uses a kernel function to map data vectors to a space where linear separation is possible..

{"input": "The utility of Twitter data as a medium to support population-level mental health monitoring is not well understood. In an effort to better understand the predictive power of supervised machine learning classifiers and the influence of feature sets for efficiently classifying depression-related tweets on a large-scale, we conducted two feature study experiments. In the first experiment, we assessed the contribution of feature groups such as lexical information (e.g., unigrams) and emotions (e.g., strongly negative) using a feature ablation study. In the second experiment, we determined the percentile of top ranked features that produced the optimal classification performance by applying a three-step feature elimination approach. In the first experiment, we observed that lexical features are critical for identifying depressive symptoms, specifically for depressed mood (-35 points) and for disturbed sleep (-43 points). In the second experiment, we observed that the optimal F1-score performance of top ranked features in percentiles variably ranged across classes e.g., fatigue or loss of energy (5th percentile, 288 features) to depressed mood (55th percentile, 3,168 features) suggesting there is no consistent count of features for predicting depressive-related tweets. We conclude that simple lexical features and reduced feature sets can produce comparable results to larger feature sets.\nQuestion: What are the three steps to feature elimination?", "output": "Reduction. Explanation: We conducted an experiment to determine whether we could maintain or improve classifier performances by applying the following three-tiered feature elimination approach:\n\nReduction We reduced the dataset encoded for each class by eliminating features that occur less than twice in the full dataset.\n\nSelection We iteratively applied Chi-Square feature selection on the reduced dataset, selecting the top percentile of highest ranked features in increments of 5 percent to train and test the support vector model using a linear kernel and 5-fold, stratified cross-validation.\n\nRank We cumulatively plotted the average F1-score performances of each incrementally added percentile of top ranked features. We report the percentile and count of features resulting in the first occurrence of the highest average F1-score for each class."}

{"input": "Electronic Healthcare records contain large volumes of unstructured data in different forms. Free text constitutes a large portion of such data, yet this source of richly detailed information often remains under-used in practice because of a lack of suitable methodologies to extract interpretable content in a timely manner. Here we apply network-theoretical tools to the analysis of free text in Hospital Patient Incident reports in the English National Health Service, to find clusters of reports in an unsupervised manner and at different levels of resolution based directly on the free text descriptions contained within them. To do so, we combine recently developed deep neural network text-embedding methodologies based on paragraph vectors with multi-scale Markov Stability community detection applied to a similarity graph of documents obtained from sparsified text vector similarities. We showcase the approach with the analysis of incident reports submitted in Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, London. The multiscale community structure reveals levels of meaning with different resolution in the topics of the dataset, as shown by relevant descriptive terms extracted from the groups of records, as well as by comparing a posteriori against hand-coded categories assigned by healthcare personnel. Our content communities exhibit good correspondence with well-defined hand-coded categories, yet our results also provide further medical detail in certain areas as well as revealing complementary descriptors of incidents beyond the external classification. We also discuss how the method can be used to monitor reports over time and across different healthcare providers, and to detect emerging trends that fall outside of pre-existing categories.\nQuestion: Which text embedding methodologies are used?", "output": "Document to Vector (Doc2Vec). Explanation: We then train a paragraph vector model using the Document to Vector (Doc2Vec) framework BIBREF7 on the whole set (13 million) of preprocessed text records, although training on smaller sets (1 million) also produces good results."}
{"input": "Automatic machine learning systems can inadvertently accentuate and perpetuate inappropriate human biases. Past work on examining inappropriate biases has largely focused on just individual systems. Further, there is no benchmark dataset for examining inappropriate biases in systems. Here for the first time, we present the Equity Evaluation Corpus (EEC), which consists of 8,640 English sentences carefully chosen to tease out biases towards certain races and genders. We use the dataset to examine 219 automatic sentiment analysis systems that took part in a recent shared task, SemEval-2018 Task 1 'Affect in Tweets'. We find that several of the systems show statistically significant bias; that is, they consistently provide slightly higher sentiment intensity predictions for one race or one gender. We make the EEC freely available.\nQuestion: Which race and gender are given higher sentiment intensity predictions?", "output": "Females are given higher sentiment intensity when predicting anger, joy or valence, but males are given higher sentiment intensity when predicting  fear.\nAfrican American names are given higher score on the tasks of anger, fear, and sadness intensity prediction,  but European American names are given higher scores on joy and valence task.. Explanation: When predicting anger, joy, or valence, the number of systems consistently giving higher scores to sentences with female noun phrases (21\u201325) is markedly higher than the number of systems giving higher scores to sentences with male noun phrases (8\u201313). (Recall that higher valence means more positive sentiment.) In contrast, on the fear task, most submissions tended to assign higher scores to sentences with male noun phrases (23) as compared to the number of systems giving higher scores to sentences with female noun phrases (12). When predicting sadness, the number of submissions that mostly assigned higher scores to sentences with female noun phrases (18) is close to the number of submissions that mostly assigned higher scores to sentences with male noun phrases (16). These results are in line with some common stereotypes, such as females are more emotional, and situations involving male agents are more fearful BIBREF27"}

{"input": "Understanding passenger intents from spoken interactions and car's vision (both inside and outside the vehicle) are important building blocks towards developing contextual dialog systems for natural interactions in autonomous vehicles (AV). In this study, we continued exploring AMIE (Automated-vehicle Multimodal In-cabin Experience), the in-cabin agent responsible for handling certain multimodal passenger-vehicle interactions. When the passengers give instructions to AMIE, the agent should parse such commands properly considering available three modalities (language/text, audio, video) and trigger the appropriate functionality of the AV system. We had collected a multimodal in-cabin dataset with multi-turn dialogues between the passengers and AMIE using a Wizard-of-Oz scheme via realistic scavenger hunt game. In our previous explorations, we experimented with various RNN-based models to detect utterance-level intents (set destination, change route, go faster, go slower, stop, park, pull over, drop off, open door, and others) along with intent keywords and relevant slots (location, position/direction, object, gesture/gaze, time-guidance, person) associated with the action to be performed in our AV scenarios. In this recent work, we propose to discuss the benefits of multimodal understanding of in-cabin utterances by incorporating verbal/language input (text and speech embeddings) together with the non-verbal/acoustic and visual input from inside and outside the vehicle (i.e., passenger gestures and gaze from in-cabin video stream, referred objects outside of the vehicle from the road view camera stream). Our experimental results outperformed text-only baselines and with multimodality, we achieved improved performances for utterance-level intent detection and slot filling.\nQuestion: By how much is performance improved with multimodality?", "output": "by 2.3-6.8 points in f1 score for intent recognition and 0.8-3.5 for slot filling.

{"input": "The ability of semantic reasoning over the sentence pair is essential for many natural language understanding tasks, e.g., natural language inference and machine reading comprehension. A recent significant improvement in these tasks comes from BERT. As reported, the next sentence prediction (NSP) in BERT, which learns the contextual relationship between two sentences, is of great significance for downstream problems with sentence-pair input. Despite the effectiveness of NSP, we suggest that NSP still lacks the essential signal to distinguish between entailment and shallow correlation. To remedy this, we propose to augment the NSP task to a 3-class categorization task, which includes a category for previous sentence prediction (PSP). The involvement of PSP encourages the model to focus on the informative semantics to determine the sentence order, thereby improves the ability of semantic understanding. This simple modification yields remarkable improvement against vanilla BERT. To further incorporate the document-level information, the scope of NSP and PSP is expanded into a broader range, i.e., NSP and PSP also include close but nonsuccessive sentences, the noise of which is mitigated by the label-smoothing technique. Both qualitative and quantitative experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Our method consistently improves the performance on the NLI and MRC benchmarks, including the challenging HANS dataset~\\cite{hans}, suggesting that the document-level task is still promising for the pre-training.\nQuestion: How much is performance improved on NLI?", "output": "improvement on the RTE dataset is significant, i.e., 4% absolute gain over the BERTBase.

{"input": "When using active learning, smaller batch sizes are typically more efficient from a learning efficiency perspective. However, in practice due to speed and human annotator considerations, the use of larger batch sizes is necessary. While past work has shown that larger batch sizes decrease learning efficiency from a learning curve perspective, it remains an open question how batch size impacts methods for stopping active learning. We find that large batch sizes degrade the performance of a leading stopping method over and above the degradation that results from reduced learning efficiency. We analyze this degradation and find that it can be mitigated by changing the window size parameter of how many past iterations of learning are taken into account when making the stopping decision.

{"input": "This paper proposes a novel multilingual multistage fine-tuning approach for low-resource neural machine translation (NMT), taking a challenging Japanese--Russian pair for benchmarking. Although there are many solutions for low-resource scenarios, such as multilingual NMT and back-translation, we have empirically confirmed their limited success when restricted to in-domain data. We therefore propose to exploit out-of-domain data through transfer learning, by using it to first train a multilingual NMT model followed by multistage fine-tuning on in-domain parallel and back-translated pseudo-parallel data. Our approach, which combines domain adaptation, multilingualism, and back-translation, helps improve the translation quality by more than 3.7 BLEU points, over a strong baseline, for this extremely low-resource scenario.\nQuestion: what was the baseline?", "output": "pivot-based translation relying on a helping language BIBREF10.

{"input": "Sentiment analysis aims to uncover emotions conveyed through information. In its simplest form, it is performed on a polarity basis, where the goal is to classify information with positive or negative emotion. Recent research has explored more nuanced ways to capture emotions that go beyond polarity. For these methods to work, they require a critical resource: a lexicon that is appropriate for the task at hand, in terms of the range of emotions it captures diversity. In the past, sentiment analysis lexicons have been created by experts, such as linguists and behavioural scientists, with strict rules. Lexicon evaluation was also performed by experts or gold standards. In our paper, we propose a crowdsourcing method for lexicon acquisition, which is scalable, cost-effective, and doesn't require experts or gold standards.

We demonstrate that normative data from multiple speech-based tasks helps improve AD detection by up to 9%. Visualization of decision boundaries reveals that models trained on a combination of structured picture descriptions and unstructured conversational speech have the least out-of-task error and show the most potential to generalize to multiple tasks.

{"input": "A major proportion of a text summary includes important entities found in the original text. These entities build up the topic of the summary. Moreover, they hold commonsense information once they are linked to a knowledge base. Based on these observations, this paper investigates the usage of linked entities to guide the decoder of a neural text summarizer to generate concise and better summaries. To this end, we leverage on an off-the-shelf entity linking system (ELS) to extract linked entities and propose Entity2Topic (E2T), a module easily attachable to a sequence-to-sequence model that transforms a list of entities into a vector representation of the topic of the summary. Current available ELS's are still not sufficiently effective, possibly introducing unresolved ambiguities and irrelevant entities. We resolve the imperfections of the ELS by (a) encoding entities with selective disambiguation, and (b) pooling entity vectors using firm attention. By applying E2T to a simple sequence-to-sequence model with attention mechanism as base model, we see significant improvements of the performance in the Gigaword (sentence to title) and CNN (long document to multi-sentence highlights) summarization datasets by at least 2 ROUGE points.\nQuestion: Why are current ELS's not sufficiently effective?", "output": "Linked entities may be ambiguous or too common.

{"input": "In the era of social media and networking platforms, Twitter has been doomed for abuse and harassment toward users specifically women. Monitoring the contents including sexism and sexual harassment in traditional media is easier than monitoring on the online social media platforms like Twitter, because of the large amount of user generated content in these media. So, the research about the automated detection of content containing sexual or racist harassment is an important issue and could be the basis for removing that content or flagging it for human evaluation. Previous studies have been focused on collecting data about sexism and racism in very broad terms. However, there is not much study focusing on different types of online harassment alone attracting natural language processing techniques. In this work, we present an attention-based approach for the detection of harassment in tweets and the detection of different types of harassment as well.

{"input": "Most neural network models for document classification on social media focus on text infor-mation to the neglect of other information on these platforms. In this paper, we classify post stance on social media channels and develop UTCNN, a neural network model that incorporates user tastes, topic tastes, and user comments on posts. UTCNN not only works on social media texts, but also analyzes texts in forums and message boards. Experiments performed on Chinese Facebook data and English online debate forum data show that UTCNN achieves a 0.755 macro-average f-score for supportive, neutral, and unsupportive stance classes on Facebook data, which is significantly better than models in which either user, topic, or comment information is withheld. This model design greatly mitigates the lack of data for the minor class without the use of oversampling. In addition, UTCNN yields a 0.842 accuracy on English online debate forum data, which also significantly outperforms results from previous work as well as other deep learning models, showing that UTCNN performs well regardless of language or platform.\nQuestion: What topic is covered in the Chinese Facebook data?", "output": "anti-nuclear-power.

Explanation: Figure FIGREF10 illustrates the UTCNN model. As more than one user may interact with a given post, we first add a maximum pooling layer after the user matrix embedding layer and user vector embedding layer to form a moderator matrix embedding INLINEFORM0 and a moderator vector embedding INLINEFORM1 for moderator INLINEFORM2 respectively, where INLINEFORM3 is used for the semantic transformation in the document composition process, as mentioned in the previous section. The term moderator here is to denote the pseudo user who provides the overall semantic/sentiment of all the engaged users for one document. The embedding INLINEFORM4 models the moderator stance preference, that is, the pattern of the revealed user stance: whether a user is willing to show his preference, whether a user likes to show impartiality with neutral statements and reasonable arguments, or just wants to show strong support for one stance. Ideally, the latent user stance is modeled by INLINEFORM5 for each user. Likewise, for topic information, a maximum pooling layer is added after the topic matrix embedding layer and topic vector embedding layer to form a joint topic matrix embedding INLINEFORM6 and a joint topic vector embedding INLINEFORM7 for topic INLINEFORM8 respectively, where INLINEFORM9 models the semantic transformation of topic INLINEFORM10 as in users and INLINEFORM11 models the topic stance tendency. The latent topic stance is also modeled by INLINEFORM12 for each topic.\n\nAs for comments, we view them as short documents with authors only but without likers nor their own comments. Therefore we apply document composition on comments although here users are commenters (users who comment). It is noticed that the word embeddings INLINEFORM0 for the same word in the posts and comments are the same, but after being transformed to INLINEFORM1 in the document composition process shown in Figure FIGREF4 , they might become different because of their different engaged users. The output comment representation together with the commenter vector embedding INLINEFORM2 and topic vector embedding INLINEFORM3 are concatenated and a maximum pooling layer is added to select the most important feature for comments. Instead of requiring that the comment stance agree with the post, UTCNN simply extracts the most important features of the comment contents; they could be helpful, whether they show obvious agreement or disagreement. Therefore when combining comment information here, the maximum pooling layer is more appropriate than other pooling or merging layers. Indeed, we believe this is one reason for UTCNN's performance gains.\n\nFinally, the pooled comment representation, together with user vector embedding INLINEFORM0 , topic vector embedding INLINEFORM1 , and document representation are fed to a fully connected network, and softmax is applied to yield the final stance label prediction for the post."}

Explanation: Model\nSBERT adds a pooling operation to the output of BERT / RoBERTa to derive a fixed sized sentence embedding. We experiment with three pooling strategies: Using the output of the CLS-token, computing the mean of all output vectors (MEAN-strategy), and computing a max-over-time of the output vectors (MAX-strategy). The default configuration is MEAN.\n\nIn order to fine-tune BERT / RoBERTa, we create siamese and triplet networks BIBREF15 to update the weights such that the produced sentence embeddings are semantically meaningful and can be compared with cosine-similarity.\n\nThe network structure depends on the available training data. We experiment with the following structures and objective functions.\n\nClassification Objective Function. We concatenate the sentence embeddings $u$ and $v$ with the element-wise difference $|u-v|$ and multiply it with the trainable weight $W_t \\in \\mathbb {R}^{3n \\times k}$:\n\nwhere $n$ is the dimension of the sentence embeddings and $k$ the number of labels. We optimize cross-entropy loss. This structure is depicted in Figure FIGREF4.\n\nRegression Objective Function. The cosine-similarity between the two sentence embeddings $u$ and $v$ is computed (Figure FIGREF5). We use mean-squared-error loss as the objective function.\n\nTriplet Objective Function. Given an anchor sentence $a$, a positive sentence $p$, and a negative sentence $n$, triplet loss tunes the network such that the distance between $a$ and $p$ is smaller than the distance between $a$ and $n$. Mathematically, we minimize the following loss function:\n\nwith $s_x$ the sentence embedding for $a$/$n$/$p$, $||\\cdot ||$ a distance metric and margin $\\epsilon $. Margin $\\epsilon $ ensures that $s_p$ is at least $\\epsilon $ closer to $s_a$ than $s_n$. As metric we use Euclidean distance and we set $\\epsilon =1$ in our experiments."}

{"input": "Microblogging platforms such as Twitter are increasingly being used in event detection. Existing approaches mainly use machine learning models and rely on event-related keywords to collect the data for model training. These approaches make strong assumptions on the distribution of the relevant micro-posts containing the keyword -- referred to as the expectation of the distribution -- and use it as a posterior regularization parameter during model training. Such approaches are, however, limited as they fail to reliably estimate the informativeness of a keyword and its expectation for model training. This paper introduces a Human-AI loop approach to jointly discover informative keywords for model training while estimating their expectation. Our approach iteratively leverages the crowd to estimate both keyword specific expectation and the disagreement between the crowd and the model in order to discover new keywords that are most beneficial for model training. These keywords and their expectation not only improve the resulting performance but also make the model training process more transparent. We empirically demonstrate the merits of our approach, both in terms of accuracy and interpretability, on multiple real-world datasets and show that our approach improves the state of the art by 24.3%.\nQuestion: What type of classifiers are used?", "output": "probabilistic model.

This paper introduces a Human-AI loop approach to jointly discover informative keywords for model training while estimating their expectation. Our approach iteratively leverages the crowd to estimate both keyword specific expectation and the disagreement between the crowd and the model in order to discover new keywords that are most beneficial for model training. These keywords and their expectation not only improve the resulting performance but also make the model training process more transparent. We empirically demonstrate the merits of our approach, both in terms of accuracy and interpretability, on multiple real-world datasets and show that our approach improves the state of the art by 24.3%.\nQuestion: Which real-world datasets are used?", "output": "Tweets related to CyberAttack and tweets related to PoliticianDeath. Explanation: Following previous studies BIBREF1, we collect event-related microposts from Twitter using 11 and 8 seed events (see Section SECREF2) for CyberAttack and PoliticianDeath, respectively."}

{"input": "Conversational information seeking (CIS) has been recognized as a major emerging research area in information retrieval. Such research will require data and tools, to allow the implementation and study of conversational systems. This paper introduces Macaw, an open-source framework with a modular architecture for CIS research. Macaw supports multi-turn, multi-modal, and mixed-initiative interactions, and enables research for tasks such as document retrieval, question answering, recommendation, and structured data exploration. It has a modular design to encourage the study of new CIS algorithms, which can be evaluated in batch mode. It can also integrate with a user interface, which allows user studies and data collection in an interactive mode, where the back end can be fully algorithmic or a wizard of oz setup. Macaw is distributed under the MIT License.\nQuestion: What functionality does Macaw provide?", "output": "Co-Reference Resolution. Explanation: Co-Reference Resolution: To support multi-turn interactions, it is sometimes necessary to use co-reference resolution techniques for effective retrieval. In Macaw, we identify all the co-references from the last request of user to the conversation history. The same co-reference resolution outputs can be used for different query generation components. This can be a generic or action-specific component.\n\nQuery Generation: This component generates a query based on the past user-system interactions. The query generation component may take advantage of co-reference resolution for query expansion or re-writing.\n\nRetrieval Model: This is the core ranking component that retrieves documents or passages from a large collection. Macaw can retrieve documents from an arbitrary document collection using the Indri python interface BIBREF9, BIBREF10. We also provide the support for web search using the Bing Web Search API. Macaw also allows multi-stage document re-ranking.\n\nResult Generation: The retrieved documents can be too long to be presented using some interfaces. Result generation is basically a post-processing step ran on the retrieved result list. In case of question answering, it can employ answer selection or generation techniques, such as machine reading comprehension models. For example, Macaw features the DrQA model BIBREF11 for question answering."}

Explanation: We have implemented the following interfaces for Macaw:\n\n[leftmargin=*]\n\nFile IO: This interface is designed for experimental purposes, such as evaluating the performance of a conversational search technique on a dataset with multiple queries. This is not an interactive interface.\n\nStandard IO: This interactive command line interface is designed for development purposes to interact with the system, see the logs, and debug or improve the system.\n\nTelegram: This interactive interface is designed for interaction with real users (see FIGREF4). Telegram is a popular instant messaging service whose client-side code is open-source. We have implemented a Telegram bot that can be used with different devices (personal computers, tablets, and mobile phones) and different operating systems (Android, iOS, Linux, Mac OS, and Windows). This interface allows multi-modal interactions (text, speech, click, image). It can be also used for speech-only interactions. For speech recognition and generation, Macaw relies on online APIs, e.g., the services provided by Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure. In addition, there exist multiple popular groups and channels in Telegram, which allows further integration of social networks with conversational systems. For example, see the Naseri and Zamani's study on news popularity in Telegram BIBREF12."}

We keep the default parameters that were provided with the implementation. To represent the tweets, we use the decoded embedding produced by the model. With this baseline we aim at assessing if the tweets' hashtags may help detecting the non-factual accounts.\n\nLR + All Features (tweet-level): We extract all our features from each tweet and feed them into a LR classifier. Here, we do not aggregate over tweets and thus view each tweet independently.\n\nLR + All Features (chunk-level): We concatenate the features' vectors of the tweets in a chunk and feed them into a LR classifier.\n\nFacTweet (tweet-level): Similar to the FacTweet approach, but at tweet-level; the sequential flow of the tweets is not utilized. We aim at investigating the importance of the sequential flow of tweets.\n\nTop-$k$ replies, likes, or re-tweets: Some approaches in rumors detection use the number of replies, likes, and re-tweets to detect rumors BIBREF21. Thus, we extract top $k$ replied, liked or re-tweeted tweets from each account to assess the accounts factuality. We tested different $k$ values between 10 tweets to the max number of tweets from each account. Figure FIGREF24 shows the macro-F1 values for different $k$ values. It seems that $k=500$ for the top replied tweets achieves the highest result. Therefore, we consider this as a baseline."}

In contrast, here we target several different kinds of offensive content. In particular, we model the task hierarchically, identifying the type and the target of offensive messages in social media.

{"input": "Evaluation of text summarization approaches have been mostly based on metrics that measure similarities of system generated summaries with a set of human written gold-standard summaries.

{"input": "Deep reading models for question-answering have demonstrated promising performance over the last couple of years. However current systems tend to learn how to cleverly extract a span of the source document, based on its similarity with the question, instead of seeking for the appropriate answer. Indeed, a reading machine should be able to detect relevant passages in a document regarding a question, but more importantly, it should be able to reason over the important pieces of the document in order to produce an answer when it is required. To motivate this purpose, we present ReviewQA, a question-answering dataset based on hotel reviews. The questions of this dataset are linked to a set of relational understanding competencies that we expect a model to master. Indeed, each question comes with an associated type that characterizes the required competency. With this framework, it is possible to benchmark the main families of models and to get an overview of what are the strengths and the weaknesses of a given model on the set of tasks evaluated in this dataset. Our corpus contains more than 500.000 questions in natural language over 100.000 hotel reviews. Our setup is projective, the answer of a question does not need to be extracted from a document, like in most of the recent datasets, but selected among a set of candidates that contains all the possible answers to the questions of the dataset. Finally, we present several baselines over this dataset.\nQuestion: What kind of questions are present in the dataset?", "output": "These 8 tasks require different competencies and a different level of understanding of the document to be well answered. Explanation: We introduce a list of 8 different competencies that a reading system should master in order to process reviews and text documents in general. These 8 tasks require different competencies and a different level of understanding of the document to be well answered. For instance, detecting if an aspect is mentioned in a review will require less understanding of the review than predicting explicitly the rating of this aspect. Table TABREF10 presents the 8 tasks we have introduced in this dataset with an example of a question that corresponds to each task."}
{"input": "Deep reading models for question-answering have demonstrated promising performance over the last couple of years. However current systems tend to learn how to cleverly extract a span of the source document, based on its similarity with the question, instead of seeking for the appropriate answer. Indeed, a reading machine should be able to detect relevant passages in a document regarding a question, but more importantly, it should be able to reason over the important pieces of the document in order to produce an answer when it is required. To motivate this purpose, we present ReviewQA, a question-answering dataset based on hotel reviews. The questions of this dataset are linked to a set of relational understanding competencies that we expect a model to master. Indeed, each question comes with an associated type that characterizes the required competency. With this framework, it is possible to benchmark the main families of models and to get an overview of what are the strengths and the weaknesses of a given model on the set of tasks evaluated in this dataset. Our corpus contains more than 500.000 questions in natural language over 100.000 hotel reviews. Our setup is projective, the answer of a question does not need to be extracted from a document, like in most of the recent datasets, but selected among a set of candidates that contains all the possible answers to the questions of the dataset. Finally, we present several baselines over this dataset.\nQuestion: What baselines are presented?", "output": "Logistic regression. Explanation: Logistic regression: To produce the representation of the input, we concatenate the Bag-Of-Words representation of the document with the Bag-Of-Words representation of the question."}

{"input": "Text simplification (TS) can be viewed as monolingual translation task, translating between text variations within a single language. Recent neural TS models draw on insights from neural machine translation to learn lexical simplification and content reduction using encoder-decoder model.

{"input": "Detecting offensive language on Twitter has many applications ranging from detecting/predicting bullying to measuring polarization. In this paper, we focus on building effective Arabic offensive tweet detection. We introduce a method for building an offensive dataset that is not biased by topic, dialect, or target. We produce the largest Arabic dataset to date with special tags for vulgarity and hate speech. Next, we analyze the dataset to determine which topics, dialects, and gender are most associated with offensive tweets and how Arabic speakers use offensive language. Lastly, we conduct a large battery of experiments to produce strong results (F1 = 79.7) on the dataset using Support Vector Machine techniques.\nQuestion: What are the distinctive characteristics of how Arabic speakers use offensive language?", "output": "Frequent use of direct animal name calling, using simile and metaphors, through indirect speech like sarcasm, wishing evil to others, name alteration, societal stratification, immoral behavior and sexually related uses.. Explanation: Next, we analyzed all tweets labeled as offensive to better understand how Arabic speakers use offensive language. Here is a breakdown of usage:\n\nDirect name calling: The most frequent attack is to call a person an animal name, and the most used animals were \u0643\u0644\u0628> (\u201cklb\u201d \u2013 \u201cdog\u201d), \u062d\u0645\u0627\u0631> (\u201cHmAr\u201d \u2013 \u201cdonkey\u201d), and \u0628\u0647\u064a\u0645> (\u201cbhym\u201d \u2013 \u201cbeast\u201d). The second most common was insulting mental abilities using words such as \u063a\u0628\u064a> (\u201cgby\u201d \u2013 \u201cstupid\u201d) and \u0639\u0628\u064a\u0637> (\u201cEbyT\u201d \u2013\u201cidiot\u201d). Some culture-specific differences should be considered. Not all animal names are used as insults.

Although many prior research studies have been conducted in irony detection, few studies focus on irony generation. The main challenges for irony generation are the lack of large-scale irony dataset and difficulties in modeling the ironic pattern. In this work, we first systematically define irony generation based on style transfer task. To address the lack of data, we make use of twitter and build a large-scale dataset. We also design a combination of rewards for reinforcement learning to control the generation of ironic sentences. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our model in terms of irony accuracy, sentiment preservation, and content preservation.\nQuestion: What experiments are conducted?", "output": "Irony Classifier.

Explanation: According to the categories mentioned in BIBREF5 , irony can be classified into 3 classes: verbal irony by means of a polarity contrast, the sentences containing expression whose polarity is inverted between the intended and the literal evaluation; other types of verbal irony, the sentences that show no polarity contrast between the literal and intended meaning but are still ironic; and situational irony, the sentences that describe situations that fail to meet some expectations. As ironies in the latter two categories are obscure and hard to understand, we decide to only focus on ironies in the first category in this work."}

Explanation: Besides, we report the sentiment accuracy (Senti ACC) which measures whether the output sentence has the same sentiment polarity as the input sentence based on our standardized sentiment classifiers. The BLEU score BIBREF25 between the input sentences and the output sentences is calculated to evaluate the content preservation performance. In order to evaluate the overall performance of different models, we also report the geometric mean (G2) and harmonic mean (H2) of the sentiment accuracy and the BLEU score. As for the irony accuracy, we only report it in human evaluation results because it is more accurate for the human to evaluate the quality of irony as it is very complicated."}

{"input": "Shallow syntax provides an approximation of phrase-syntactic structure of sentences; it can be produced with high accuracy, and is computationally cheap to obtain. We investigate the role of shallow syntax-aware representations for NLP tasks using two techniques. First, we enhance the ELMo architecture to allow pretraining on predicted shallow syntactic parses, instead of just raw text, so that contextual embeddings make use of shallow syntactic context. Our second method involves shallow syntactic features obtained automatically on downstream task data. Neither approach leads to a significant gain on any of the four downstream tasks we considered relative to ELMo-only baselines. Further analysis using black-box probes confirms that our shallow-syntax-aware contextual embeddings do not transfer to linguistic tasks any more easily than ELMo's embeddings.

We take these findings as evidence that ELMo-style pretraining discovers representations which make additional awareness of shallow syntax redundant.\nQuestion: Which syntactic features are obtained automatically on downstream task data?", "output": "token-level chunk label embeddings. Explanation: Our second approach incorporates shallow syntactic information in downstream tasks via token-level chunk label embeddings. Task training (and test) data is automatically chunked, and chunk boundary information is passed into the task model via BIOUL encoding of the labels. We add randomly initialized chunk label embeddings to task-specific input encoders, which are then fine-tuned for task-specific objectives."}
{"input": "To extract the structured representations of open-domain events, Bayesian graphical models have made some progress. However, these approaches typically assume that all words in a document are generated from a single event. While this may be true for short text such as tweets, such an assumption does not generally hold for long text such as news articles. Moreover, Bayesian graphical models often rely on Gibbs sampling for parameter inference which may take long time to converge. To address these limitations, we propose an event extraction model based on Generative Adversarial Nets, called Adversarial-neural Event Model (AEM). AEM models an event with a Dirichlet prior and uses a generator network to capture the patterns underlying latent events. A discriminator is used to distinguish documents reconstructed from the latent events and the original documents. A byproduct of the discriminator is that the features generated by the learned discriminator network allow the visualization of the extracted events. Our model has been evaluated on two Twitter datasets and a news article dataset. Experimental results show that our model outperforms the baseline approaches on all the datasets, with more significant improvements observed on the news article dataset where an increase of 15\\% is observed in F-measure.\nQuestion: What baseline approaches does this approach out-perform?", "output": "K-means. Explanation: We choose the following three models as the baselines:\n\nK-means is a well known data clustering algorithm, we implement the algorithm using sklearn toolbox, and represent documents using bag-of-words weighted by TF-IDF.\n\nLEM BIBREF13 is a Bayesian modeling approach for open-domain event extraction. It treats an event as a latent variable and models the generation of an event as a joint distribution of its individual event elements. We implement the algorithm with the default configuration.\n\nDPEMM BIBREF14 is a non-parametric mixture model for event extraction. It addresses the limitation of LEM that the number of events should be known beforehand. We implement the model with the default configuration."}

Explanation: Instead of providing an analytic approximation, AEM uses a discriminator network to discriminate between the reconstructed documents from latent events and the original input documents. This essentially helps the generator to construct a more realistic document from a random noise drawn from a Dirichlet distribution. Due to the flexibility of neural networks, the generator is capable of learning complicated nonlinear distributions. And the supervision signal provided by the discriminator will help generator to capture the event-related patterns."}

The TIMIT dataset contains speech from 462 speakers in training and 168 speakers in the test set, with 8 utterances for each speaker. The TIMIT training and test set are split into 8 blocks, where each block contains 2 utterances per speaker, randomly chosen. Thus each block A,B,C,D contains data from 462 speakers with 924 utterances taken from the training sets, and each block E,F,G,H contains speech from 168 test set speakers with 336 utterances.\n\nFor Task a training of embeddings and the classifier is identical, namely consisting of data from blocks (A+B+C+E+F+G). The test data is the remainder, namely blocks (D+H). For Task b the training of embeddings and classifiers uses (A+B+E+F) and (C+G) respectively, while again using (D+H) for test.

We show that our proposed model is effective in handling both homographic and heterographic puns. Empirical results on the benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach can achieve new state-of-the-art results.\nQuestion: What state-of-the-art results are achieved?", "output": "F1 score of 92.19 on homographic pun detection, 80.19 on homographic pun location, 89.76 on heterographic pun detection..

{"input": "Question generation (QG) is the task of generating a question from a reference sentence and a specified answer within the sentence. A major challenge in QG is to identify answer-relevant context words to finish the declarative-to-interrogative sentence transformation. Existing sequence-to-sequence neural models achieve this goal by proximity-based answer position encoding under the intuition that neighboring words of answers are of high possibility to be answer-relevant. However, such intuition may not apply to all cases especially for sentences with complex answer-relevant relations. Consequently, the performance of these models drops sharply when the relative distance between the answer fragment and other non-stop sentence words that also appear in the ground truth question increases. To address this issue, we propose a method to jointly model the unstructured sentence and the structured answer-relevant relation (extracted from the sentence in advance) for question generation. Specifically, the structured answer-relevant relation acts as the to the point context and it thus naturally helps keep the generated question to the point, while the unstructured sentence provides the full information. Extensive experiments show that to the point context helps our question generation model achieve significant improvements on several automatic evaluation metrics. Furthermore, our model is capable of generating diverse questions for a sentence which conveys multiple relations of its answer fragment.\nQuestion: How they extract \"structured answer-relevant relation\"?", "output": "Using the OpenIE toolbox and applying heuristic rules to select the most relevant relation.. Explanation: Specifically, we firstly extract multiple relations with an off-the-shelf Open Information Extraction (OpenIE) toolbox BIBREF7, then we select the relation that is most relevant to the answer with carefully designed heuristic rules."}

{"input": "Although neural machine translation (NMT) has advanced the state-of-the-art on various language pairs, the interpretability of NMT remains unsatisfactory. In this work, we propose to address this gap by focusing on understanding the input-output behavior of NMT models. Specifically, we measure the word importance by attributing the NMT output to every input word through a gradient-based method. We validate the approach on a couple of perturbation operations, language pairs, and model architectures, demonstrating its superiority on identifying input words with higher influence on translation performance. Encouragingly, the calculated importance can serve as indicators of input words that are under-translated by NMT models. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that words of certain syntactic categories have higher importance while the categories vary across language pairs, which can inspire better design principles of NMT architectures for multi-lingual translation.\nQuestion: How do they measure which words are under-translated by NMT models?", "output": "They measured the under-translated words with low word importance score as calculated by Attribution.\nmethod. Explanation: Intuitively, under-translated input words should contribute little to the NMT outputs, yielding much smaller word importance."}

We considered the GTZAN Music-Speech dataset [17], consisting of 120 audio files (60 speech and 60 music), for task of classifying speech and music. Each audio file (of 2 seconds duration) is represented using a 13-dimensional mel-frequency cepstral coefficient (MFCC) vector, where each MFCC vector is the average of all the frame level (frame size of 30 msec and an overlap of 10 msec) MFCC vectors. It is to be noted that our main intention for this task is not better feature selection, but to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, in particular for low data scenarios."}
{"input": "To bridge the gap between Machine Reading Comprehension (MRC) models and human beings, which is mainly reflected in the hunger for data and the robustness to noise, in this paper, we explore how to integrate the neural networks of MRC models with the general knowledge of human beings. On the one hand, we propose a data enrichment method, which uses WordNet to extract inter-word semantic connections as general knowledge from each given passage-question pair. On the other hand, we propose an end-to-end MRC model named as Knowledge Aided Reader (KAR), which explicitly uses the above extracted general knowledge to assist its attention mechanisms. Based on the data enrichment method, KAR is comparable in performance with the state-of-the-art MRC models, and significantly more robust to noise than them. When only a subset (20%-80%) of the training examples are available, KAR outperforms the state-of-the-art MRC models by a large margin, and is still reasonably robust to noise.\nQuestion: How do the authors examine whether a model is robust to noise or not?", "output": "By evaluating their model on adversarial sets containing misleading sentences. Explanation: Besides, we also use two of its adversarial sets, namely AddSent and AddOneSent BIBREF6 , to evaluate the robustness to noise of MRC models. The passages in the adversarial sets contain misleading sentences, which are aimed at distracting MRC models."}

In this paper, we conduct the first comparative study of various learning models on Hate and Abusive Speech on Twitter, and discuss the possibility of using additional features and context data for improvements.

Explanation: While manually analyzing the raw dataset, we noticed that looking at the tweet one has replied to or has quoted, provides significant contextual information.

As humans can better understand a tweet with the reference of its context, our assumption is that computers also benefit from taking context tweets into account in detecting abusive language.\n\nAs shown in the examples below, (2) is labeled abusive due to the use of vulgar language.

However, their approach was limited because the meta-information they focused on\u2014author information, conversation type, use of the same hashtags or emojis\u2014are all highly dependent on data.\n\nIn order to avoid data dependency, text sequences of context tweets are directly used as an additional feature of neural network models. We use the same baseline model to convert context tweets to vectors, then concatenate these vectors with outputs of their corresponding labeled tweets. More specifically, we concatenate max-pooled layers of context and labeled tweets for the CNN baseline model. As for RNN, the last hidden states of context and labeled tweets are concatenated."}

{"input": "Generated hateful and toxic content by a portion of users in social media is a rising phenomenon that motivated researchers to dedicate substantial efforts to the challenging direction of hateful content identification. We not only need an efficient automatic hate speech detection model based on advanced machine learning and natural language processing, but also a sufficiently large amount of annotated data to train a model. The lack of a sufficient amount of labelled hate speech data, along with the existing biases, has been the main issue in this domain of research. To address these needs, in this study we introduce a novel transfer learning approach based on an existing pre-trained language model called BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers). More specifically, we investigate the ability of BERT at capturing hateful context within social media content by using new fine-tuning methods based on transfer learning. To evaluate our proposed approach, we use two publicly available datasets that have been annotated for racism, sexism, hate, or offensive content on Twitter. The results show that our solution obtains considerable performance on these datasets in terms of precision and recall in comparison to existing approaches. Consequently, our model can capture some biases in data annotation and collection process and can potentially lead us to a more accurate model.\nQuestion: What evidence do the authors present that the model can capture some biases in data annotation and collection?", "output": "The authors showed few tweets where neither and implicit hatred content exist but the model was able to discriminate. Explanation: Tweets IDs 6, 8, and 10 are some samples containing offensive words and slurs which arenot hate or offensive in all cases and writers of them used this type of language in their daily communications. Given these pieces of evidence, by considering the content of tweets, we can see in tweets IDs 3, 4, and 9 that our BERT-based classifier can discriminate tweets in which neither and implicit hatred content exist."}

In this architecture, only the [CLS] token output provided by BERT is used. The [CLS] output, which is equivalent to the [CLS] token output of the 12th transformer encoder, a vector of size 768, is given as input to a fully connected network without hidden layer. The softmax activation function is applied to the hidden layer to classify.\n\n2. Insert nonlinear layers: Here, the first architecture is upgraded and an architecture with a more robust classifier is provided in which instead of using a fully connected network without hidden layer, a fully connected network with two hidden layers in size 768 is used. The first two layers use the Leaky Relu activation function with negative slope = 0.01, but the final layer, as the first architecture, uses softmax activation function as shown in Figure FIGREF8.\n\n3. Insert Bi-LSTM layer: Unlike previous architectures that only use [CLS] as the input for the classifier, in this architecture all outputs of the latest transformer encoder are used in such a way that they are given as inputs to a bidirectional recurrent neural network (Bi-LSTM) as shown in Figure FIGREF8. After processing the input, the network sends the final hidden state to a fully connected network that performs classification using the softmax activation function.\n\n4. Insert CNN layer: In this architecture shown in Figure FIGREF8, the outputs of all transformer encoders are used instead of using the output of the latest transformer encoder. So that the output vectors of each transformer encoder are concatenated, and a matrix is produced. The convolutional operation is performed with a window of size (3, hidden size of BERT which is 768 in BERTbase model) and the maximum value is generated for each transformer encoder by applying max pooling on the convolution output. By concatenating these values, a vector is generated which is given as input to a fully connected network. By applying softmax on the input, the classification operation is performed."}
{"input": "Generated hateful and toxic content by a portion of users in social media is a rising phenomenon that motivated researchers to dedicate substantial efforts to the challenging direction of hateful content identification. We not only need an efficient automatic hate speech detection model based on advanced machine learning and natural language processing, but also a sufficiently large amount of annotated data to train a model. The lack of a sufficient amount of labelled hate speech data, along with the existing biases, has been the main issue in this domain of research. To address these needs, in this study we introduce a novel transfer learning approach based on an existing pre-trained language model called BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers). More specifically, we investigate the ability of BERT at capturing hateful context within social media content by using new fine-tuning methods based on transfer learning. To evaluate our proposed approach, we use two publicly available datasets that have been annotated for racism, sexism, hate, or offensive content on Twitter. The results show that our solution obtains considerable performance on these datasets in terms of precision and recall in comparison to existing approaches. Consequently, our model can capture some biases in data annotation and collection process and can potentially lead us to a more accurate model.\nQuestion: What are the existing biases?", "output": "systematic and substantial racial biases.

However, these misclassifications do not confirm the low performance of our classifier because annotators tended to annotate many samples containing disrespectful words as hate or offensive without any presumption about the social context of tweeters such as the speaker\u2019s identity or dialect, whereas they were just offensive or even neither tweets."}

{"input": "As an ubiquitous method in natural language processing, word embeddings are extensively employed to map semantic properties of words into a dense vector representation. They capture semantic and syntactic relations among words but the vector corresponding to the words are only meaningful relative to each other. Neither the vector nor its dimensions have any absolute, interpretable meaning. We introduce an additive modification to the objective function of the embedding learning algorithm that encourages the embedding vectors of words that are semantically related to a predefined concept to take larger values along a specified dimension, while leaving the original semantic learning mechanism mostly unaffected. In other words, we align words that are already determined to be related, along predefined concepts. Therefore, we impart interpretability to the word embedding by assigning meaning to its vector dimensions. The predefined concepts are derived from an external lexical resource, which in this paper is chosen as Roget's Thesaurus. We observe that alignment along the chosen concepts is not limited to words in the Thesaurus and extends to other related words as well. We quantify the extent of interpretability and assignment of meaning from our experimental results. We also demonstrate the preservation of semantic coherence of the resulting vector space by using word-analogy and word-similarity tests.

But, this method is expensive to apply since it requires evaluations from multiple human evaluators for each embedding dimension.

Specifically, we apply a modified version of the approach presented in BIBREF40 in order to consider possible sub-groupings within the categories in SEMCAT."}

We used the following global network properties:\n\nNumber of Strongly Connected Components (SCC): a Strongly Connected Component of a directed graph is a maximal (sub)graph where for each pair of vertices $u,v$ there is a path in each direction ($u\\rightarrow v$, $v\\rightarrow u$).\n\nSize of the Largest Strongly Connected Component (LSCC): the number of nodes in the largest strongly connected component of a given graph.\n\nNumber of Weakly Connected Components (WCC): a Weakly Connected Component of a directed graph is a maximal (sub)graph where for each pair of vertices $(u, v)$ there is a path $u \\leftrightarrow v$ ignoring edge directions.\n\nSize of the Largest Weakly Connected Component (LWCC): the number of nodes in the largest weakly connected component of a given graph.\n\nDiameter of the Largest Weakly Connected Component (DWCC): the largest distance (length of the shortest path) between two nodes in the (undirected version of) largest weakly connected component of a graph.\n\nAverage Clustering Coefficient (CC): the average of the local clustering coefficients of all nodes in a graph; the local clustering coefficient of a node quantifies how close its neighbours are to being a complete graph (or a clique). It is computed according to BIBREF28.\n\nMain K-core Number (KC): a K-core BIBREF13 of a graph is a maximal sub-graph that contains nodes of internal degree $k$ or more; the main K-core number is the highest value of $k$ (in directed graphs the total degree is considered).\n\nDensity (d): the density for directed graphs is $d=\\frac{|E|}{|V||V-1|}$, where $|E|$ is the number of edges and $|N|$ is the number of vertices in the graph; the density equals 0 for a graph without edges and 1 for a complete graph.\n\nStructural virality of the largest weakly connected component (SV): this measure is defined in BIBREF14 as the average distance between all pairs of nodes in a cascade tree or, equivalently, as the average depth of nodes, averaged over all nodes in turn acting as a root; for $|V| > 1$ vertices, $SV=\\frac{1}{|V||V-1|}\\sum _i\\sum _j d_{ij}$ where $d_{ij}$ denotes the length of the shortest path between nodes $i$ and $j$. This is equivalent to compute the Wiener's index BIBREF29 of the graph and multiply it by a factor $\\frac{1}{|V||V-1|}$. In our case we computed it for the undirected equivalent graph of the largest weakly connected component, setting it to 0 whenever $V=1$."}

{"input": "In this work, we focus on the task of generating natural language descriptions from a structured table of facts containing fields (such as nationality, occupation, etc) and values (such as Indian, actor, director, etc). One simple choice is to treat the table as a sequence of fields and values and then use a standard seq2seq model for this task. However, such a model is too generic and does not exploit task-specific characteristics. For example, while generating descriptions from a table, a human would attend to information at two levels: (i) the fields (macro level) and (ii) the values within the field (micro level). Further, a human would continue attending to a field for a few timesteps till all the information from that field has been rendered and then never return back to this field (because there is nothing left to say about it). To capture this behavior we use (i) a fused bifocal attention mechanism which exploits and combines this micro and macro level information and (ii) a gated orthogonalization mechanism which tries to ensure that a field is remembered for a few time steps and then forgotten. We experiment with a recently released dataset which contains fact tables about people and their corresponding one line biographical descriptions in English.

{"input": "To combat adversarial spelling mistakes, we propose placing a word recognition model in front of the downstream classifier. Our word recognition models build upon the RNN semicharacter architecture, introducing several new backoff strategies for handling rare and unseen words. Trained to recognize words corrupted by random adds, drops, swaps, and keyboard mistakes, our method achieves 32% relative (and 3.3% absolute) error reduction over the vanilla semi-character model. Notably, our pipeline confers robustness on the downstream classifier, outperforming both adversarial training and off-the-shelf spell checkers. Against a BERT model fine-tuned for sentiment analysis, a single adversarially-chosen character attack lowers accuracy from 90.3% to 45.8%. Our defense restores accuracy to 75%\n1 .

Explanation: Inspired by the psycholinguistic studies BIBREF5 , BIBREF4 , BIBREF7 proposed a semi-character based RNN (ScRNN) that processes a sentence of words with misspelled characters, predicting the correct words at each step. Let $s = \\lbrace w_1, w_2, \\dots , w_n\\rbrace $ denote the input sentence, a sequence of constituent words $w_i$ . Each input word ( $w_i$ ) is represented by concatenating (i) a one hot vector of the first character ( $\\mathbf {w_{i1}}$ ); (ii) a one hot representation of the last character ( $\\mathbf {w_{il}}$ , where $l$ is the length of word $w_i$ ); and (iii) a bag of characters representation of the internal characters ( $\\sum _{j=2}^{l-1}\\mathbf {w_{ij}})$ . ScRNN treats the first and the last characters individually, and is agnostic to the ordering of the internal characters. Each word, represented accordingly, is then fed into a BiLSTM cell. At each sequence step, the training target is the correct corresponding word (output dimension equal to vocabulary size), and the model is optimized with cross-entropy loss."}

{"input": "Attention mechanisms have become ubiquitous in NLP. Recent architectures, notably the Transformer, learn powerful context-aware word representations through layered, multi-headed attention. The multiple heads learn diverse types of word relationships. However, with standard softmax attention, all attention heads are dense, assigning a non-zero weight to all context words. In this work, we introduce the adaptively sparse Transformer, wherein attention heads have flexible, context-dependent sparsity patterns. This sparsity is accomplished by replacing softmax with $\\alpha$-entmax: a differentiable generalization of softmax that allows low-scoring words to receive precisely zero weight. Moreover, we derive a method to automatically learn the $\\alpha$ parameter -- which controls the shape and sparsity of $\\alpha$-entmax -- allowing attention heads to choose between focused or spread-out behavior. Our adaptively sparse Transformer improves interpretability and head diversity when compared to softmax Transformers on machine translation datasets. Findings of the quantitative and qualitative analysis of our approach include that heads in different layers learn different sparsity preferences and tend to be more diverse in their attention distributions than softmax Transformers.

{"input": "Sentiments of words differ from one corpus to another. Inducing general sentiment lexicons for languages and using them cannot, in general, produce meaningful results for different domains. In this paper, we combine contextual and supervised information with the general semantic representations of words occurring in the dictionary. Contexts of words help us capture the domain-specific information and supervised scores of words are indicative of the polarities of those words. When we combine supervised features of words with the features extracted from their dictionary definitions, we observe an increase in the success rates. We try out the combinations of contextual, supervised, and dictionary-based approaches, and generate original vectors. We also combine the word2vec approach with hand-crafted features. We induce domain-specific sentimental vectors for two corpora, which are the movie domain and the Twitter datasets in Turkish. When we thereafter generate document vectors and employ the support vector machines method utilising those vectors, our approaches perform better than the baseline studies for Turkish with a significant margin.

They use the word2vec algorithm, create several unsupervised hand-crafted features, generate document vectors and feed them as input into the support vector machines (SVM) approach. We outperform this baseline approach using more effective word embeddings and supervised hand-crafted features."}

Explanation: For Turkish, as the first dataset, we utilised the movie reviews which are collected from a popular website. The number of reviews in this movie corpus is 20,244 and the average number of words in reviews is 39. Each of these reviews has a star-rating score which is indicative of sentiment. These polarity scores are between the values 0.5 and 5, at intervals of 0.5. We consider a review to be negative it the score is equal to or lower than 2.5. On the other hand, if it is equal to or higher than 4, it is assumed to be positive. We have randomly selected 7,020 negative and 7,020 positive reviews and processed only them."}

Explanation: In addition to it, we extract three hand-crafted polarity scores, which are minimum, mean, and maximum polarity scores, from each review. These polarity scores of words are computed as in (DISPLAY_FORM4). For example, if a review consists of five words, it would have five polarity scores and we utilise only three of these sentiment scores as mentioned.

We then feed these inputs into the SVM approach. The flowchart of our framework is given in Figure FIGREF11. When combining the unsupervised features, which are word vectors created on a word basis, with supervised three scores extracted on a review basis, we have better state-of-the-art results."}

Deeper LSTM models perform well on large vocabulary continuous speech recognition, because of their impressive learning ability. However, it is more difficult to train a deeper network. We introduce a training framework with layer-wise training and exponential moving average methods for deeper LSTM models. It is a competitive framework that LSTM models of more than 7 layers are successfully trained on Shenma voice search data in Mandarin and they outperform the deep LSTM models trained by conventional approach. Moreover, in order for online streaming speech recognition applications, the shallow model with low real time factor is distilled from the very deep model. The recognition accuracy have little loss in the distillation process. Therefore, the model trained with the proposed training framework reduces relative 14\\% character error rate, compared to original model which has the similar real-time capability.

{"input": "Speech emotion recognition is a challenging task, and extensive reliance has been placed on models that use audio features in building well-performing classifiers. In this paper, we propose a novel deep dual recurrent encoder model that utilizes text data and audio signals simultaneously to obtain a better understanding of speech data. As emotional dialogue is composed of sound and spoken content, our model encodes the information from audio and text sequences using dual recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and then combines the information from these sources to predict the emotion class. This architecture analyzes speech data from the signal level to the language level, and it thus utilizes the information within the data more comprehensively than models that focus on audio features. Extensive experiments are conducted to investigate the efficacy and properties of the proposed model. Our proposed model outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in assigning data to one of four emotion categories (i.e., angry, happy, sad and neutral) when the model is applied to the IEMOCAP dataset, as reflected by accuracies ranging from 68.8% to 71.8%.\nQuestion: Do they use datasets with transcribed text or do they determine text from the audio?", "output": "They use text transcription..

{"input": "The automatic identification of propaganda has gained significance in recent years due to technological and social changes in the way news is generated and consumed. That this task can be addressed effectively using BERT, a powerful new architecture which can be fine-tuned for text classification tasks, is not surprising. However, propaganda detection, like other tasks that deal with news documents and other forms of decontextualized social communication (e.g. sentiment analysis), inherently deals with data whose categories are simultaneously imbalanced and dissimilar. We show that BERT, while capable of handling imbalanced classes with no additional data augmentation, does not generalise well when the training and test data are sufficiently dissimilar (as is often the case with news sources, whose topics evolve over time). We show how to address this problem by providing a statistical measure of similarity between datasets and a method of incorporating cost-weighting into BERT when the training and test sets are dissimilar. We test these methods on the Propaganda Techniques Corpus (PTC) and achieve the second-highest score on sentence-level propaganda classification.\nQuestion: How is \"propaganda\" defined for the purposes of this study?", "output": "an intentional and potentially multicast communication. Explanation: The term `propaganda' derives from propagare in post-classical Latin, as in \u201cpropagation of the faith\" BIBREF1, and thus has from the beginning been associated with an intentional and potentially multicast communication; only later did it become a pejorative term. It was pragmatically defined in the World War II era as \u201cthe expression of an opinion or an action by individuals or groups deliberately designed to influence the opinions or the actions of other individuals or groups with reference to predetermined ends\" BIBREF2."}

Experimental results indicate that these multiple sources of information can be used to learn partial semantic supervision that matches previous techniques in intrinsic evaluation tasks. Our approaches are also evaluated for their impact on a machine translation system where we show improvements in translation quality, demonstrating that compositionality in interpretation correlates with compositionality in translation.\nQuestion: How do they score phrasal compositionality?", "output": "Spearman's INLINEFORM0 between phrasal similarities derived from our compositional functions and the human annotators. Explanation: We evaluated the phrase compositionality models on the adjective\u2013noun and noun\u2013noun phrase similarity tasks compiled by Mitchell2010, using the same evaluation scheme as in the original work. Spearman's INLINEFORM0 between phrasal similarities derived from our compositional functions and the human annotators (computed individually per annotator and then averaged across all annotators) was the evaluation measure."}

{"input": "Dehumanization is a pernicious psychological process that often leads to extreme intergroup bias, hate speech, and violence aimed at targeted social groups. Despite these serious consequences and the wealth of available data, dehumanization has not yet been computationally studied on a large scale. Drawing upon social psychology research, we create a computational linguistic framework for analyzing dehumanizing language by identifying linguistic correlates of salient components of dehumanization. We then apply this framework to analyze discussions of LGBTQ people in the New York Times from 1986 to 2015. Overall, we find increasingly humanizing descriptions of LGBTQ people over time. However, we find that the label homosexual has emerged to be much more strongly associated with dehumanizing attitudes than other labels, such as gay. Our proposed techniques highlight processes of linguistic variation and change in discourses surrounding marginalized groups. Furthermore, the ability to analyze dehumanizing language at a large scale has implications for automatically detecting and understanding media bias as well as abusive language online.\nQuestion: How do they identify discussions of LGBTQ people in the New York Times?", "output": "act paragraphs containing any word from a predetermined list of LGTBQ terms.

In this paper, we use a feature-rich recurrent neural network model that uses a variety of linguistic and surface-level features to recover both core word diacritics and case endings. Our model surpasses all previous state-of-the-art systems with a CW error rate (CWER) of 2.86\\% and a CE error rate (CEER) of 3.7% for Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) and CWER of 2.2% and CEER of 2.5% for Classical Arabic (CA). When combining diacritized word cores with case endings, the resultant word error rate is 6.0% and 4.3% for MSA and CA respectively. This highlights the effectiveness of feature engineering for such deep neural models.\nQuestion: what surface-level features are used?", "output": "affixes, leading and trailing characters in words and stems, and the presence of words in large gazetteers of named entities. Explanation: The flexibility of the DNN model allowed us to include many more surface level features such as affixes, leading and trailing characters in words and stems, and the presence of words in large gazetteers of named entities. As we show later, these additional features significantly lowered CEER."}

{"input": "Previous work on multimodal machine translation has shown that visual information is only needed in very specific cases, for example in the presence of ambiguous words where the textual context is not sufficient. As a consequence, models tend to learn to ignore this information. We propose a translate-and-refine approach to this problem where images are only used by a second stage decoder. This approach is trained jointly to generate a good first draft translation and to improve over this draft by (i) making better use of the target language textual context (both left and right-side contexts) and (ii) making use of visual context. This approach leads to the state of the art results. Additionally, we show that it has the ability to recover from erroneous or missing words in the source language.\nQuestion: What dataset does this approach achieve state of the art results on?", "output": "the English-German dataset.

In this paper, we look at a model's ability to generalize on a simple symbol rewriting task with a clearly defined structure. We find that the model's ability to generalize this structure beyond the training distribution depends greatly on the chosen random seed, even when performance on the standard test set remains the same. This suggests that a model's ability to capture generalizable structure is highly sensitive. Moreover, this sensitivity may not be apparent when evaluating it on standard test sets.\nQuestion: Why does the proposed task a good proxy for the general-purpose sequence to sequence tasks?", "output": "The task is set up to mimic (albeit, in an oversimplified manner) the input-output symbol alignments and local syntactic properties that models must learn in many natural language tasks, such as translation, tagging and summarization..

{"input": "The Internet and online forums such as Reddit have become an increasingly popular medium for citizens to engage in political conversations. However, the online disinhibition effect resulting from the ability to use pseudonymous identities may manifest in the form of offensive speech, consequently making political discussions more aggressive and polarizing than they already are. Such environments may result in harassment and self-censorship from its targets. In this paper, we present preliminary results from a large-scale temporal measurement aimed at quantifying offensiveness in online political discussions. To enable our measurements, we develop and evaluate an offensive speech classifier. We then use this classifier to quantify and compare offensiveness in the political and general contexts.

{"input": "Online discussions often derail into toxic exchanges between participants. Recent efforts mostly focused on detecting antisocial behavior after the fact, by analyzing single comments in isolation. To provide more timely notice to human moderators, a system needs to preemptively detect that a conversation is heading towards derailment before it actually turns toxic. This means modeling derailment as an emerging property of a conversation rather than as an isolated utterance-level event.  ::: Forecasting emerging conversational properties, however, poses several inherent modeling challenges. First, since conversations are dynamic, a forecasting model needs to capture the flow of the discussion, rather than properties of individual comments. Second, real conversations have an unknown horizon: they can end or derail at any time; thus a practical forecasting model needs to assess the risk in an online fashion, as the conversation develops. In this work we introduce a conversational forecasting model that learns an unsupervised representation of conversational dynamics and exploits it to predict future derailment as the conversation develops. By applying this model to two new diverse datasets of online conversations with labels for antisocial events, we show that it outperforms state-of-the-art systems at forecasting derailment.\nQuestion: What labels for antisocial events are available in datasets?", "output": "The Conversations Gone Awry dataset is labelled as either containing a personal attack from withint (i.e. hostile behavior by one user in the conversation directed towards another) or remaining civil throughout. The Reddit Change My View dataset is labelled with whether or not a coversation eventually had a comment removed by a moderator for violation of Rule 2: \"Don't be rude or hostile to others users.\". Explanation: The first dataset is an expanded version of the annotated Wikipedia conversations dataset from BIBREF9. This dataset uses carefully-controlled crowdsourced labels, strictly filtered to ensure the conversations are civil up to the moment of a personal attack. This is a useful property for the purposes of model analysis, and hence we focus on this as our primary dataset. However, we are conscious of the possibility that these strict labels may not fully capture the kind of behavior that moderators care about in practice. We therefore introduce a secondary dataset, constructed from the subreddit ChangeMyView (CMV) that does not use post-hoc annotations. Instead, the prediction task is to forecast whether the conversation will be subject to moderator action in the future."}

Second, to focus on the keywords of dependent clauses, we combine the model with a distant representation obtained from self-attention modules. Finally, due to the scarcity of labeled data, for which annotation is difficult and time-consuming, we also investigate and adapt Cross-View Training (CVT) as a semi-supervised learning technique, allowing us to utilize unlabeled data to improve the model representations.

{"input": "Recent work on adversarial examples has demonstrated that most natural inputs can be perturbed to fool even state-of-the-art machine learning systems. But does this happen for humans as well? In this work, we investigate: what fraction of natural instances of speech can be turned into\"illusions\"which either alter humans' perception or result in different people having significantly different perceptions? We first consider the McGurk effect, the phenomenon by which adding a carefully chosen video clip to the audio channel affects the viewer's perception of what is said (McGurk and MacDonald, 1976). We obtain empirical estimates that a significant fraction of both words and sentences occurring in natural speech have some susceptibility to this effect. We also learn models for predicting McGurk illusionability. Finally we demonstrate that the Yanny or Laurel auditory illusion (Pressnitzer et al., 2018) is not an isolated occurrence by generating several very different new instances. We believe that the surprising density of illusionable natural speech warrants further investigation, from the perspectives of both security and cognitive science.

The consistent groups come from the original training data; the inconsistent groups are obtained by sampling round-trip translations for each isolated sentence. We show that this approach successfully imitates inconsistencies we aim to fix: using contrastive evaluation, we show large improvements in the translation of several contextual phenomena in an English-Russian translation task, as well as improvements in the BLEU score.

{"input": "This work presents an exploration and imitation-learning-based agent capable of state-of-the-art performance in playing text-based computer games. Text-based computer games describe their world to the player through natural language and expect the player to interact with the game using text. These games are of interest as they can be seen as a testbed for language understanding, problem-solving, and language generation by artificial agents. Moreover, they provide a learning environment in which these skills can be acquired through interactions with an environment rather than using fixed corpora. One aspect that makes these games particularly challenging for learning agents is the combinatorially large action space. Existing methods for solving text-based games are limited to games that are either very simple or have an action space restricted to a predetermined set of admissible actions. In this work, we propose to use the exploration approach of Go-Explore for solving text-based games. More specifically, in an initial exploration phase, we first extract trajectories with high rewards, after which we train a policy to solve the game by imitating these trajectories. Our experiments show that this approach outperforms existing solutions in solving text-based games, and it is more sample efficient in terms of the number of interactions with the environment. Moreover, we show that the learned policy can generalize better than existing solutions to unseen games without using any restriction on the action space.\nQuestion: How better does new approach behave than existing solutions?", "output": "On the other hand, phase 1 of Go-Explore finds an optimal trajectory with approximately half the interactions with the environment.

In Go-Explore we also count the actions used to restore the environment to a selected cell, i.e. to bring the agent to the state represented in the selected cell. This allows a one-to-one comparison of the exploration efficiency between Go-Explore and algorithms that use a count-based reward in text-based games. Importantly, BIBREF8 showed that DQN and DRQN, without such counting rewards, could never find a successful trajectory in hard games such as the ones used in our experiments. Figure FIGREF17 shows the number of interactions with the environment (frames) versus the maximum score obtained, averaged over 10 games of the same difficulty. As shown by BIBREF8, DRQN++ finds a trajectory with the maximum score faster than to DQN++. On the other hand, phase 1 of Go-Explore finds an optimal trajectory with approximately half the interactions with the environment. Moreover, the trajectory length found by Go-Explore is always optimal (i.e. 30 steps) whereas both DQN++ and DRQN++ have an average length of 38 and 42 respectively."}

These results demonstrate both the relative effectiveness of training a Seq2Seq model on Go-Explore trajectories, but they also indicate that additional effort needed for designing reinforcement learning algorithms that effectively generalize to unseen games."}

Previous work has studied various rule- or learning-based approaches designed for specific types of data manipulation.

We train a model to automatically predict from a visual question whether a crowd would agree on a single answer.

(a) For a batch of visual questions, our system first produces a relative ordering using the predicted confidence in whether a crowd would agree on an answer (upper half). Then, the system allocates a minimum number of annotations to all visual questions (bottom, left half) and then the extra available human budget to visual questions most confidently predicted to lead to crowd disagreement (bottom, right half).

{"input": "One of the challenges in large-scale information retrieval (IR) is to develop fine-grained and domain-specific methods to answer natural language questions. Despite the availability of numerous sources and datasets for answer retrieval, Question Answering (QA) remains a challenging problem due to the difficulty of the question understanding and answer extraction tasks. One of the promising tracks investigated in QA is to map new questions to formerly answered questions that are `similar'. In this paper, we propose a novel QA approach based on Recognizing Question Entailment (RQE) and we describe the QA system and resources that we built and evaluated on real medical questions. First, we compare machine learning and deep learning methods for RQE using different kinds of datasets, including textual inference, question similarity and entailment in both the open and clinical domains. Second, we combine IR models with the best RQE method to select entailed questions and rank the retrieved answers. To study the end-to-end QA approach, we built the MedQuAD collection of 47,457 question-answer pairs from trusted medical sources, that we introduce and share in the scope of this paper. Following the evaluation process used in TREC 2017 LiveQA, we find that our approach exceeds the best results of the medical task with a 29.8% increase over the best official score. The evaluation results also support the relevance of question entailment for QA and highlight the effectiveness of combining IR and RQE for future QA efforts.

Word2vec embeds word semantic structure into vectors, where the angle between vectors indicates the meaningful similarity between words. To measure the similarity between texts, we propose the novel concept of word subspace, which can represent the intrinsic variability of features in a set of word vectors. Through this concept, it is possible to model text from word vectors while holding semantic information. To incorporate the word frequency directly in the subspace model, we further extend the word subspace to the term-frequency (TF) weighted word subspace.

{"input": "Automated analysis of clinical notes is attracting increasing attention. However, there has not been much work on medical term abbreviation disambiguation. Such abbreviations are abundant, and highly ambiguous, in clinical documents. One of the main obstacles is the lack of large scale, balance labeled data sets. To address the issue, we propose a few-shot learning approach to take advantage of limited labeled data. Specifically, a neural topic-attention model is applied to learn improved contextualized sentence representations for medical term abbreviation disambiguation. Another vital issue is that the existing scarce annotations are noisy and missing. We re-examine and correct an existing dataset for training and collect a test set to evaluate the models fairly especially for rare senses. We train our model on the training set which contains 30 abbreviation terms as categories (on average, 479 samples and 3.24 classes in each term) selected from a public abbreviation disambiguation dataset, and then test on a manually-created balanced dataset (each class in each term has 15 samples).

{"input": "Automated analysis of clinical notes is attracting increasing attention. However, there has not been much work on medical term abbreviation disambiguation. Such abbreviations are abundant, and highly ambiguous, in clinical documents. One of the main obstacles is the lack of large scale, balance labeled data sets. To address the issue, we propose a few-shot learning approach to take advantage of limited labeled data. Specifically, a neural topic-attention model is applied to learn improved contextualized sentence representations for medical term abbreviation disambiguation. Another vital issue is that the existing scarce annotations are noisy and missing. We re-examine and correct an existing dataset for training and collect a test set to evaluate the models fairly especially for rare senses. We train our model on the training set which contains 30 abbreviation terms as categories (on average, 479 samples and 3.24 classes in each term) selected from a public abbreviation disambiguation dataset, and then test on a manually-created balanced dataset (each class in each term has 15 samples). We show that enhancing the sentence representation with topic information improves the performance on small-scale unbalanced training datasets by a large margin, compared to a number of baseline models.\nQuestion: To what baseline models is proposed model compared?", "output": "support vector machine classifier (SVM). Explanation: TF-IDF: We applied TF-IDF features as inputs to four classifiers: support vector machine classifier (SVM), logistic regression classifier (LR), Naive Bayes classifier (NB) and random forest (RF); CNN: We followed the same architecture as BIBREF9; LSTM: We applied an LSTM model BIBREF20 to classify the sentences with pre-trained word embeddings;LSTM-soft: We then added a soft-attention BIBREF21 layer on top of the LSTM model where we computed soft alignment scores over each of the hidden states; LSTM-self: We applied a self-attention layer BIBREF22 to LSTM model."}

{"input": "Learning word representations has garnered greater attention in the recent past due to its diverse text applications. Word embeddings encapsulate the syntactic and semantic regularities of sentences. Modelling word embedding as multi-sense gaussian mixture distributions, will additionally capture uncertainty and polysemy of words.

The KL divergence based energy function provides a better distance metric which can effectively capture entailment and distribution similarity among the words.

{"input": "This paper analyzes the gender representation in four major corpora of French broadcast. These corpora being widely used within the speech processing community, they are a primary material for training automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems. As gender bias has been highlighted in numerous natural language processing (NLP) applications, we study the impact of the gender imbalance in TV and radio broadcast on the performance of an ASR system. This analysis shows that women are under-represented in our data in terms of speakers and speech turns. We introduce the notion of speaker role to refine our analysis and find that women are even fewer within the Anchor category corresponding to prominent speakers. The disparity of available data for both gender causes performance to decrease on women. However this global trend can be counterbalanced for speaker who are used to speak in the media when sufficient amount of data is available.\nQuestion: What tasks did they use to evaluate performance for male and female speakers?", "output": "ASR. Explanation: In this paper, we first highlight the importance of TV and radio broadcast as a source of data for ASR, and the potential impact it can have. We then perform a statistical analysis of gender representation in a data set composed of four state-of-the-art corpora of French broadcast, widely used within the speech community. Finally we question the impact of such a representation on the systems developed on this data, through the perspective of an ASR system."}

{"input": "This article presents a preliminary approach towards characterizing political fake news on Twitter through the analysis of their meta-data. In particular, we focus on more than 1.5M tweets collected on the day of the election of Donald Trump as 45th president of the United States of America. We use the meta-data embedded within those tweets in order to look for differences between tweets containing fake news and tweets not containing them. Specifically, we perform our analysis only on tweets that went viral, by studying proxies for users' exposure to the tweets, by characterizing accounts spreading fake news, and by looking at their polarization. We found significant differences on the distribution of followers, the number of URLs on tweets, and the verification of the users.\nQuestion: What were their distribution results?", "output": "Distributions of Followers, Friends and URLs are significantly different between the set of tweets containing fake news and those non containing them, but for Favourites, Mentions, Media, Retweets and Hashtags they are not significantly different.

{"input": "For conversational AI and virtual assistants to communicate with humans in a realistic way, they must exhibit human characteristics such as expression of emotion and personality. Current attempts toward constructing human-like dialogue agents have presented significant difficulties. We propose Human Level Attributes (HLAs) based on tropes as the basis of a method for learning dialogue agents that can imitate the personalities of fictional characters. Tropes are characteristics of fictional personalities that are observed recurrently and determined by viewers' impressions. By combining detailed HLA data with dialogue data for specific characters, we present a dataset that models character profiles and gives dialogue agents the ability to learn characters' language styles through their HLAs. We then introduce a three-component system, ALOHA (which stands for Artificial Learning On Human Attributes), that combines character space mapping, character community detection, and language style retrieval to build a character (or personality) specific language model. Our preliminary experiments demonstrate that ALOHA, combined with our proposed dataset, can outperform baseline models at identifying correct dialogue responses of any chosen target character, and is stable regardless of the character's identity, genre of the show, and context of the dialogue.\nQuestion: How many different characters were in dataset?", "output": "45,821 characters.

We then introduce a three-component system, ALOHA (which stands for Artificial Learning On Human Attributes), that combines character space mapping, character community detection, and language style retrieval to build a character (or personality) specific language model. Our preliminary experiments demonstrate that ALOHA, combined with our proposed dataset, can outperform baseline models at identifying correct dialogue responses of any chosen target character, and is stable regardless of the character's identity, genre of the show, and context of the dialogue.\nQuestion: How does dataset model character's profiles?", "output": "attributes are determined by human viewers and their impressions of the characters, and are correlated with human-like characteristics. Explanation: We collect HLA data from TV Tropes BIBREF3, a knowledge-based website dedicated to pop culture, containing information on a plethora of characters from a variety of sources. Similar to Wikipedia, its content is provided and edited collaboratively by a massive user-base. These attributes are determined by human viewers and their impressions of the characters, and are correlated with human-like characteristics. We believe that TV Tropes is better for our purpose of fictional character modeling than data sources used in works such as BIBREF25 shuster2019engaging because TV Tropes' content providers are rewarded for correctly providing content through community acknowledgement."}

{"input": "In this paper, we propose a novel pretraining-based encoder-decoder framework, which can generate the output sequence based on the input sequence in a two-stage manner. For the encoder of our model, we encode the input sequence into context representations using BERT. For the decoder, there are two stages in our model, in the first stage, we use a Transformer-based decoder to generate a draft output sequence. In the second stage, we mask each word of the draft sequence and feed it to BERT, then by combining the input sequence and the draft representation generated by BERT, we use a Transformer-based decoder to predict the refined word for each masked position. To the best of our knowledge, our approach is the first method which applies the BERT into text generation tasks. As the first step in this direction, we evaluate our proposed method on the text summarization task.

Explanation: All corpora provide datasets/splits for answer selection, whereas only (WikiQA, SQuAD) and (WikiQA, SelQA) provide datasets for answer extraction and answer triggering, respectively. SQuAD is much larger in size although questions in this corpus are often paraphrased multiple times. On the contrary, SQuAD's average candidates per question ( INLINEFORM0 ) is the smallest because SQuAD extracts answer candidates from paragraphs whereas the others extract them from sections or infoboxes that consist of bigger contexts. Although InfoboxQA is larger than WikiQA or SelQA, the number of token types ( INLINEFORM1 ) in InfoboxQA is smaller than those two, due to the repetitive nature of infoboxes.\n\nAll corpora show similar average answer candidate lengths ( INLINEFORM0 ), except for InfoboxQA where each line in the infobox is considered a candidate. SelQA and SQuAD show similar average question lengths ( INLINEFORM1 ) because of the similarity between their annotation schemes. It is not surprising that WikiQA's average question length is the smallest, considering their questions are taken from search queries. InfoboxQA's average question length is relatively small, due to the restricted information that can be asked from the infoboxes. InfoboxQA and WikiQA show the least question-answer word overlaps over questions and answers ( INLINEFORM2 and INLINEFORM3 in Table TABREF2 ), respectively. In terms of the F1-score for overlapping words ( INLINEFORM4 ), SQuAD gives the least portion of overlaps between question-answer pairs although WikiQA comes very close."}

{"input": "Medication recommendation is an important healthcare application. It is commonly formulated as a temporal prediction task. Hence, most existing works only utilize longitudinal electronic health records (EHRs) from a small number of patients with multiple visits ignoring a large number of patients with a single visit (selection bias).

To address these challenges, we propose G-BERT, a new model to combine the power of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) for medical code representation and medication recommendation. We use GNNs to represent the internal hierarchical structures of medical codes. Then we integrate the GNN representation into a transformer-based visit encoder and pre-train it on EHR data from patients only with a single visit. The pre-trained visit encoder and representation are then fine-tuned for downstream predictive tasks on longitudinal EHRs from patients with multiple visits.

The experimental results showed that the proposed generators not only consistently outperform the previous methods across all the NLG domains but also show an ability to generalize from a new, unseen domain and learn from multi-domain datasets.\nQuestion: Does the model evaluated on NLG datasets or dialog datasets?", "output": "NLG datasets. Explanation: We assessed the proposed models on four different NLG domains: finding a restaurant, finding a hotel, buying a laptop, and buying a television. The Restaurant and Hotel were collected in BIBREF4 , while the Laptop and TV datasets have been released by BIBREF22 with a much larger input space but only one training example for each DA so that the system must learn partial realization of concepts and be able to recombine and apply them to unseen DAs."}
{"input": "Tree-structured neural networks have proven to be effective in learning semantic representations by exploiting syntactic information. In spite of their success, most existing models suffer from the underfitting problem: they recursively use the same shared compositional function throughout the whole compositional process and lack expressive power due to inability to capture the richness of compositionality. In this paper, we address this issue by introducing the dynamic compositional neural networks over tree structure (DC-TreeNN), in which the compositional function is dynamically generated by a meta network. The role of meta-network is to capture the metaknowledge across the different compositional rules and formulate them. Experimental results on two typical tasks show the effectiveness of the proposed models.\nQuestion: What tasks do they experiment with?", "output": "text classification and text semantic matching. Explanation: We evaluate our models on two typical tasks: text classification and text semantic matching."}
{"input": "Singing voice conversion is to convert a singer's voice to another one's voice without changing singing content. Recent work shows that unsupervised singing voice conversion can be achieved with an autoencoder-based approach [1]. However, the converted singing voice can be easily out of key, showing that the existing approach can not model the pitch information precisely. In this paper, we propose to advance the existing unsupervised singing voice conversion method proposed in [1] to achieve more accurate pitch translation and flexible pitch manipulation. Specifically, the proposed PitchNet added an adversarially trained pitch regression network to enforce the encoder network to learn pitch invariant phoneme representation, and a separate module to feed pitch extracted from the source audio to the decoder network. Our evaluation shows that the proposed method can greatly improve the quality of the converted singing voice (2.92 vs 3.75 in MOS). We also demonstrate that the pitch of converted singing can be easily controlled during generation by changing the levels of extracted pitch before passing it to the decoder network.\nQuestion: How is the quality of singing voice measured?", "output": "To compare the conversions between USVC and PitchNet, we employed an automatic evaluation score and a human evaluation score.. Explanation: To compare the conversions between USVC and PitchNet, we employed an automatic evaluation score and a human evaluation score."}
{"input": "LSTMs are powerful tools for modeling contextual information, as evidenced by their success at the task of language modeling. However, modeling contexts in very high dimensional space can lead to poor generalizability. We introduce the Pyramidal Recurrent Unit (PRU), which enables learning representations in high dimensional space with more generalization power and fewer parameters. PRUs replace the linear transformation in LSTMs with more sophisticated interactions including pyramidal and grouped linear transformations. This architecture gives strong results on word-level language modeling while reducing the number of parameters significantly. In particular, PRU improves the perplexity of a recent state-of-the-art language model Merity et al. (2018) by up to 1.3 points while learning 15-20% fewer parameters. For similar number of model parameters, PRU outperforms all previous RNN models that exploit different gating mechanisms and transformations. We provide a detailed examination of the PRU and its behavior on the language modeling tasks. Our code is open-source and available at https://sacmehta.github.io/PRU/\nQuestion: what data did they use?", "output": "Penn Treebank.

{"input": "Both human and machine translation play a central role in cross-lingual transfer learning: many multilingual datasets have been created through professional translation services, and using machine translation to translate either the test set or the training set is a widely used transfer technique. In this paper, we show that such translation process can introduce subtle artifacts that have a notable impact in existing cross-lingual models. For instance, in natural language inference, translating the premise and the hypothesis independently can reduce the lexical overlap between them, which current models are highly sensitive to. We show that some previous findings in cross-lingual transfer learning need to be reconsidered in the light of this phenomenon. Based on the gained insights, we also improve the state-of-the-art in XNLI for the translate-test and zero-shot approaches by 4.3 and 2.8 points, respectively.\nQuestion: What are examples of these artificats?", "output": "the degree of lexical overlap between them. Explanation: Instead, our analysis reveals that this behavior is caused by subtle artifacts arising from the translation process itself. In particular, we show that translating different parts of each instance separately (e.g. the premise and the hypothesis in NLI) can alter superficial patterns in the data (e.g. the degree of lexical overlap between them), which severely affects the generalization ability of current models.

{"input": "Modern NLP systems require high-quality annotated data. In specialized domains, expert annotations may be prohibitively expensive. An alternative is to rely on crowdsourcing to reduce costs at the risk of introducing noise. In this paper we demonstrate that directly modeling instance difficulty can be used to improve model performance, and to route instances to appropriate annotators. Our difficulty prediction model combines two learned representations: a `universal' encoder trained on out-of-domain data, and a task-specific encoder. Experiments on a complex biomedical information extraction task using expert and lay annotators show that: (i) simply excluding from the training data instances predicted to be difficult yields a small boost in performance; (ii) using difficulty scores to weight instances during training provides further, consistent gains; (iii) assigning instances predicted to be difficult to domain experts is an effective strategy for task routing. Our experiments confirm the expectation that for specialized tasks expert annotations are higher quality than crowd labels, and hence preferable to obtain if practical. Moreover, augmenting small amounts of expert data with a larger set of lay annotations leads to further improvements in model performance.\nQuestion: How much higher quality is the resulting annotated data?", "output": "improvement when the difficult subset with expert annotations is mixed with the remaining crowd annotation is 3.5 F1 score, much larger than when a random set of expert annotations are added.

Human evaluation shows that 60.8% of samples generated by our model are sensational, which is significantly better than the Pointer-Gen baseline and other RL models.\nQuestion: How is sensationalism scorer trained?", "output": "by classifying sensational and non-sensational headlines using a one-layer CNN with a binary cross entropy loss $L_{\\text{sen}}$. Explanation: We then train the sensationalism scorer by classifying sensational and non-sensational headlines using a one-layer CNN with a binary cross entropy loss $L_{\\text{sen}}$. Firstly, 1-D convolution is used to extract word features from the input embeddings of a headline. This is followed by a ReLU activation layer and a max-pooling layer along the time dimension. All features from different channels are concatenated together and projected to the sensationalism score by adding another fully connected layer with sigmoid activation. Binary cross entropy is used to compute the loss $L_{\\text{sen}}$."}

Explanation: Results and ablations ::: Ablation studies\nTo understand the impact of some hyperparameters on performance, we conducted additional experiments on the Reuters, Polarity, and IMDB datasets, with the non-hierarchical version of MPAD. Results are shown in Table TABREF29.\n\nNumber of MP iterations. First, we varied the number of message passing iterations from 1 to 4. We can clearly see in Table TABREF29 that having more iterations improves performance. We attribute this to the fact that we are reading out at each iteration from 1 to $T$ (see Eq. DISPLAY_FORM18), which enables the final graph representation to encode a mixture of low-level and high-level features. Indeed, in initial experiments involving readout at $t$=$T$ only, setting $T\\ge 2$ was always decreasing performance, despite the GRU-based updates (Eq. DISPLAY_FORM14). These results were consistent with that of BIBREF53 and BIBREF9, who both are reading out only at $t$=$T$ too. We hypothesize that node features at $T\\ge 2$ are too diffuse to be entirely relied upon during readout. More precisely, initially at $t$=0, node representations capture information about words, at $t$=1, about their 1-hop neighborhood (bigrams), at $t$=2, about compositions of bigrams, etc. Thus, pretty quickly, node features become general and diffuse. In such cases, considering also the lower-level, more precise features of the earlier iterations when reading out may be necessary."}

{"input": "In this paper, we propose a novel mechanism for enriching the feature vector, for the task of sarcasm detection, with cognitive features extracted from eye-movement patterns of human readers. Sarcasm detection has been a challenging research problem, and its importance for NLP applications such as review summarization, dialog systems and sentiment analysis is well recognized. Sarcasm can often be traced to incongruity that becomes apparent as the full sentence unfolds. This presence of incongruity- implicit or explicit- affects the way readers eyes move through the text. We observe the difference in the behaviour of the eye, while reading sarcastic and non sarcastic sentences. Motivated by his observation, we augment traditional linguistic and stylistic features for sarcasm detection with the cognitive features obtained from readers eye movement data. We perform statistical classification using the enhanced feature set so obtained. The augmented cognitive features improve sarcasm detection by 3.7% (in terms of F-score), over the performance of the best reported system.\nQuestion: What other evaluation metrics are looked at?", "output": "F-score.
