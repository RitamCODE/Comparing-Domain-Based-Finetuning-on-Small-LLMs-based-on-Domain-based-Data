{"input": "End-to-end task-oriented dialog models have achieved promising performance on collaborative tasks where users willingly coordinate with the system to complete a given task. While in non-collaborative settings, for example, negotiation and persuasion, users and systems do not share a common goal. As a result, compared to collaborate tasks, people use social content to build rapport and trust in these non-collaborative settings in order to advance their goals. To handle social content, we introduce a hierarchical intent annotation scheme, which can be generalized to different non-collaborative dialog tasks. Building upon TransferTransfo (Wolf et al. 2019), we propose an end-to-end neural network model to generate diverse coherent responses. Our model utilizes intent and semantic slots as the intermediate sentence representation to guide the generation process. In addition, we design a filter to select appropriate responses based on whether these intermediate representations fit the designed task and conversation constraints. Our non-collaborative dialog model guides users to complete the task while simultaneously keeps them engaged.

{"input": "BERT is a cutting-edge language representation model pre-trained by a large corpus, which achieves superior performances on various natural language understanding tasks. However, a major blocking issue of applying BERT to online services is that it is memory-intensive and leads to unsatisfactory latency of user requests, raising the necessity of model compression. Existing solutions leverage the knowledge distillation framework to learn a smaller model that imitates the behaviors of BERT. However, the training procedure of knowledge distillation is expensive itself as it requires sufficient training data to imitate the teacher model. In this paper, we address this issue by proposing a hybrid solution named LadaBERT (Lightweight adaptation of BERT through hybrid model compression), which combines the advantages of different model compression methods, including weight pruning, matrix factorization and knowledge distillation.

{"input": "Detecting controversy in general web pages is a daunting task, but increasingly essential to efficiently moderate discussions and effectively filter problematic content. Unfortunately, controversies occur across many topics and domains, with great changes over time. This paper investigates neural classifiers as a more robust methodology for controversy detection in general web pages. Current models have often cast controversy detection on general web pages as Wikipedia linking, or exact lexical matching tasks. The diverse and changing nature of controversies suggest that semantic approaches are better able to detect controversy. We train neural networks that can capture semantic information from texts using weak signal data. By leveraging the semantic properties of word embeddings we robustly improve on existing controversy detection methods. To evaluate model stability over time and to unseen topics, we asses model performance under varying training conditions to test cross-temporal, cross-topic, cross-domain performance and annotator congruence.

{"input": "The translation of pronouns presents a special challenge to machine translation to this day, since it often requires context outside the current sentence. Recent work on models that have access to information across sentence boundaries has seen only moderate improvements in terms of automatic evaluation metrics such as BLEU. However, metrics that quantify the overall translation quality are ill-equipped to measure gains from additional context. We argue that a different kind of evaluation is needed to assess how well models translate inter-sentential phenomena such as pronouns. This paper therefore presents a test suite of contrastive translations focused specifically on the translation of pronouns. Furthermore, we perform experiments with several context-aware models. We show that, while gains in BLEU are moderate for those systems, they outperform baselines by a large margin in terms of accuracy on our contrastive test set.

{"input": "In this work we focus on transferring supervision signals of natural language generation (NLG) tasks between multiple languages. We propose to pretrain the encoder and the decoder of a sequence-to-sequence model under both monolingual and cross-lingual settings. The pre-training objective encourages the model to represent different languages in the shared space, so that we can conduct zero-shot cross-lingual transfer. After the pre-training procedure, we use monolingual data to fine-tune the pre-trained model on downstream NLG tasks. Then the sequence-to-sequence model trained in a single language can be directly evaluated beyond that language (i.e., accepting multi-lingual input and producing multi-lingual output). Experimental results on question generation and abstractive summarization show that our model outperforms the machine-translation-based pipeline methods for zero-shot cross-lingual generation.

We propose to pretrain the encoder and the decoder of a sequence-to-sequence model under both monolingual and cross-lingual settings. The pre-training objective encourages the model to represent different languages in the shared space, so that we can conduct zero-shot cross-lingual transfer. After the pre-training procedure, we use monolingual data to fine-tune the pre-trained model on downstream NLG tasks. Then the sequence-to-sequence model trained in a single language can be directly evaluated beyond that language (i.e., accepting multi-lingual input and producing multi-lingual output). Experimental results on question generation and abstractive summarization show that our model outperforms the machine-translation-based pipeline methods for zero-shot cross-lingual generation.

We find that the supersense categories are well-suited to Chinese adpositions despite syntactic differences from English. On a Mandarin translation of The Little Prince, we achieve high inter-annotator agreement and analyze semantic correspondences of adposition tokens in bitext.\nQuestion: What is the size of the corpus?", "prediction": "How many tokens are there?\n<blockquote>Table 1: Number of adpositions in the corpus and the number of tokens per adposition.

{"input": "Distantly supervised relation extraction intrinsically suffers from noisy labels due to the strong assumption of distant supervision. Most prior works adopt a selective attention mechanism over sentences in a bag to denoise from wrongly labeled data, which however could be incompetent when there is only one sentence in a bag. In this paper, we propose a brand-new light-weight neural framework to address the distantly supervised relation extraction problem and alleviate the defects in previous selective attention framework. Specifically, in the proposed framework, 1) we use an entity-aware word embedding method to integrate both relative position information and head/tail entity embeddings, aiming to highlight the essence of entities for this task; 2) we develop a self-attention mechanism to capture the rich contextual dependencies as a complement for local dependencies captured by piecewise CNN; and 3) instead of using selective attention, we design a pooling-equipped gate, which is based on rich contextual representations, as an aggregator to generate bag-level representation for final relation classification. Compared to selective attention, one major advantage of the proposed gating mechanism is that, it performs stably and promisingly even if only one sentence appears in a bag and thus keeps the consistency across all training examples.

{"input": "Social media, especially Twitter, is being increasingly used for research with predictive analytics. In social media studies, natural language processing (NLP) techniques are used in conjunction with expert-based, manual and qualitative analyses. However, social media data are unstructured and must undergo complex manipulation for research use. The manual annotation is the most resource and time-consuming process that multiple expert raters have to reach consensus on every item, but is essential to create gold-standard datasets for training NLP-based machine learning classifiers. To reduce the burden of the manual annotation, yet maintaining its reliability, we devised a crowdsourcing pipeline combined with active learning strategies. We demonstrated its effectiveness through a case study that identifies job loss events from individual tweets. We used Amazon Mechanical Turk platform to recruit annotators from the Internet and designed a number of quality control measures to assure annotation accuracy. We evaluated 4 different active learning strategies (i.e., least confident, entropy, vote entropy, and Kullback-Leibler divergence). The active learning strategies aim at reducing the number of tweets needed to reach a desired performance of automated classification. Results show that crowdsourcing is useful to create high-quality annotations and active learning helps in reducing the number of required tweets, although there was no substantial difference among the strategies tested.\nQuestion: Which was the most helpful strategy?", "prediction": "How many tweets were needed to reach a desired performance?\n< Explanation: The most helpful strategy was entropy.

{"input": "Social media, especially Twitter, is being increasingly used for research with predictive analytics. In social media studies, natural language processing (NLP) techniques are used in conjunction with expert-based, manual and qualitative analyses. However, social media data are unstructured and must undergo complex manipulation for research use. The manual annotation is the most resource and time-consuming process that multiple expert raters have to reach consensus on every item, but is essential to create gold-standard datasets for training NLP-based machine learning classifiers. To reduce the burden of the manual annotation, yet maintaining its reliability, we devised a crowdsourcing pipeline combined with active learning strategies. We demonstrated its effectiveness through a case study that identifies job loss events from individual tweets. We used Amazon Mechanical Turk platform to recruit annotators from the Internet and designed a number of quality control measures to assure annotation accuracy. We evaluated 4 different active learning strategies (i.e., least confident, entropy, vote entropy, and Kullback-Leibler divergence). The active learning strategies aim at reducing the number of tweets needed to reach a desired performance of automated classification. Results show that crowdsourcing is useful to create high-quality annotations and active learning helps in reducing the number of required tweets, although there was no substantial difference among the strategies tested.\nQuestion: How large is their tweets dataset?", "prediction": "What is the size of the dataset?\n< Explanation: The Twitter dataset contains 1,000,000 tweets.

{"input": "Recent studies have consistently given positive hints that morphology is helpful in enriching word embeddings. In this paper, we argue that Chinese word embeddings can be substantially enriched by the morphological information hidden in characters which is reflected not only in strokes order sequentially, but also in character glyphs spatially. Then, we propose a novel Dual-channel Word Embedding (DWE) model to realize the joint learning of sequential and spatial information of characters. Through the evaluation on both word similarity and word analogy tasks, our model shows its rationality and superiority in modelling the morphology of Chinese.\nQuestion: How much data do they use to train the embeddings?", "prediction": "What are the evaluation metrics?\n< Explanation: We use 100000 words from the Chinese WordNet corpus as training data.

{"input": "The collection of narrative spontaneous reports is an irreplaceable source for the prompt detection of suspected adverse drug reactions (ADRs): qualified domain experts manually revise a huge amount of narrative descriptions and then encode texts according to MedDRA standard terminology. The manual annotation of narrative documents with medical terminology is a subtle and expensive task, since the number of reports is growing up day-by-day. MagiCoder, a Natural Language Processing algorithm, is proposed for the automatic encoding of free-text descriptions into MedDRA terms. MagiCoder procedure is efficient in terms of computational complexity (in particular, it is linear in the size of the narrative input and the terminology). We tested it on a large dataset of about 4500 manually revised reports, by performing an automated comparison between human and MagiCoder revisions. For the current base version of MagiCoder, we measured: on short descriptions, an average recall of $86\\%$ and an average precision of $88\\%$; on medium-long descriptions (up to 255 characters), an average recall of $64\\%$ and an average precision of $63\\%$. From a practical point of view, MagiCoder reduces the time required for encoding ADR reports. Pharmacologists have simply to review and validate the MagiCoder terms proposed by the application, instead of choosing the right terms among the 70K low level terms of MedDRA.

{"input": "Neural machine translation (NMT) suffers a performance deficiency when a limited vocabulary fails to cover the source or target side adequately, which happens frequently when dealing with morphologically rich languages. To address this problem, previous work focused on adjusting translation granularity or expanding the vocabulary size. However, morphological information is relatively under-considered in NMT architectures, which may further improve translation quality. We propose a novel method, which can not only reduce data sparsity but also model morphology through a simple but effective mechanism. By predicting the stem and suffix separately during decoding, our system achieves an improvement of up to 1.98 BLEU compared with previous work on English to Russian translation. Our method is orthogonal to different NMT architectures and stably gains improvements on various domains.\nQuestion: what is the previous work they are comparing to?", "prediction": "Answer: previous work on English to Russian translation\nPrevious work on English to Russian translation\nPrevious work on English to Russian translation\nPrevious work on English to Russian translation\nPrevious work on English to Russian translation\nPrevious work on English to Russian translation\nPrevious work on English to Russian translation\nPrevious work on English to Russian translation\nPrevious work on English to Russian translation\nPrevious work on English to Russian translation\nPrevious work on English to Russian translation\nPrevious work on English to Russian translation\nPrevious work on English to Russian translation\nPrevious work on English to Russian translation\nPrevious work on English to Russian translation\nPrevious work on English to"}

We suggest that the distribution is a sub-optimal choice, and propose to use a sub-sampled unigram distribution for better negative sampling. Our contributions include: (1) proposing the concept of semantics quantification and deriving a suitable sub-sampling rate for the proposed distribution adaptive to different training corpora; (2) demonstrating the advantages of our approach in both negative sampling and noise contrastive estimation by extensive evaluation tasks; and (3) proposing a semantics weighted model for the MSR sentence completion task, resulting in considerable improvements.

{"input": "Word embedding or Word2Vec has been successful in offering semantics for text words learned from the context of words. Audio Word2Vec was shown to offer phonetic structures for spoken words (signal segments for words) learned from signals within spoken words. This paper proposes a two-stage framework to perform phonetic-and-semantic embedding on spoken words considering the context of the spoken words. Stage 1 performs phonetic embedding with speaker characteristics disentangled. Stage 2 then performs semantic embedding in addition. We further propose to evaluate the phonetic-and-semantic nature of the audio embeddings obtained in Stage 2 by parallelizing with text embeddings. In general, phonetic structure and semantics inevitably disturb each other. For example the words\"brother\"and\"sister\"are close in semantics but very different in phonetic structure, while the words\"brother\"and\"bother\"are in the other way around. But phonetic-and-semantic embedding is attractive, as shown in the initial experiments on spoken document retrieval. Not only spoken documents including the spoken query can be retrieved based on the phonetic structures, but spoken documents semantically related to the query but not including the query can also be retrieved based on the semantics.\nQuestion: What language is used for the experiments?", "prediction": "How is the dataset generated?\n< Explanation: We use English as the target language.

{"input": "Previous work has shown that for low-resource source languages, automatic speech-to-text translation (AST) can be improved by pretraining an end-to-end model on automatic speech recognition (ASR) data from a high-resource language. However, it is not clear what factors --e.g., language relatedness or size of the pretraining data-- yield the biggest improvements, or whether pretraining can be effectively combined with other methods such as data augmentation. Here, we experiment with pretraining on datasets of varying sizes, including languages related and unrelated to the AST source language. We find that the best predictor of final AST performance is the word error rate of the pretrained ASR model, and that differences in ASR/AST performance correlate with how phonetic information is encoded in the later RNN layers of our model.

{"input": "This paper describes a general, scalable, end-to-end framework that uses the generative adversarial network (GAN) objective to enable robust speech recognition. Encoders trained with the proposed approach enjoy improved invariance by learning to map noisy audio to the same embedding space as that of clean audio.

While these policies are effective for many tasks, interpretation of their induced communication strategies has remained a challenge. Here we propose to interpret agents' messages by translating them. Unlike in typical machine translation problems, we have no parallel data to learn from. Instead we develop a translation model based on the insight that agent messages and natural language strings mean the same thing if they induce the same belief about the world in a listener. We present theoretical guarantees and empirical evidence that our approach preserves both the semantics and pragmatics of messages by ensuring that players communicating through a translation layer do not suffer a substantial loss in reward relative to players with a common language.\nQuestion: What dataset is used?", "prediction": "How is the dataset divided?\n< Explanation: We use the 2016-2017 DeepMind OpenAI Gym dataset (OpenAI, 2017).

Achieving high accuracy with these end-to-end models without a large amount of training data is difficult. We propose a method to reduce the data requirements of end-to-end SLU in which the model is first pre-trained to predict words and phonemes, thus learning good features for SLU.

{"input": "Direct computer vision based-nutrient content estimation is a demanding task, due to deformation and occlusions of ingredients, as well as high intra-class and low inter-class variability between meal classes. In order to tackle these issues, we propose a system for recipe retrieval from images. The recipe information can subsequently be used to estimate the nutrient content of the meal. In this study, we utilize the multi-modal Recipe1M dataset, which contains over 1 million recipes accompanied by over 13 million images. The proposed model can operate as a first step in an automatic pipeline for the estimation of nutrition content by supporting hints related to ingredient and instruction. Through self-attention, our model can directly process raw recipe text, making the upstream instruction sentence embedding process redundant and thus reducing training time, while providing desirable retrieval results. Furthermore, we propose the use of an ingredient attention mechanism, in order to gain insight into which instructions, parts of instructions or single instruction words are of importance for processing a single ingredient within a certain recipe. Attention-based recipe text encoding contributes to solving the issue of high intra-class/low inter-class variability by focusing on preparation steps specific to the meal. The experimental results demonstrate the potential of such a system for recipe retrieval from images.

{"input": "Direct computer vision based-nutrient content estimation is a demanding task, due to deformation and occlusions of ingredients, as well as high intra-class and low inter-class variability between meal classes. In order to tackle these issues, we propose a system for recipe retrieval from images. The recipe information can subsequently be used to estimate the nutrient content of the meal. In this study, we utilize the multi-modal Recipe1M dataset, which contains over 1 million recipes accompanied by over 13 million images. The proposed model can operate as a first step in an automatic pipeline for the estimation of nutrition content by supporting hints related to ingredient and instruction. Through self-attention, our model can directly process raw recipe text, making the upstream instruction sentence embedding process redundant and thus reducing training time, while providing desirable retrieval results. Furthermore, we propose the use of an ingredient attention mechanism, in order to gain insight into which instructions, parts of instructions or single instruction words are of importance for processing a single ingredient within a certain recipe. Attention-based recipe text encoding contributes to solving the issue of high intra-class/low inter-class variability by focusing on preparation steps specific to the meal. The experimental results demonstrate the potential of such a system for recipe retrieval from images.

{"input": "With an increasing number of malicious attacks, the number of people and organizations falling prey to social engineering attacks is proliferating. Despite considerable research in mitigation systems, attackers continually improve their modus operandi by using sophisticated machine learning, natural language processing techniques with an intent to launch successful targeted attacks aimed at deceiving detection mechanisms as well as the victims. We propose a system for advanced email masquerading attacks using Natural Language Generation (NLG) techniques. Using legitimate as well as an influx of varying malicious content, the proposed deep learning system generates \\textit{fake} emails with malicious content, customized depending on the attacker's intent. The system leverages Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for automated text generation.

{"input": "Implicit discourse relation recognition is a crucial component for automatic discourselevel analysis and nature language understanding. Previous studies exploit discriminative models that are built on either powerful manual features or deep discourse representations. In this paper, instead, we explore generative models and propose a variational neural discourse relation recognizer. We refer to this model as VarNDRR. VarNDRR establishes a directed probabilistic model with a latent continuous variable that generates both a discourse and the relation between the two arguments of the discourse. In order to perform efficient inference and learning, we introduce neural discourse relation models to approximate the prior and posterior distributions of the latent variable, and employ these approximated distributions to optimize a reparameterized variational lower bound. This allows VarNDRR to be trained with standard stochastic gradient methods. Experiments on the benchmark data set show that VarNDRR can achieve comparable results against stateof- the-art baselines without using any manual features.\nQuestion: What datasets are used?", "prediction": "How are they evaluated?\n< Explanation: We use the following datasets: (1) the BIBREF10 corpus, which consists of 10000 sentences, each of which is annotated with a discourse relation and a pair of arguments.

As a complementary new resource for these tasks, we present the GitHub Typo Corpus, a large-scale, multilingual dataset of misspellings and grammatical errors along with their corrections harvested from GitHub, a large and popular platform for hosting and sharing git repositories. The dataset, which we have made publicly available, contains more than 350k edits and 65M characters in more than 15 languages, making it the largest dataset of misspellings to date. We also describe our process for filtering true typo edits based on learned classifiers on a small annotated subset, and demonstrate that typo edits can be identified with F1 ~ 0.9 using a very simple classifier with only three features. The detailed analyses of the dataset show that existing spelling correctors merely achieve an F-measure of approx. 0.5, suggesting that the dataset serves as a new, rich source of spelling errors that complement existing datasets.\nQuestion: Which languages are covered in the corpus?", "prediction": "How many edits are there in total?\n< Explanation: The dataset contains 15 languages, with 11 languages having more than 100,000 edits.

{"input": "Speech-based natural language question-answering interfaces to enterprise systems are gaining a lot of attention. General-purpose speech engines can be integrated with NLP systems to provide such interfaces. Usually, general-purpose speech engines are trained on large `general' corpus. However, when such engines are used for specific domains, they may not recognize domain-specific words well, and may produce erroneous output. Further, the accent and the environmental conditions in which the speaker speaks a sentence may induce the speech engine to inaccurately recognize certain words. The subsequent natural language question-answering does not produce the requisite results as the question does not accurately represent what the speaker intended. Thus, the speech engine's output may need to be adapted for a domain before further natural language processing is carried out.

The conventional method is based on the following steps: (1) word embeddings: the word embeddings database contains 100000 word embeddings, each of which is a 300-dimensional vector. The word embeddings are learned by training a neural network on the word embeddings database. (2) feature extraction: the word embeddings are used to extract features from"}

State-of-the-art deep learning-based models require a large number of data to achieve their best performance. Many datasets fulfilling this criterion have been proposed for multiple domains, such as Amazon products, restaurants, or beers. However, works and datasets in the hotel domain are limited: the largest hotel review dataset is below the million samples. Additionally, the hotel domain suffers from a higher data sparsity than traditional recommendation datasets and therefore, traditional collaborative-filtering approaches cannot be applied to such data. In this paper, we propose HotelRec, a very large-scale hotel recommendation dataset, based on TripAdvisor, containing 50 million reviews. To the best of our knowledge, HotelRec is the largest publicly available dataset in the hotel domain (50M versus 0.9M) and additionally, the largest recommendation dataset in a single domain and with textual reviews (50M versus 22M).

{"input": "Opinion summarization is the task of automatically generating summaries for a set of opinions about a specific target (e.g., a movie or a product). Since the number of input documents can be prohibitively large, neural network-based methods sacrifice end-to-end elegance and follow a two-stage approach where an extractive model first pre-selects a subset of salient opinions and an abstractive model creates the summary while conditioning on the extracted subset. However, the extractive stage leads to information loss and inflexible generation capability. In this paper we propose a summarization framework that eliminates the need to pre-select salient content. We view opinion summarization as an instance of multi-source transduction, and make use of all input documents by condensing them into multiple dense vectors which serve as input to an abstractive model. Beyond producing more informative summaries, we demonstrate that our approach allows to take user preferences into account based on a simple zero-shot customization technique.

Since the number of input documents can be prohibitively large, neural network-based methods sacrifice end-to-end elegance and follow a two-stage approach where an extractive model first pre-selects a subset of salient opinions and an abstractive model creates the summary while conditioning on the extracted subset. However, the extractive stage leads to information loss and inflexible generation capability. In this paper we propose a summarization framework that eliminates the need to pre-select salient content. We view opinion summarization as an instance of multi-source transduction, and make use of all input documents by condensing them into multiple dense vectors which serve as input to an abstractive model. Beyond producing more informative summaries, we demonstrate that our approach allows to take user preferences into account based on a simple zero-shot customization technique. Experimental results show that our model improves the state of the art on the Rotten Tomatoes dataset by a wide margin and generates customized summaries effectively.\nQuestion: How large is the dataset used?", "prediction": "What is the size of the dataset?\n< Explanation: The Rotten Tomatoes dataset contains 1000 reviews from 1000 users.

Learning pre-trained vectors used in semantic models further, on given corpus, can give addition spike in performance. Using weighing techniques in between different statistical models too further refines our result. For Statistical models, we have used TF/IDF, TextRAnk, Jaccard/Cosine Similarities.

{"input": "While social media offer great communication opportunities, they also increase the vulnerability of young people to threatening situations online. Recent studies report that cyberbullying constitutes a growing problem among youngsters. Successful prevention depends on the adequate detection of potentially harmful messages and the information overload on the Web requires intelligent systems to identify potential risks automatically. The focus of this paper is on automatic cyberbullying detection in social media text by modelling posts written by bullies, victims, and bystanders of online bullying. We describe the collection and fine-grained annotation of a training corpus for English and Dutch and perform a series of binary classification experiments to determine the feasibility of automatic cyberbullying detection.

{"input": "The Internet and, in particular, Online Social Networks have changed the way that terrorist and extremist groups can influence and radicalise individuals. Recent reports show that the mode of operation of these groups starts by exposing a wide audience to extremist material online, before migrating them to less open online platforms for further radicalization. Thus, identifying radical content online is crucial to limit the reach and spread of the extremist narrative. In this paper, our aim is to identify measures to automatically detect radical content in social media. We identify several signals, including textual, psychological and behavioural, that together allow for the classification of radical messages. Our contribution is three-fold: (1) we analyze propaganda material published by extremist groups and create a contextual text-based model of radical content, (2) we build a model of psychological properties inferred from these material, and (3) we evaluate these models on Twitter to determine the extent to which it is possible to automatically identify online radical tweets. Our results show that radical users do exhibit distinguishable textual, psychological, and behavioural properties. We find that the psychological properties are among the most distinguishing features. Additionally, our results show that textual models using vector embedding features significantly improves the detection over TF-IDF features.

{"input": "We propose a neural network architecture for learning vector representations of hotels. Unlike previous works, which typically only use user click information for learning item embeddings, we propose a framework that combines several sources of data, including user clicks, hotel attributes (e.g., property type, star rating, average user rating), amenity information (e.g., the hotel has free Wi-Fi or free breakfast), and geographic information. During model training, a joint embedding is learned from all of the above information. We show that including structured attributes about hotels enables us to make better predictions in a downstream task than when we rely exclusively on click data. We train our embedding model on more than 40 million user click sessions from a leading online travel platform and learn embeddings for more than one million hotels. Our final learned embeddings integrate distinct sub-embeddings for user clicks, hotel attributes, and geographic information, providing an interpretable representation that can be used flexibly depending on the application. We show empirically that our model generates high-quality representations that boost the performance of a hotel recommendation system in addition to other applications. An important advantage of the proposed neural model is that it addresses the cold-start problem for hotels with insufficient historical click information by incorporating additional hotel attributes which are available for all hotels.\nQuestion: what is the cold-start problem?", "prediction": "How does the proposed model address it?\n< Explanation: The cold-start problem is a common problem in machine learning.

{"input": "The notion of\"in-domain data\"in NLP is often over-simplistic and vague, as textual data varies in many nuanced linguistic aspects such as topic, style or level of formality. In addition, domain labels are many times unavailable, making it challenging to build domain-specific systems. We show that massive pre-trained language models implicitly learn sentence representations that cluster by domains without supervision -- suggesting a simple data-driven definition of domains in textual data. We harness this property and propose domain data selection methods based on such models, which require only a small set of in-domain monolingual data. We evaluate our data selection methods for neural machine translation across five diverse domains, where they outperform an established approach as measured by both BLEU and by precision and recall of sentence selection with respect to an oracle.\nQuestion: How much improvement is there in the BLEU score?", "prediction": "What is the baseline?\n< Explanation: We compare our methods to the baseline of the original approach of BIBREF10, which uses a pre-trained language model to cluster sentences into domains.

{"input": "The goal of our paper is to semantically edit parts of an image matching a given text that describes desired attributes (e.g., texture, colour, and background), while preserving other contents that are irrelevant to the text. To achieve this, we propose a novel generative adversarial network (ManiGAN), which contains two key components: text-image affine combination module (ACM) and detail correction module (DCM). The ACM selects image regions relevant to the given text and then correlates the regions with corresponding semantic words for effective manipulation. Meanwhile, it encodes original image features to help reconstruct text-irrelevant contents. The DCM rectifies mismatched attributes and completes missing contents of the synthetic image. Finally, we suggest a new metric for evaluating image manipulation results, in terms of both the generation of new attributes and the reconstruction of text-irrelevant contents.

{"input": "ELMo embeddings (Peters et. al, 2018) had a huge impact on the NLP community and may recent publications use these embeddings to boost the performance for downstream NLP tasks. However, integration of ELMo embeddings in existent NLP architectures is not straightforward. In contrast to traditional word embeddings, like GloVe or word2vec embeddings, the bi-directional language model of ELMo produces three 1024 dimensional vectors per token in a sentence. Peters et al. proposed to learn a task-specific weighting of these three vectors for downstream tasks. However, this proposed weighting scheme is not feasible for certain tasks, and, as we will show, it does not necessarily yield optimal performance. We evaluate different methods that combine the three vectors from the language model in order to achieve the best possible performance in downstream NLP tasks.

{"input": "ELMo embeddings (Peters et. al, 2018) had a huge impact on the NLP community and may recent publications use these embeddings to boost the performance for downstream NLP tasks. However, integration of ELMo embeddings in existent NLP architectures is not straightforward. In contrast to traditional word embeddings, like GloVe or word2vec embeddings, the bi-directional language model of ELMo produces three 1024 dimensional vectors per token in a sentence. Peters et al. proposed to learn a task-specific weighting of these three vectors for downstream tasks. However, this proposed weighting scheme is not feasible for certain tasks, and, as we will show, it does not necessarily yield optimal performance. We evaluate different methods that combine the three vectors from the language model in order to achieve the best possible performance in downstream NLP tasks.

{"input": "In this paper, we introduce and tackle the Outline Generation (OG) task, which aims to unveil the inherent content structure of a multi-paragraph document by identifying its potential sections and generating the corresponding section headings. Without loss of generality, the OG task can be viewed as a novel structured summarization task. To generate a sound outline, an ideal OG model should be able to capture three levels of coherence, namely the coherence between context paragraphs, that between a section and its heading, and that between context headings. The first one is the foundation for section identification, while the latter two are critical for consistent heading generation. In this work, we formulate the OG task as a hierarchical structured prediction problem, i.e., to first predict a sequence of section boundaries and then a sequence of section headings accordingly. We propose a novel hierarchical structured neural generation model, named HiStGen, for the task. Our model attempts to capture the three-level coherence via the following ways. First, we introduce a Markov paragraph dependency mechanism between context paragraphs for section identification. Second, we employ a section-aware attention mechanism to ensure the semantic coherence between a section and its heading. Finally, we leverage a Markov heading dependency mechanism and a review mechanism between context headings to improve the consistency and eliminate duplication between section headings. Besides, we build a novel WIKIOG dataset, a public collection which consists of over 1.75 million document-outline pairs for research on the OG task.

{"input": "Human verbal communication includes affective messages which are conveyed through use of emotionally colored words. There has been a lot of research in this direction but the problem of integrating state-of-the-art neural language models with affective information remains an area ripe for exploration. In this paper, we propose an extension to an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) language model for generating conversational text, conditioned on affect categories. Our proposed model, Affect-LM enables us to customize the degree of emotional content in generated sentences through an additional design parameter. Perception studies conducted using Amazon Mechanical Turk show that Affect-LM generates naturally looking emotional sentences without sacrificing grammatical correctness. Affect-LM also learns affect-discriminative word representations, and perplexity experiments show that additional affective information in conversational text can improve language model prediction.\nQuestion: How to extract affect attributes from the sentence?", "prediction": "What are the affect categories?\n< Explanation: We use the Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST) BIBREF10 to extract affective attributes from the sentence.

{"input": "Categories such as animal or furniture are acquired at an early age and play an important role in processing, organizing, and communicating world knowledge. Categories exist across cultures: they allow to efficiently represent the complexity of the world, and members of a community strongly agree on their nature, revealing a shared mental representation. Models of category learning and representation, however, are typically tested on data from small-scale experiments involving small sets of concepts with artificially restricted features; and experiments predominantly involve participants of selected cultural and socio-economical groups (very often involving western native speakers of English such as U.S. college students) . This work investigates whether models of categorization generalize (a) to rich and noisy data approximating the environment humans live in; and (b) across languages and cultures. We present a Bayesian cognitive model designed to jointly learn categories and their structured representation from natural language text which allows us to (a) evaluate performance on a large scale, and (b) apply our model to a diverse set of languages. We show that meaningful categories comprising hundreds of concepts and richly structured featural representations emerge across languages. Our work illustrates the potential of recent advances in computational modeling and large scale naturalistic datasets for cognitive science research.\nQuestion: what languages did they evaluate on?", "prediction": "Explanation: We evaluated our model on 10 languages: English, French, German, Spanish, Arabic, Chinese, Japanese, Hindi, Korean, and Arabic.

{"input": "In this paper, we present a method for correcting automatic speech recognition (ASR) errors using a finite state transducer (FST) intent recognition framework. Intent recognition is a powerful technique for dialog flow management in turn-oriented, human-machine dialogs. This technique can also be very useful in the context of human-human dialogs, though it serves a different purpose of key insight extraction from conversations. We argue that currently available intent recognition techniques are not applicable to human-human dialogs due to the complex structure of turn-taking and various disfluencies encountered in spontaneous conversations, exacerbated by speech recognition errors and scarcity of domain-specific labeled data.

{"input": "Princeton WordNet is one of the most important resources for natural language processing, but is only available for English. While it has been translated using the expand approach to many other languages, this is an expensive manual process. Therefore it would be beneficial to have a high-quality automatic translation approach that would support NLP techniques, which rely on WordNet in new languages. The translation of wordnets is fundamentally complex because of the need to translate all senses of a word including low frequency senses, which is very challenging for current machine translation approaches. For this reason we leverage existing translations of WordNet in other languages to identify contextual information for wordnet senses from a large set of generic parallel corpora. We evaluate our approach using 10 translated wordnets for European languages. Our experiment shows a significant improvement over translation without any contextual information. Furthermore, we evaluate how the choice of pivot languages affects performance of multilingual word sense disambiguation.\nQuestion: Which metrics do they use to evaluate results?", "prediction": "What are they?\n<sep><br/ >Answer: We use precision, recall, F1 score, and the number of correct translations.

{"input": "Language change is a complex social phenomenon, revealing pathways of communication and sociocultural influence. But, while language change has long been a topic of study in sociolinguistics, traditional linguistic research methods rely on circumstantial evidence, estimating the direction of change from differences between older and younger speakers. In this paper, we use a data set of several million Twitter users to track language changes in progress. First, we show that language change can be viewed as a form of social influence: we observe complex contagion for phonetic spellings and\"netspeak\"abbreviations (e.g., lol), but not for older dialect markers from spoken language. Next, we test whether specific types of social network connections are more influential than others, using a parametric Hawkes process model. We find that tie strength plays an important role: densely embedded social ties are significantly better conduits of linguistic influence. Geographic locality appears to play a more limited role: we find relatively little evidence to support the hypothesis that individuals are more influenced by geographically local social ties, even in their usage of geographical dialect markers.\nQuestion: What sociolinguistic variables (phonetic spellings) did they analyze?", "prediction": "Explanation: We use a data set of 1.5 million tweets per day from Twitter, which we call the Twitter Corpus.

{"input": "Cross-domain sentiment analysis (CDSA) helps to address the problem of data scarcity in scenarios where labelled data for a domain (known as the target domain) is unavailable or insufficient. However, the decision to choose a domain (known as the source domain) to leverage from is, at best, intuitive. In this paper, we investigate text similarity metrics to facilitate source domain selection for CDSA. We report results on 20 domains (all possible pairs) using 11 similarity metrics. Specifically, we compare CDSA performance with these metrics for different domain-pairs to enable the selection of a suitable source domain, given a target domain. These metrics include two novel metrics for evaluating domain adaptability to help source domain selection of labelled data and utilize word and sentence-based embeddings as metrics for unlabelled data.

{"input": "Traditional sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models and other variations of the attention-mechanism such as hierarchical attention have been applied to the text summarization problem. Though there is a hierarchy in the way humans use language by forming paragraphs from sentences and sentences from words, hierarchical models have usually not worked that much better than their traditional seq2seq counterparts. This effect is mainly because either the hierarchical attention mechanisms are too sparse using hard attention or noisy using soft attention. In this paper, we propose a method based on extracting the highlights of a document; a key concept that is conveyed in a few sentences. In a typical text summarization dataset consisting of documents that are 800 tokens in length (average), capturing long-term dependencies is very important, e.g., the last sentence can be grouped with the first sentence of a document to form a summary. LSTMs (Long Short-Term Memory) proved useful for machine translation. However, they often fail to capture long-term dependencies while modeling long sequences. To address these issues, we have adapted Neural Semantic Encoders (NSE) to text summarization, a class of memory-augmented neural networks by improving its functionalities and proposed a novel hierarchical NSE that outperforms similar previous models significantly. The quality of summarization was improved by augmenting linguistic factors, namely lemma, and Part-of-Speech (PoS) tags, to each word in the dataset for improved vocabulary coverage and generalization.

Ensembling and unknown word replacement add another 2 Bleu which brings the NMT performance on low-resource machine translation close to a strong syntax based machine translation (SBMT) system, exceeding its performance on one language pair. Additionally, using the transfer learning model for re-scoring, we can improve the SBMT system by an average of 1.3 Bleu, improving the state-of-the-art on low-resource machine translation.\nQuestion: How did they constrain training using the parameters?", "prediction": "What is the role of the parameters?\n< Explanation: We use the parameters of the parent model to constrain the child model during training. Specifically, we use the parameters of the parent model to initialize the child model, and then we use the parameters of the child model to constrain the child model during training. This is done by setting the parameters of the child model to zero, and then training the child model to maximize the loss function. We use the parameters of the parent model to initialize the child model, and then we use the parameters of the child model to constrain the child model during training.

{"input": "We study the problem of semantic matching in product search, that is, given a customer query, retrieve all semantically related products from the catalog. Pure lexical matching via an inverted index falls short in this respect due to several factors: a) lack of understanding of hypernyms, synonyms, and antonyms, b) fragility to morphological variants (e.g.\"woman\"vs.\"women\"), and c) sensitivity to spelling errors. To address these issues, we train a deep learning model for semantic matching using customer behavior data. Much of the recent work on large-scale semantic search using deep learning focuses on ranking for web search. In contrast, semantic matching for product search presents several novel challenges, which we elucidate in this paper. We address these challenges by a) developing a new loss function that has an inbuilt threshold to differentiate between random negative examples, impressed but not purchased examples, and positive examples (purchased items), b) using average pooling in conjunction with n-grams to capture short-range linguistic patterns, c) using hashing to handle out of vocabulary tokens, and d) using a model parallel training architecture to scale across 8 GPUs. We present compelling offline results that demonstrate at least 4.7% improvement in Recall@100 and 14.5% improvement in mean average precision (MAP) over baseline state-of-the-art semantic search methods using the same tokenization method.

By augmenting scarce human labelled code-changed text with ample synthetic code-reformatted text and meaning, we achieve significant improvements in sentiment scoring. Our research explores how to understand sentiment in an intrasentential code mixing and switching context where there has been significant word localization.This work presents a 300 VADER lexicon compatible Nigerian Pidgin sentiment tokens and their scores and a 14,000 gold standard Nigerian Pidgin tweets and their sentiments labels.\nQuestion: What full English language based sentiment analysis models are tried?", "prediction": "How do they compare to the Nigerian Pidgin sentiment analysis?\n< Explanation: We use the following full English language based sentiment analysis models: (1) Bag of Words (BoW) model: This model is a simple model that uses a bag of words to represent the sentiment of a tweet.

{"input": "Ensembling is a well-known technique in neural machine translation (NMT) to improve system performance. Instead of a single neural net, multiple neural nets with the same topology are trained separately, and the decoder generates predictions by averaging over the individual models. Ensembling often improves the quality of the generated translations drastically. However, it is not suitable for production systems because it is cumbersome and slow. This work aims to reduce the runtime to be on par with a single system without compromising the translation quality. First, we show that the ensemble can be unfolded into a single large neural network which imitates the output of the ensemble system. We show that unfolding can already improve the runtime in practice since more work can be done on the GPU.

Further to the efforts of reducing exposure to misinformation on social media, purveyors of fake news have begun to masquerade as satire sites to avoid being demoted. In this work, we address the challenge of automatically classifying fake news versus satire. Previous work have studied whether fake news and satire can be distinguished based on language differences. Contrary to fake news, satire stories are usually humorous and carry some political or social message. We hypothesize that these nuances could be identified using semantic and linguistic cues. Consequently, we train a machine learning method using semantic representation, with a state-of-the-art contextual language model, and with linguistic features based on textual coherence metrics. Empirical evaluation attests to the merits of our approach compared to the language-based baseline and sheds light on the nuances between fake news and satire.

{"input": "Recently there has been a growing concern about machine bias, where trained statistical models grow to reflect controversial societal asymmetries, such as gender or racial bias. A significant number of AI tools have recently been suggested to be harmfully biased towards some minority, with reports of racist criminal behavior predictors, Iphone X failing to differentiate between two Asian people and Google photos' mistakenly classifying black people as gorillas. Although a systematic study of such biases can be difficult, we believe that automated translation tools can be exploited through gender neutral languages to yield a window into the phenomenon of gender bias in AI. In this paper, we start with a comprehensive list of job positions from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) and used it to build sentences in constructions like\"He/She is an Engineer\"in 12 different gender neutral languages such as Hungarian, Chinese, Yoruba, and several others. We translate these sentences into English using the Google Translate API, and collect statistics about the frequency of female, male and gender-neutral pronouns in the translated output. We show that GT exhibits a strong tendency towards male defaults, in particular for fields linked to unbalanced gender distribution such as STEM jobs. We ran these statistics against BLS' data for the frequency of female participation in each job position, showing that GT fails to reproduce a real-world distribution of female workers. We provide experimental evidence that even if one does not expect in principle a 50:50 pronominal gender distribution, GT yields male defaults much more frequently than what would be expected from demographic data alone. We are hopeful that this work will ignite a debate about the need to augment current statistical translation tools with debiasing techniques which can already be found in the scientific literature.\nQuestion: Which of the 12 languages showed the strongest tendency towards male defaults?", "prediction": "What is the gender distribution of the translated sentences?\n< Explanation: We show that the gender distribution of the translated sentences is significantly different from the expected distribution of female workers in the BLS data.

However, most existing methods focus solely on text, ignoring other types of unstructured data such as images, video and audio which comprise an increasing portion of the information on the web. To address this shortcoming, we propose the task of multimodal attribute extraction. Given a collection of unstructured and semi-structured contextual information about an entity (such as a textual description, or visual depictions) the task is to extract the entity's underlying attributes. In this paper, we provide a dataset containing mixed-media data for over 2 million product items along with 7 million attribute-value pairs describing the items which can be used to train attribute extractors in a weakly supervised manner.

{"input": "Rule-based techniques and tools to extract entities and relational entities from documents allow users to specify desired entities using natural language questions, finite state automata, regular expressions, structured query language statements, or proprietary scripts. These techniques and tools require expertise in linguistics and programming and lack support of Arabic morphological analysis which is key to process Arabic text. In this work, we present MERF; a morphology-based entity and relational entity extraction framework for Arabic text. MERF provides a user-friendly interface where the user, with basic knowledge of linguistic features and regular expressions, defines tag types and interactively associates them with regular expressions defined over Boolean formulae. Boolean formulae range over matches of Arabic morphological features, and synonymity features. Users define user defined relations with tuples of subexpression matches and can associate code actions with subexpressions. MERF computes feature matches, regular expression matches, and constructs entities and relational entities from user defined relations. We evaluated our work with several case studies and compared with existing application-specific techniques. The results show that MERF requires shorter development time and effort compared to existing techniques and produces reasonably accurate results within a reasonable overhead in run time.\nQuestion: What existing techniques do the authors compare against?", "prediction": "What are the results?\n<blockquote>Table 1: Comparison of existing techniques with MERF.

{"input": "The main approach of traditional information retrieval (IR) is to examine how many words from a query appear in a document. A drawback of this approach, however, is that it may fail to detect relevant documents where no or only few words from a query are found. The semantic analysis methods such as LSA (latent semantic analysis) and LDA (latent Dirichlet allocation) have been proposed to address the issue, but their performance is not superior compared to common IR approaches.

However, many applications in artificial intelligence involve more than one modality. It is therefore of broad interest to study the more difficult and complex problem of modeling and learning across multiple modalities. In this paper, a technical review of the models and learning methods for multimodal intelligence is provided. The main focus is the combination of vision and natural language, which has become an important area in both computer vision and natural language processing research communities. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of recent work on multimodal deep learning from three angles --- learning multimodal representations, the fusion of multimodal signals at various levels, and multimodal applications. On multimodal representation learning, we review the key concept of embedding, which unifies the multimodal signals into the same vector space and thus enables cross-modality signal processing. We also review the properties of the many types of embedding constructed and learned for general downstream tasks. On multimodal fusion, this review focuses on special architectures for the integration of the representation of unimodal signals for a particular task. On applications, selected areas of a broad interest in current literature are covered, including image-to-text caption generation, text-to-image generation, and visual question answering. We believe this review can facilitate future studies in the emerging field of multimodal intelligence for the community.\nQuestion: What are special architectures this review focuses on that are related to multimodal fusion?", "prediction": "Please provide references.\n<sep>1.

However, the effect of pretrained language representation for few-shot learning on text classification tasks is still not well understood. In this study, we design a few-shot learning model with pretrained language representations and report the empirical results. We show that our approach is not only simple but also produces state-of-the-art performance on a well-studied sentiment classification dataset.

{"input": "Relying entirely on an attention mechanism, the Transformer introduced by Vaswani et al. (2017) achieves state-of-the-art results for machine translation. In contrast to recurrent and convolutional neural networks, it does not explicitly model relative or absolute position information in its structure. Instead, it requires adding representations of absolute positions to its inputs. In this work we present an alternative approach, extending the self-attention mechanism to efficiently consider representations of the relative positions, or distances between sequence elements. On the WMT 2014 English-to-German and English-to-French translation tasks, this approach yields improvements of 1.3 BLEU and 0.3 BLEU over absolute position representations, respectively.

{"input": "Concept-to-text generation typically employs a pipeline architecture, which often leads to suboptimal texts. Content selection, for example, may greedily select the most important facts, which may require, however, too many words to express, and this may be undesirable when space is limited or expensive. Selecting other facts, possibly only slightly less important, may allow the lexicalization stage to use much fewer words, or to report more facts in the same space. Decisions made during content selection and lexicalization may also lead to more or fewer sentence aggregation opportunities, affecting the length and readability of the resulting texts. Building upon on a publicly available state of the art natural language generator for Semantic Web ontologies, this article presents an Integer Linear Programming model that, unlike pipeline architectures, jointly considers choices available in content selection, lexicalization, and sentence aggregation to avoid greedy local decisions and produce more compact texts, i.e., texts that report more facts per word. Compact texts are desirable, for example, when generating advertisements to be included in Web search results, or when summarizing structured information in limited space. An extended version of the proposed model also considers a limited form of referring expression generation and avoids redundant sentences. An approximation of the two models can be used when longer texts need to be generated. Experiments with three ontologies confirm that the proposed models lead to more compact texts, compared to pipeline systems, with no deterioration or with improvements in the perceived quality of the generated texts.\nQuestion: Which ontologies did they use?", "prediction": "What are the lengths of the texts?\n<blockquote>\n<font size=\"2\">The three ontologies used in this work are: </font>\n<font size=\"3\">1) The Ontology of the Semantic Web (OSW) (OSW) </font>\n<font size=\"3\">2) The Ontology of the Semantic Web (OSW) (OSW) </font>\n<font size=\"3\">3) The Ontology of the Semantic Web (OSW) (OSW) </font>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<font size=\"2\">The three ontologies used in this work"}

{"input": "Semantic composition functions have been playing a pivotal role in neural representation learning of text sequences. In spite of their success, most existing models suffer from the underfitting problem: they use the same shared compositional function on all the positions in the sequence, thereby lacking expressive power due to incapacity to capture the richness of compositionality. Besides, the composition functions of different tasks are independent and learned from scratch. In this paper, we propose a new sharing scheme of composition function across multiple tasks. Specifically, we use a shared meta-network to capture the meta-knowledge of semantic composition and generate the parameters of the task-specific semantic composition models.

Due to its harmful effect on minority groups as well as on large communities, there is a pressing need for hate speech detection and filtering.

Thus, there is a need for predictive machine learning models that not only detect hate speech but also help users understand when texts cross the line and become unacceptable.

{"input": "Training data for NLP tasks often exhibits gender bias in that fewer sentences refer to women than to men. In Neural Machine Translation (NMT) gender bias has been shown to reduce translation quality, particularly when the target language has grammatical gender. The recent WinoMT challenge set allows us to measure this effect directly (Stanovsky et al, 2019). Ideally we would reduce system bias by simply debiasing all data prior to training, but achieving this effectively is itself a challenge. Rather than attempt to create a `balanced' dataset, we use transfer learning on a small set of trusted, gender-balanced examples. This approach gives strong and consistent improvements in gender debiasing with much less computational cost than training from scratch. A known pitfall of transfer learning on new domains is `catastrophic forgetting', which we address both in adaptation and in inference. During adaptation we show that Elastic Weight Consolidation allows a performance trade-off between general translation quality and bias reduction. During inference we propose a lattice-rescoring scheme which outperforms all systems evaluated in Stanovsky et al (2019) on WinoMT with no degradation of general test set BLEU, and we show this scheme can be applied to remove gender bias in the output of `black box` online commercial MT systems. We demonstrate our approach translating from English into three languages with varied linguistic properties and data availability.\nQuestion: How is the set of trusted, gender-balanced examples selected?", "prediction": "What is the size of the set?\n< Explanation: We use the WinoMT challenge set (Stanovsky et al, 2019) to train our models.

First we analyze the principles for verb patterns: generality and specificity. Then we propose a nonparametric model based on description length. Experimental results prove the high effectiveness of verb patterns. We further apply verb patterns to context-aware conceptualization, to show that verb patterns are helpful in semantic-related tasks.\nQuestion: what evaluation metrics are used?", "prediction": "Explanation: We use the following metrics to evaluate the performance of the proposed model:\n\n1) BLEU: BLEU is a well-known metric for evaluating the performance of language models.

{"input": "The rise in popularity and ubiquity of Twitter has made sentiment analysis of tweets an important and well-covered area of research. However, the 140 character limit imposed on tweets makes it hard to use standard linguistic methods for sentiment classification. On the other hand, what tweets lack in structure they make up with sheer volume and rich metadata. This metadata includes geolocation, temporal and author information. We hypothesize that sentiment is dependent on all these contextual factors. Different locations, times and authors have different emotional valences. In this paper, we explored this hypothesis by utilizing distant supervision to collect millions of labelled tweets from different locations, times and authors. We used this data to analyse the variation of tweet sentiments across different authors, times and locations. Once we explored and understood the relationship between these variables and sentiment, we used a Bayesian approach to combine these variables with more standard linguistic features such as n-grams to create a Twitter sentiment classifier.

{"input": "An important concern in training multilingual neural machine translation (NMT) is to translate between language pairs unseen during training, i.e zero-shot translation. Improving this ability kills two birds with one stone by providing an alternative to pivot translation which also allows us to better understand how the model captures information between languages. In this work, we carried out an investigation on this capability of the multilingual NMT models. First, we intentionally create an encoder architecture which is independent with respect to the source language. Such experiments shed light on the ability of NMT encoders to learn multilingual representations, in general. Based on such proof of concept, we were able to design regularization methods into the standard Transformer model, so that the whole architecture becomes more robust in zero-shot conditions. We investigated the behaviour of such models on the standard IWSLT 2017 multilingual dataset. We achieved an average improvement of 2.23 BLEU points across 12 language pairs compared to the zero-shot performance of a state-of-the-art multilingual system. Additionally, we carry out further experiments in which the effect is confirmed even for language pairs with multiple intermediate pivots.\nQuestion: What architecture is used in the encoder?", "prediction": "How does it differ from the standard Transformer architecture?\n<sep><br>The encoder architecture is a simple encoder which is independent of the source language.

{"input": "Producing natural and accurate responses like human beings is the ultimate goal of intelligent dialogue agents. So far, most of the past works concentrate on selecting or generating one pertinent and fluent response according to current query and its context. These models work on a one-to-one environment, making one response to one utterance each round. However, in real human-human conversations, human often sequentially sends several short messages for readability instead of a long message in one turn. Thus messages will not end with an explicit ending signal, which is crucial for agents to decide when to reply. So the first step for an intelligent dialogue agent is not replying but deciding if it should reply at the moment. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose a novel Imagine-then-Arbitrate (ITA) neural dialogue model to help the agent decide whether to wait or to make a response directly.

So far, most of the past works concentrate on selecting or generating one pertinent and fluent response according to current query and its context. These models work on a one-to-one environment, making one response to one utterance each round. However, in real human-human conversations, human often sequentially sends several short messages for readability instead of a long message in one turn. Thus messages will not end with an explicit ending signal, which is crucial for agents to decide when to reply. So the first step for an intelligent dialogue agent is not replying but deciding if it should reply at the moment. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose a novel Imagine-then-Arbitrate (ITA) neural dialogue model to help the agent decide whether to wait or to make a response directly. Our method has two imaginator modules and an arbitrator module. The two imaginators will learn the agent's and user's speaking style respectively, generate possible utterances as the input of the arbitrator, combining with dialogue history. And the arbitrator decides whether to wait or to make a response to the user directly. To verify the performance and effectiveness of our method, we prepared two dialogue datasets and compared our approach with several popular models. Experimental results show that our model performs well on addressing ending prediction issue and outperforms baseline models.\nQuestion: What is the source of their datasets?", "prediction": "How are they constructed?\n< Explanation: We collected two datasets from the online forums.

We achieved first place in the hierarchical subtask B and second place on the root node, flat classification subtask A. In subtask A, we applied a simple multi-feature TF-IDF extraction method using different n-gram range and stopword removal, on each feature extraction module. The classifier on top was a standard linear SVM. For the hierarchical classification, we used a local approach, which was more light-weighted but was similar to the one used in subtask A.

{"input": "The creation of large-scale open domain reading comprehension data sets in recent years has enabled the development of end-to-end neural comprehension models with promising results. To use these models for domains with limited training data, one of the most effective approach is to first pretrain them on large out-of-domain source data and then fine-tune them with the limited target data. The caveat of this is that after fine-tuning the comprehension models tend to perform poorly in the source domain, a phenomenon known as catastrophic forgetting. In this paper, we explore methods that overcome catastrophic forgetting during fine-tuning without assuming access to data from the source domain. We introduce new auxiliary penalty terms and observe the best performance when a combination of auxiliary penalty terms is used to regularise the fine-tuning process for adapting comprehension models.

{"input": "Recently, recommender systems have been able to emit substantially improved recommendations by leveraging user-provided reviews. Existing methods typically merge all reviews of a given user or item into a long document, and then process user and item documents in the same manner. In practice, however, these two sets of reviews are notably different: users' reviews reflect a variety of items that they have bought and are hence very heterogeneous in their topics, while an item's reviews pertain only to that single item and are thus topically homogeneous. In this work, we develop a novel neural network model that properly accounts for this important difference by means of asymmetric attentive modules. The user module learns to attend to only those signals that are relevant with respect to the target item, whereas the item module learns to extract the most salient contents with regard to properties of the item.

{"input": "Open-domain human-computer conversation has attracted much attention in the field of NLP. Contrary to rule- or template-based domain-specific dialog systems, open-domain conversation usually requires data-driven approaches, which can be roughly divided into two categories: retrieval-based and generation-based systems. Retrieval systems search a user-issued utterance (called a query) in a large database, and return a reply that best matches the query. Generative approaches, typically based on recurrent neural networks (RNNs), can synthesize new replies, but they suffer from the problem of generating short, meaningless utterances. In this paper, we propose a novel ensemble of retrieval-based and generation-based dialog systems in the open domain. In our approach, the retrieved candidate, in addition to the original query, is fed to an RNN-based reply generator, so that the neural model is aware of more information. The generated reply is then fed back as a new candidate for post-reranking. Experimental results show that such ensemble outperforms each single part of it by a large margin.\nQuestion: What datasets are used?", "prediction": "How are they used?\n< Explanation: We use the following datasets: (1) the Open Domain Corpus (ODC) BIBREF1 , which is a collection of 10,000 utterances from 10,000 users, and (2) the Open Domain Corpus with a Fewer Users (ODC-FM) BIBREF2 , which is a collection of 10,000 utterances from 10,000 users, but with a smaller number of users.

{"input": "Humor is an essential human trait. Efforts to understand humor have called out links between humor and the foundations of cognition, as well as the importance of humor in social engagement. As such, it is a promising and important subject of study, with relevance for artificial intelligence and human-computer interaction. Previous computational work on humor has mostly operated at a coarse level of granularity, e.g., predicting whether an entire sentence, paragraph, document, etc., is humorous. As a step toward deep understanding of humor, we seek fine-grained models of attributes that make a given text humorous. Starting from the observation that satirical news headlines tend to resemble serious news headlines, we build and analyze a corpus of satirical headlines paired with nearly identical but serious headlines. The corpus is constructed via Unfun.me, an online game that incentivizes players to make minimal edits to satirical headlines with the goal of making other players believe the results are serious headlines. The edit operations used to successfully remove humor pinpoint the words and concepts that play a key role in making the original, satirical headline funny. Our analysis reveals that the humor tends to reside toward the end of headlines, and primarily in noun phrases, and that most satirical headlines follow a certain logical pattern, which we term false analogy. Overall, this paper deepens our understanding of the syntactic and semantic structure of satirical news headlines and provides insights for building humor-producing systems.\nQuestion: Where can I access the dataset?", "prediction": "Explanation: The dataset is available at https://github.com/alexander-lee/HS-2019-01-01-Satirical-Headlines.

We introduce 40 morphologically complete dictionaries in 10 languages and evaluate three of the state-of-the-art models on the task of translation of less frequent morphological forms. We demonstrate that the performance of state-of-the-art models drops considerably when evaluated on infrequent morphological inflections and then show that adding a simple morphological constraint at training time improves the performance, proving that the bilingual lexicon inducers can benefit from better encoding of morphology.\nQuestion: What is the morphological constraint added?", "prediction": "How is it evaluated?\n< Explanation: We introduce a simple morphological constraint at training time that is evaluated by a simple rule-based method. The constraint is to add a morpheme to the word that is not in the dictionary. We evaluate the performance of the model on the training set and on the test set. We find that the performance of the model drops significantly when evaluated on infrequent morphological inflections. We also find that the performance of the model drops significantly when evaluated on infrequent morphological inflections. We conclude that the performance of the model drops significantly when evaluated on infrequent morphological inflections. We also find that"}
{"input": "Computational context understanding refers to an agent's ability to fuse disparate sources of information for decision-making and is, therefore, generally regarded as a prerequisite for sophisticated machine reasoning capabilities, such as in artificial intelligence (AI). Data-driven and knowledge-driven methods are two classical techniques in the pursuit of such machine sense-making capability. However, while data-driven methods seek to model the statistical regularities of events by making observations in the real-world, they remain difficult to interpret and they lack mechanisms for naturally incorporating external knowledge. Conversely, knowledge-driven methods, combine structured knowledge bases, perform symbolic reasoning based on axiomatic principles, and are more interpretable in their inferential processing; however, they often lack the ability to estimate the statistical salience of an inference. To combat these issues, we propose the use of hybrid AI methodology as a general framework for combining the strengths of both approaches. Specifically, we inherit the concept of neuro-symbolism as a way of using knowledge-bases to guide the learning progress of deep neural networks.

We investigate the scaling relations in citywise Twitter corpora coming from the Metropolitan and Micropolitan Statistical Areas of the United States. We observe a slightly superlinear urban scaling with the city population for the total volume of the tweets and words created in a city. We then find that a certain core vocabulary follows the scaling relationship of that of the bulk text, but most words are sensitive to city size, exhibiting a super- or a sublinear urban scaling. For both regimes we can offer a plausible explanation based on the meaning of the words. We also show that the parameters for Zipf's law and Heaps law differ on Twitter from that of other texts, and that the exponent of Zipf's law changes with city size.\nQuestion: What explanation do the authors offer for the super or sublinear urban scaling?", "prediction": "What is the relationship between the parameters for Zipf's law and Heaps law?\n< Explanation: We propose that the super- or sublinear urban scaling is due to the fact that the number of words in a city is proportional to the square of the city population.

As earlier studies suggest, human-annotated datasets usually contain biases, which are often exploited by models to achieve high accuracy without truly understanding the text. In order to comprehensively evaluate the logical reasoning ability of models on ReClor, we propose to identify biased data points and separate them into EASY set while the rest as HARD set. Empirical results show that the state-of-the-art models have an outstanding ability to capture biases contained in the dataset with high accuracy on EASY set.

{"input": "Recent powerful pre-trained language models have achieved remarkable performance on most of the popular datasets for reading comprehension. It is time to introduce more challenging datasets to push the development of this field towards more comprehensive reasoning of text. In this paper, we introduce a new Reading Comprehension dataset requiring logical reasoning (ReClor) extracted from standardized graduate admission examinations. As earlier studies suggest, human-annotated datasets usually contain biases, which are often exploited by models to achieve high accuracy without truly understanding the text. In order to comprehensively evaluate the logical reasoning ability of models on ReClor, we propose to identify biased data points and separate them into EASY set while the rest as HARD set. Empirical results show that the state-of-the-art models have an outstanding ability to capture biases contained in the dataset with high accuracy on EASY set. However, they struggle on HARD set with poor performance near that of random guess, indicating more research is needed to essentially enhance the logical reasoning ability of current models.\nQuestion: How are biases identified in the dataset?", "prediction": "What are the biases?\n< Explanation: We first identify the bias points in the dataset by comparing the predicted probabilities of the model with the ground truth. We then separate the dataset into EASY and HARD sets. The EASY set is used to evaluate the model's performance on the ground truth, and the HARD set is used to evaluate the model's performance on the predicted probabilities. The model is trained on the EASY set and tested on the HARD set. The model's performance on the HARD set is then used to evaluate the model's performance on the EASY set. The model is then retrained on the EASY set and tested"}

{"input": "Parkinson's disease patients develop different speech impairments that affect their communication capabilities. The automatic assessment of the speech of the patients allows the development of computer aided tools to support the diagnosis and the evaluation of the disease severity.

The proposed approach considers convolutional neural networks trained with time frequency representations and a transfer learning strategy among the three languages. The transfer learning scheme aims to improve the accuracy of the models when the weights of the neural network are initialized with utterances from a different language than the used for the test set. The results suggest that the proposed strategy improves the accuracy of the models in up to 8\\% when the base model used to initialize the weights of the classifier is robust enough.

Different from previous knowledge distillation methods, which only use the output from the last layer of the teacher network for distillation, our student model patiently learns from multiple intermediate layers of the teacher model for incremental knowledge extraction, following two strategies: ($i$) PKD-Last: learning from the last $k$ layers; and ($ii$) PKD-Skip: learning from every $k$ layers. These two patient distillation schemes enable the exploitation of rich information in the teacher's hidden layers, and encourage the student model to patiently learn from and imitate the teacher through a multi-layer distillation process. Empirically, this translates into improved results on multiple NLP tasks with significant gain in training efficiency, without sacrificing model accuracy.\nQuestion: What of the two strategies works best?", "prediction": "How do they compare?\n< Explanation: We compare the two strategies in the following experiments. The first strategy, PKD-Last, is to learn from the last $k$ layers of the teacher model. The second strategy, PKD-Skip, is to learn from every $k$ layers of the teacher model. The results are shown in Table 1. We observe that the second strategy outperforms the first one, especially for the tasks with a large number of layers.

The model consists of two phases that are executed iteratively, 1) an insertion phase and 2) a deletion phase. The insertion phase parameterizes a distribution of insertions on the current output hypothesis, while the deletion phase parameterizes a distribution of deletions over the current output hypothesis. The training method is a principled and simple algorithm, where the deletion model obtains its signal directly on-policy from the insertion model output.

{"input": "The Transformer is widely used in natural language processing tasks. To train a Transformer however, one usually needs a carefully designed learning rate warm-up stage, which is shown to be crucial to the final performance but will slow down the optimization and bring more hyper-parameter tunings. In this paper, we first study theoretically why the learning rate warm-up stage is essential and show that the location of layer normalization matters. Specifically, we prove with mean field theory that at initialization, for the original-designed Post-LN Transformer, which places the layer normalization between the residual blocks, the expected gradients of the parameters near the output layer are large. Therefore, using a large learning rate on those gradients makes the training unstable. The warm-up stage is practically helpful for avoiding this problem. On the other hand, our theory also shows that if the layer normalization is put inside the residual blocks (recently proposed as Pre-LN Transformer), the gradients are well-behaved at initialization. This motivates us to remove the warm-up stage for the training of Pre-LN Transformers. We show in our experiments that Pre-LN Transformers without the warm-up stage can reach comparable results with baselines while requiring significantly less training time and hyper-parameter tuning on a wide range of applications.\nQuestion: How much is training speeded up?", "prediction": "What is the difference between the two models?\n< Explanation: We compare the performance of the two models on the BIBREF10 dataset.

We find that 41.62% of faces in ILSVRC appear as female, 1.71% appear as individuals above the age of 60, and males aged 15 to 29 account for the largest subgroup with 27.11%. We note that the presented model-driven framework is not fair for all intersectional groups, so annotation are subject to bias. We present this work as the starting point for future development of unbiased annotation models and for the study of downstream effects of imbalances in the demographics of ImageNet.

{"input": "This paper presents a novel neural model - Dynamic Fusion Network (DFN), for machine reading comprehension (MRC). DFNs differ from most state-of-the-art models in their use of a dynamic multi-strategy attention process, in which passages, questions and answer candidates are jointly fused into attention vectors, along with a dynamic multi-step reasoning module for generating answers. With the use of reinforcement learning, for each input sample that consists of a question, a passage and a list of candidate answers, an instance of DFN with a sample-specific network architecture can be dynamically constructed by determining what attention strategy to apply and how many reasoning steps to take. Experiments show that DFNs achieve the best result reported on RACE, a challenging MRC dataset that contains real human reading questions in a wide variety of types. A detailed empirical analysis also demonstrates that DFNs can produce attention vectors that summarize information from questions, passages and answer candidates more effectively than other popular MRC models.\nQuestion: How much improvement is given on RACE by their introduced approach?", "prediction": "What is the best result reported on RACE?\n< Explanation: The results of the experiments are shown in Table 1.

Disabling the pruning step drops the accuracy of the model from 43.3% to 36.3%.

In this paper, we investigate another venue for social media monitoring, namely issue ownership and agenda setting, which are concepts from political science that have been used to explain voter choice and electoral outcomes. We argue that issue alignment and agenda setting can be seen as a kind of semantic source similarity of the kind\"how similar is source A to issue owner P, when talking about issue X\", and as such can be measured using word/document embedding techniques.

After that, we designed a model which still keeps an RNN as the encoder, while using a non-autoregressive convolutional decoder. We further combine a suite of effective designs to significantly improve model efficiency while also achieving better performance. Our model is trained on two different large unlabelled corpora, and in both cases the transferability is evaluated on a set of downstream NLP tasks. We empirically show that our model is simple and fast while producing rich sentence representations that excel in downstream tasks.\nQuestion: How long are the two unlabelled corpora?", "prediction": "What are the sizes?\n< Explanation: The two corpora are 100,000 and 100,000 words respectively. The first one is a large corpus of English news articles, while the second one is a large corpus of English news articles with a focus on science and technology. The corpus sizes are 100,000 words and 100,000 words respectively. The corpus sizes are 100,000 words and 100,000 words respectively. The corpus sizes are 100,000 words"}
{"input": "Including diverse voices in political decision-making strengthens our democratic institutions.

{"input": "We analyze the performance of different sentiment classification models on syntactically complex inputs like A-but-B sentences. The first contribution of this analysis addresses reproducible research: to meaningfully compare different models, their accuracies must be averaged over far more random seeds than what has traditionally been reported. With proper averaging in place, we notice that the distillation model described in arXiv:1603.06318v4 [cs.LG], which incorporates explicit logic rules for sentiment classification, is ineffective. In contrast, using contextualized ELMo embeddings (arXiv:1802.05365v2 [cs.CL]) instead of logic rules yields significantly better performance. Additionally, we provide analysis and visualizations that demonstrate ELMo's ability to implicitly learn logic rules. Finally, a crowdsourced analysis reveals how ELMo outperforms baseline models even on sentences with ambiguous sentiment labels.\nQuestion: What logic rules can be learned using ELMo?", "prediction": "What are the limitations of using ELMo?\n< Explanation: We first introduce the concept of logic rules, which are a form of explicit rule-based logic that can be used to classify sentences into categories.

We show that ELMo can learn explicit rules for sentiment classification, and that it can also learn implicit rules that are not explicitly stated in the training data.

The hallmark of the system is its ability to handle overlapped speech, which has been an unsolved problem in realistic settings for over a decade.

In addition, we describe an online audio-visual speaker diarization method that leverages face tracking and identification, sound source localization, speaker identification, and, if available, prior speaker information for robustness to various real world challenges. All components are integrated in a meeting transcription framework called SRD, which stands for \"separate, recognize, and diarize\". Experimental results using recordings of natural meetings involving up to 11 attendees are reported. The continuous speech separation improves a word error rate (WER) by 16.1% compared with a highly tuned beamformer. When a complete list of meeting attendees is available, the discrepancy between WER and speaker-attributed WER is only 1.0%, indicating accurate word-to-speaker association.

Overton automates the life cycle of model construction, deployment, and monitoring by providing a set of novel high-level, declarative abstractions. Overton's vision is to shift developers to these higher-level tasks instead of lower-level machine learning tasks. In fact, using Overton, engineers can build deep-learning-based applications without writing any code in frameworks like TensorFlow. For over a year, Overton has been used in production to support multiple applications in both near-real-time applications and back-of-house processing. In that time, Overton-based applications have answered billions of queries in multiple languages and processed trillions of records reducing errors 1.7-2.9 times versus production systems.\nQuestion: How are applications presented in Overton?", "prediction": "What are the challenges they face?\nThey are presented as a set of tasks, each with a set of inputs and outputs.

In this work we focus on the task of extracting plane crash event information from clusters of related news articles whose labels are derived via distant supervision.

We leverage a phrase-based statistical machine translation (PBSMT) model and a pre-trained language model to combine word-level neural machine translation (NMT) and subword-level NMT models without using any parallel data. We propose to solve the morphological richness problem of languages by training byte-pair encoding (BPE) embeddings for German and Czech separately, and they are aligned using MUSE (Conneau et al., 2018). To ensure the fluency and consistency of translations, a rescoring mechanism is proposed that reuses the pre-trained language model to select the translation candidates generated through beam search.

The BLEU score is a measure of the quality of the translation, and it is a weighted average of the individual BLEU scores of the individual words.

{"input": "There is a growing interest in creating tools to assist in clinical note generation using the audio of provider-patient encounters. Motivated by this goal and with the help of providers and medical scribes, we developed an annotation scheme to extract relevant clinical concepts. We used this annotation scheme to label a corpus of about 6k clinical encounters. This was used to train a state-of-the-art tagging model. We report ontologies, labeling results, model performances, and detailed analyses of the results. Our results show that the entities related to medications can be extracted with a relatively high accuracy of 0.90 F-score, followed by symptoms at 0.72 F-score, and conditions at 0.57 F-score. In our task, we not only identify where the symptoms are mentioned but also map them to canonical forms as they appear in the clinical notes. Of the different types of errors, in about 19-38% of the cases, we find that the model output was correct, and about 17-32% of the errors do not impact the clinical note.

{"input": "Social media are becoming an increasingly important source of information about the public mood regarding issues such as elections, Brexit, stock market, etc. In this paper we focus on sentiment classification of Twitter data. Construction of sentiment classifiers is a standard text mining task, but here we address the question of how to properly evaluate them as there is no settled way to do so. Sentiment classes are ordered and unbalanced, and Twitter produces a stream of time-ordered data. The problem we address concerns the procedures used to obtain reliable estimates of performance measures, and whether the temporal ordering of the training and test data matters. We collected a large set of 1.5 million tweets in 13 European languages. We created 138 sentiment models and out-of-sample datasets, which are used as a gold standard for evaluations. The corresponding 138 in-sample datasets are used to empirically compare six different estimation procedures: three variants of cross-validation, and three variants of sequential validation (where test set always follows the training set). We find no significant difference between the best cross-validation and sequential validation. However, we observe that all cross-validation variants tend to overestimate the performance, while the sequential methods tend to underestimate it. Standard cross-validation with random selection of examples is significantly worse than the blocked cross-validation, and should not be used to evaluate classifiers in time-ordered data scenarios.\nQuestion: Which three variants of sequential validation are examined?", "prediction": "What is the performance of the sequential methods?\n<blockquote>3. Sequential validation: We use the sequential validation method described in Section 3.1. We use the same training and test sets, and we use the same number of examples in the training and test sets. We use the same number of examples in the training and test sets, and we use the same number of examples in the training and test sets.

{"input": "Social media are becoming an increasingly important source of information about the public mood regarding issues such as elections, Brexit, stock market, etc. In this paper we focus on sentiment classification of Twitter data. Construction of sentiment classifiers is a standard text mining task, but here we address the question of how to properly evaluate them as there is no settled way to do so. Sentiment classes are ordered and unbalanced, and Twitter produces a stream of time-ordered data. The problem we address concerns the procedures used to obtain reliable estimates of performance measures, and whether the temporal ordering of the training and test data matters. We collected a large set of 1.5 million tweets in 13 European languages. We created 138 sentiment models and out-of-sample datasets, which are used as a gold standard for evaluations. The corresponding 138 in-sample datasets are used to empirically compare six different estimation procedures: three variants of cross-validation, and three variants of sequential validation (where test set always follows the training set).

Sequential cross-validation: We use the same training and test sets, but we select the test set in a sequential manner, i.e., we select the test set from the training set, then the training set from the test set, and so on. This is the most straightforward way to evaluate classifiers in time-ordered data. We use this method to evaluate the performance of the classifiers in the following experiments.\n\n2.
