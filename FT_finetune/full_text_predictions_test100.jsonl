{"id": "1911.10742", "prompt": "Considerable progress has been made building end-to-end dialog systems for collaborative tasks in which users cooperate with the system to achieve a common goal. Examples of collaborative tasks include making restaurant reservations and retrieving bus time-table information. Since users typically have clear and explicit intentions in collaborative tasks, existing systems commonly classify user utterances into pre-defined intents. In contrast, non-collaborative tasks are those where the users and the system do not strive to achieve the same goal. Examples of such tasks include deceiving attackers, persuading users to donate to a cause BIBREF1, and negotiating a product price BIBREF2, BIBREF3. In these tasks, users often perform complex actions that are beyond a simple set of pre-defined intents. In order to reach a common state, the user and the system need to build rapport and trust which naturally involves off-task content. Previous work did not model off-task content BIBREF2, which may have led to less optimal results. For example, in the persuasion task BIBREF1, users would ask the system \u201cHow do you feel about war?\" An example of an on-task system response that the system could have made is \u201cDo you want to make a donation?\", which sticks to the task but neglects users' question. However, a better response to such an off-task question is \u201cWar is destructive and pitiless, but you can donate to help child victims of war.\" This response is better, as it has been found that users are more likely to end the conversation if the system neglects their questions BIBREF4. Therefore, we need to design a system that handles both on-task and off-task information appropriately and in a way that leads back to the system's goal.\nTo tackle the issue of incoherent system responses to off-task content, previous studies have built hybrid systems to interleave off-task and on-task content. BIBREF4 used a rule-based dialog manager for on-task content and a neural model for off-task content, and trained a reinforcement learning model to select between these two models based on the dialog context. However, such a method is difficult to train and struggles to generalize beyond the movie promotion task they considered. To tackle these problems, we propose a hierarchical intent annotation scheme that separates on-task and off-task information in order to provide detailed supervision. For on-task information, we directly use task-related intents for representation. Off-task information, on the other hand, is too general to categorize into specific intents, so we choose dialog acts that convey syntax information. These acts, such as \u201copen question\" are general to all tasks.\nPrevious studies use template-based methods to maintain sentence coherence. However, rigid templates lead to limited diversity, causing the user losing engagement. On the other hand, language generation models can generate diverse responses but are bad at being coherent. We propose Multiple Intents and Semantic Slots Annotation Neural Network (MISSA) to combine the advantages of both template and generation models and takes advantage from the hierarchical annotation at the same time. MISSA follows the TransferTransfo framework BIBREF0 with three modifications: (i) We first concurrently predict user's, system's intents and semantic slots; (ii) We then perform conditional generation to improve generated response's coherence. Specifically, we generate responses conditioned on the above intermediate representation (intents and slots); (iii) Finally, we generate multiple responses with the nucleus sampling strategy BIBREF5 and then apply a response filter, which contains a set of pre-defined constraints to select coherent responses. The constraints in the filter can be defined according to specific task requirements or general conversational rules.\nTo enrich publicly available non-collaborative task datasets, we collect a new dataset AntiScam, where users defend themselves against attackers trying to collect personal information. As non-collaborative tasks are still relatively new to the study of dialog systems, there are insufficiently many meaningful datasets for evaluation and we hope this provides a valuable example. We evaluate MISSA on the newly collected AntiScam dataset and an existing PersuasionForGood dataset. Both automatic and human evaluations suggest that MISSA outperforms multiple competitive baselines.\nIn summary, our contributions include: (i) We design a hierarchical intent annotation scheme and a semantic slot annotation scheme to annotate the non-collaborative dialog dataset, we also propose a carefully-designed AntiScam dataset to facilitate the research of non-collaborative dialog systems. (ii) We propose a model that can be applied to all non-collaborative tasks, outperforming other baselines on two different non-collaborative tasks. (iii) We develop an anti-scam dialog system to occupy attacker's attention and elicit their private information for social good. Furthermore, we also build a persuasion dialog system to persuade people to donate to charities. We release the code and data.\nThe interest in non-collaborative tasks has been increasing and there have already been several related datasets. For instance, BIBREF1 wang2019persuasion collected conversations where one participant persuades another to donate to a charity. BIBREF2 he2018decoupling collected negotiation dialogs where buyers and sellers bargain for items for sale on Craigslist. There are many other non-collaborative tasks, such as the turn-taking game BIBREF6, the multi-party game BIBREF7 and item splitting negotiation BIBREF8. Similar to the AntiScam dataset proposed in this paper, these datasets contain off-task content and can be used to train non-collaborative dialog systems. However, since they are not specifically collected and designed for non-collaborative tasks, it might be difficult to disentangle the on-task and off-task contents and measure the performance. Therefore, we propose the AntiScam dataset, which is designed to interleave the on-task and off-task contents in the conversation, and can serve as a benchmark dataset for similar non-collaborative tasks.\nTo better understand user utterances and separate on-task and off-task content within a conversation, previous work has designed hierarchical annotation schemes for specific domains. BIBREF9 hardy2002multi followed the DAMSL schemeBIBREF10 and annotated a multilingual human-computer dialog corpus with a hierarchical dialog act annotation scheme. BIBREF11 gupta2018semantic used a hierarchical annotation scheme for semantic parsing. Inspired by these studies, our idea is to annotate the intent and semantic slot separately in non-collaborative tasks. We propose a hierarchical intent annotation scheme that can be adopted by all non-collaborative tasks. With this annotation scheme, MISSA is able to quickly build an end-to-end trainable dialog system for any non-collaborative task.\nTraditional task-oriented dialog systems BIBREF12 are usually composed of multiple independent modules, for example, natural language understanding, dialog state tracking BIBREF13, BIBREF14, dialog policy manager BIBREF15, and natural language generation BIBREF16. Conversational intent is adopted to capture the meaning of task content in these dialog systems BIBREF2, BIBREF17. In comparison to this work, we use a hierarchical intent scheme that includes off-task and on-task intents to capture utterance meaning. We also train the model in a multi-task fashion to predict decoupled intents and semantic slots. The major defect of a separately trained pipeline is the laborious dialog state design and annotation. In order to mitigate this problem, recent work has explored replacing independent modules with end-to-end neural networks BIBREF18, BIBREF19, BIBREF20. Our model also follows this end-to-end fashion.\nOver the last few years, we have witnessed a huge growth in non-task-oriented dialog systems BIBREF21, BIBREF22. Social chatbots such as Gunrock BIBREF23 were able to maintain a conversation for around ten minutes in an open domain. Recent improvements build on top of the transformer and pre-trained language models BIBREF24, BIBREF25, BIBREF26, obtained state-of-the-art results on the Persona-Chat dataset BIBREF0. Pre-trained language models are proposed to build task-oriented dialog systems to drive the progress on leveraging large amounts of available unannotated data. BIBREF27. Similarly, our approach is also built on top of the TransferTransfo framework BIBREF0. BIBREF27 budzianowski2019hello focused on collaborative tasks BIBREF28. We target non-collaborative tasks instead.\nAnother line of work interleaves on-task and off-task content by building a hybrid dialog system that combines a task-oriented model and a non-task-oriented model BIBREF4, BIBREF29. In these studies, task-oriented systems and non-task-oriented systems are designed separately and both systems generate candidate responses. A selector is then designed to choose an appropriate output from the candidate responses BIBREF4 and a connector to combine two response candidates BIBREF30, BIBREF31. Compared with these works, MISSA is end-to-end trainable and thus easier to train and update.\nTo decouple syntactic and semantic information in utterances and provide detailed supervision, we design a hierarchical intent annotation scheme for non-collaborative tasks. We first separate on-task and off-task intents. As on-task intents are key actions that can vary among different tasks, we need to specifically define on-task intents for each task. On the other hand, since off-task content is too general to design task-specific intents, we choose common dialog acts as the categories. The advantage of this hierarchical annotation scheme is apparent when starting a new non-collaborative task: we only need to focus on designing the on-task categories and semantic slots which are the same as traditional task-oriented dialog systems. Consequently, we don't have to worry about the off-task annotation design since the off-task category is universal.\nIn the intent annotation scheme shown in Table TABREF2, we list the designed intent annotation scheme for the newly collected AntiScam dataset and the PersuasionForGood dataset. We first define on-task intents for the datasets, which are key actions in the task. Since our AntiScam focuses on understanding and reacting towards elicitations, we define elicitation, providing_information and refusal as on-task intents. In the PersuasionForGood dataset, we define nine on-task intents in Table TABREF2 based on the original PersuasionForGood dialog act annotation scheme. All these intents are related to donation actions, which are salient on-task intents in the persuasion task. The off-task intents are the same for both tasks, including six general intents and six additional social intents. General intents are more closely related to the syntactic meaning of the sentence (open_question, yes_no_question, positive_answer, negative_answer, responsive_statement, and nonresponsive_statement) while social intents are common social actions (greeting, closing, apology, thanking,respond_to_thank, and hold).\nFor specific tasks, we also design a semantic slot annotation scheme for annotating sentences based on their semantic content. We identify 13 main semantic slots in the anti-scam task, for example, credit card numbers. We present a detailed semantic slot annotation in Table TABREF3. Following BIBREF1, we segment each conversation turn into single sentences and then annotate each sentence rather than turns.\nWe test our approach on two non-collaborative task datasets: the AntiScam dataset and the PersuasionForGood dataset BIBREF1. Both datasets are collected from the Amazon Mechanical Turk platform in the form of typing conversations and off-task dialog is interleaved in the dialog.\nTo enrich available non-collaborative task datasets, we created a corpus of human-human anti-scam dialogs in order to learn human elicitation strategies. We chose a popular Amazon customer service scam scenario to collect dialogs between users and attackers who aim to collect users information. We posted a role-playing task on the Amazon Mechanical Turk platform and collected a typing conversation dataset named AntiScam. We collected 220 human-human dialogs. The average conversation length is 12.45 turns and the average utterance length is 11.13 words. Only 172 out of 220 users successfully identified their partner as an attacker, suggesting that the attackers are well trained and not too easily identifiable. We recruited two expert annotators who have linguistic training to annotate 3,044 sentences in 100 dialogs, achieving a 0.874 averaged weighted kappa value.\nThe PersuasionForGood dataset BIBREF1 was collected from typing conversations on Amazon Mechanical Turk platform. Two workers were randomly paired, one was assigned the role of persuader, the other was persuadee. The goal of the persuader was to persuade the persuadee to donate a portion of task earning to a specific charity. The dataset consists of 1,017 dialogs, where 300 dialogs are annotated with dialog acts. The average conversation length is 10.43, the vocabulary size is 8,141. Since the original PersuasionForGood dataset is annotated with dialog acts, we select the on-task dialog acts as on-task intents shown in Table TABREF2, and categorize the other dialog acts into our pre-defined off-task intents.\nThe TransferTransfo framework was proposed to build open domain dialog systems. BIBREF0 wolf2019transfertransfo fine-tuned the generative pre-training model (GPT) BIBREF32 with the PERSONA-CHAT dataset BIBREF33 in a multi-task fashion, where the language model objective is combined with a next-utterance classification task. The language model's objective is to maximize the following likelihood for a given sequence of tokens, $X = \\lbrace x_1,\\dots ,x_n\\rbrace $:\nThe authors also trained a classifier to distinguish the correct next-utterance appended to the input human utterances from a set of randomly selected utterance distractors. In addition, they introduced dialog state embeddings to indicate speaker role in the model. The model significantly outperformed previous baselines over both automatic evaluations and human evaluations in social conversations. Since the TransferTransfo framework performs well in open domain, we adapt it for non-collaborative settings. We keep all the embeddings in the framework and train the language model and next-utterance classification task in a multi-task fashion following TransferTransfo.\nWe make two major changes: (1) To address the problem that TransferTransfo is originally designed for an open domain without explicit intents and regulations, we add two intent classifiers and two semantic slot classifiers to classify the intents and semantic slots for both human utterances and system responses as an effort to incorporate the proposed hierarchical intent and semantic slot annotation for non-collaborative tasks. (2) In dialog systems, multiple generated responses can be coherent under the current context. Generating diverse responses has proven to be an enduring challenge. To increase response diversity, we sample multiple generated responses and choose an appropriate one according to a set of pre-defined rules.\nWe train MISSA in a multi-task fashion. In addition to the language model task and the next-utterance prediction task, we also use separate classifiers to predict the intents and semantic slots of both human utterances and system responses. The intent classifier and semantic slot classifier for human utterances capture the semantic and syntactic meaning of human utterances, providing information to select the appropriate response among response candidates while the classifiers for the system intents and semantic slots are designed to help select an appropriate next-sentence. We describe response filtering in the corresponding subsection. Classifiers are designed as the following equation:\nwhere $L^i_{t}$ is the intent or semantic label of $i$-th sentence at turn $t$. $h^l_{t-1}$ is the hidden states at the end of last sentence in turn $t-1$, $h^i_{t}$ is the last hidden states at the end of $i$-th sentence in turn $t$. $W_{2h}$ are weights learned during training.\nMISSA is able to classify multiple intents and multiple semantic slots in a single utterance with these classifiers. Figure FIGREF6 shows how it works on the AntiScam dataset. Specifically, we set a special token $<$sep$>$ at the end of each sentence in an utterance (an utterance can consist of multiple sentences). Next, we pass the token's position information to the transformer architecture and obtain the representation of the position (represented as colored position at last layer in Figure FIGREF6). After that, we concatenate the embeddings at these position with the hidden states of last sentence. We pass these concatenated representations to the intent classifier and the slot classifier to obtain an intent and a semantic slot for each sentence in the utterance. As shown in Figure FIGREF6, the loss function ${\\mathcal {L}}$ for the model combines all the task losses:\nwhere ${\\mathcal {L}_{LM}}$ is the language model loss, ${\\mathcal {L}_{I_h}}$, ${\\mathcal {L}_{S_h}}$, ${\\mathcal {L}_{I_s}}$, and ${\\mathcal {L}_{S_s}}$ are losses of intent and slots classifiers, ${\\mathcal {L}_{nup}}$ is next-utterance classification loss. $\\lambda _{LM}$, $\\lambda _{I_h}$, $\\lambda _{S_h}$, $\\lambda _{I_s}$, $\\lambda _{S_s}$, and $\\lambda _{nup}$ are the hyper-parameters that control the relative importance of every loss.\nMISSA can generate multiple sentences in a single system turn. Therefore, we perform system generation conditioned on predicted system intents. More specifically, during the training phase, in addition to inserting a special $<$sep$>$ token at the end of each sentence, we also insert the intent of the system response as special tokens at the head of each sentence in the system response. For example, in Figure FIGREF6, we insert a $<$pos_ans$>$ token at the head of $S_t^1$, which is the system response in green. We then use a cross entropy loss function to calculate the loss between the predicted token and the ground truth intent token. During the testing phase, the model first generates a special intent token, then after being conditioned on this intent token, the model keeps generating a sentence until it generates a $<$sep$>$ token. After that, the model continues to generate another intent token and another sentence until it generates an $<$eos$>$ token.\nSince we only perform conditional generation, a type of soft constraint on the predicted intent of system response, the system can still generate samples that violate simple conversation regulations, such as eliciting information that has already been provided. These corner cases may lead to fatal results in high-risk tasks, for example, health care and education. To improve the robustness of MISSA and improve its ability to generalize to more tasks, we add a response filtering module after the generation. With the nucleus sampling strategy BIBREF5, MISSA is able to generate multiple diverse candidate responses with different intents and semantic slots. We then adopt a task-specific response filtering policy to choose the best candidate response as the final output. In our anti-scam scenario, we set up a few simple rules to filter out some unreasonable candidates, for instance, eliciting the repeated information. The filtering module is easily adaptable to different domains or specific requirements, which makes our dialog system more controllable.\nWe evaluate MISSA on two non-collaborative task datasets. AntiScam aims to build a dialog system that occupies the attacker's attention and elicits the attacker's information while PersuasionForGood BIBREF1 aims to build a dialog system that persuades people to donate to a charity. We use $80\\%$ data for training, $10\\%$ data for validation, and $10\\%$ data for testing. More training details are presented in Appendix.\nWe compare MISSA mainly with two baseline models:\nTransferTransfo The vanilla TransferTransfo framework is compared with MISSA to show the impact and necessity of adding the intent and slot classifiers. We follow the original TransferTransfo design BIBREF0 and train with undelexicalized data.\nHybrid Following BIBREF4 yu2017learning, we also build a hybrid dialog system by combining vanilla TransferTransfo and MISSA. Specifically, we first determine if the human utterances are on-task or off-task with human intent classifier. If the classifier decides that the utterance is on-task, we choose the response from MISSA; otherwise, we choose the response from vanilla TransferTransfo baseline.\nIn addition, we perform ablation studies on MISSA to show the effects of different components.\nMISSA-sel denotes MISSA without response filtering.\nMISSA-con denotes MISSA leaving out the intent token at the start of the response generation.\nPerplexity Since the canonical measure of a good language model is perplexity, which indicates the error rate of the expected word. We choose perplexity to evaluate the model performance.\nResponse-Intent Prediction (RIP) $\\&$ Response-Slot Prediction (RSP) Different from open-domain dialog systems, we care about the intents of the system response in non-collaborative tasks as we hope to know if the system response satisfies user intents. For example, in the anti-scam task, if the attacker elicits information from the system, we need to know if the system refuses or agrees to provide the information. Therefore we care about intent prediction for the generated system response. Since our baselines are more suited for social chat as they cannot produce system intents, we use the system intent and slot classifiers trained in our model to predict their responses' intents and slots. The intent predictor achieves a $84\\%$ accuracy and the semantic slot predictor achieves $77\\%$ on the AntiScam dataset. Then we compare the predicted values with human-annotated ground truth in the dataset to compute the response-intent prediction (RIP) and response-slot prediction (RSP).\nExtended Response-Intent Prediction (ERIP) $\\&$ Extended Response-Slot Prediction (ERSP) With Response-Intent Prediction, we verify the predicted intents to evaluate the coherence of the dialog. However, the real mapping between human-intent and system-intent is much more complicated as there might be multiple acceptable system-intents for the same human-intent. Therefore, we also design a metric to evaluate if the predicted system-intent is in the set of acceptable intents. Specifically, we estimate the transition probability $p(I_i|I_j)$ by counting the frequency of all the bi-gram human-intent and system-intent pairs in the training data. During the test stage, if the predicted intent matches the ground truth, we set the score as 1, otherwise we set the score as $p(I_{predict}|I_i)$ where $I_i$ is the intent of the input human utterance. We then report the average value of those scores over turns as the final extended response-intent prediction result.\nAutomatic metrics only validate the system\u2019s performance on a single dimension at a time. The ultimate holistic evaluation should be conducted by having the trained system interact with human users. Therefore we also conduct human evaluations for the dialog system built on AntiScam. We test our models and baselines with 15 college-student volunteers. Each of them is asked to pretend to be an attacker and interact with all the models for at least three times to avoid randomness. We in total collect 225 number of dialogs. Each time, volunteers are required to use similar sentences and strategies to interact with all five models and score each model based on the metrics listed below at the end of the current round. Each model receives a total of 45 human ratings, and the average score is reported as the final human-evaluation score. In total, we design five different metrics to assess the models' conversational ability whilst interacting with humans. The results are shown in Table TABREF19.\nFluency Fluency is used to explore different models' language generation quality.\nCoherence Different from single sentence's fluency, coherence focuses more on the logical consistency between sentences in each turn.\nEngagement In the anti-scam scenario, one of our missions is to keep engaging with the attackers to waste their time. So we directly ask volunteers (attackers) to what extend they would like to continue chatting with the system.\nDialog length (Length) Engagement is a subjective metric. Anti-scam system's goal is to engage user in the conversation longer in order to limit their harm to other potential victims. So we count the dialog length as another metric to evaluate system performance.\nTask Success Score (TaskSuc) The other goal of the anti-scam system is to elicit attacker's personal information. We count the average type of information (name, address and phone number) that the system obtained from attackers as the task success score.\nTable TABREF19 presents the main experiment results on AntiScam dataset, for both automatic evaluation metrics and human evaluation metrics. The experiment results on PersuasionForGood are shown in Table TABREF23. We observe that MISSA outperforms two baseline models (TransferTransfo and hybrid model) on almost all the metrics on both datasets. For further analysis, examples of real dialogs from the human evaluation are presented in Table TABREF21.\nCompared to the first TransferTransfo baseline, MISSA outperforms the TransferTransfo baseline on the on-task contents. From Table TABREF19, we observe that MISSA maintains longer conversations (14.9 turns) compared with TransferTransfo (8.5 turns), which means MISSA is better at maintaining the attacker's engagement. MISSA also has a higher task success score (1.294) than TransferTransfo (1.025), which indicates that it elicits information more strategically. In the top two dialogs (A and B) that are shown in Table TABREF21, both attackers were eliciting a credit card number in their first turns. TransferTransfo directly gave away the information, while MISSA replied with a semantically-related question \u201cwhy would you need my credit card number?\" Furthermore, in the next turn, TransferTransfo ignored the context and asked an irrelevant question \u201cwhat is your name?\u201d while MISSA was able to generate the response \u201cwhy can't you use my address?\u201d, which is consistent to the context. We suspect the improved performance of MISSA comes from our proposed annotation scheme: the semantic slot information enables MISSA to keep track of the current entities, and the intent information helps MISSA to maintain coherency and prolong conversations.\nCompared to the hybrid model baseline, MISSA performs better on off-task content. As shown in the bottom two dialogs in Table TABREF21, attackers in both dialogs introduced their names in their first utterances. MISSA recognized attacker's name, while the hybrid model did not. We suspect it is because the hybrid model does not have the built-in semantic slot predictor. In the second turn, both attackers were explaining the reason of requesting the billing address previously. With semantic slot information, MISSA can easily understand the attacker; but the hybrid model misunderstands that the attacker was talking about the order number, possibly because the token \u201corder\u201d appeared in the attacker's utterance. We suspect that the hybrid model's bad performance on the off-task content leads to its low coherence rating (2.76) and short dialog length (8.2).\nTo explore the influence of the intent-based conditional response generation method and the designed response filter, we perform an ablation study. The results are shown in Table TABREF19. We find that MISSA has higher fluency score and coherence score than MISSA-con (4.18 vs 3.78 for fluency, and 3.75 vs 3.68 for coherence), which suggests that conditioning on the system intent to generate responses improves the quality of the generated sentences. Compared with MISSA-sel, MISSA achieves better performance on all the metrics. For example, the engagement score for MISSA is 3.69 while MISSA-sel only has 2.87. This is because the response filter removed all the incoherent responses, which makes the attacker more willing to keep chatting. The ablation study shows both the conditional language generation mechanism and the response filter are essential to MISSA's good performance.\nWe also apply our method to the PersuasionForGood dataset. As shown in Table TABREF23, MISSA and its variants outperform the TransferTransfo and the hybrid models on all evaluation metrics. Such good performance indicates MISSA can be easily applied to a different non-collaborative task and achieve good performance. Particularly, MISSA achieves the lowest perplexity, which confirms that using conditional response generation leads to high quality responses. Compared with the result on AntiScam dataset, MISSA-con performs the best in terms of RIP and ERIP. We suspect the underlying reason is that there are more possible responses with the same intent in PersuasionForGood than in AntiScam. This also suggests that we should adjust the model structure according to the nature of the dataset.\nWe propose a general dialog system pipeline to build non-collaborative dialog systems, including a hierarchical annotation scheme and an end-to-end neural response generation model called MISSA. With the hierarchical annotation scheme, we can distinguish on-task and off-task intents. MISSA takes both on and off-task intents as supervision in its training and thus can deal with diverse user utterances in non-collaborative settings. Moreover, to validate MISSA's performance, we create a non-collaborate dialog dataset that focuses on deterring phone scammers. MISSA outperforms all baseline methods in terms of fluency, coherency, and user engagement on both the newly proposed anti-scam task and an existing persuasion task. However, MISSA still produces responses that are not consistent with their distant conversation history as GPT can only track a limited history span. In future work, we plan to address this issue by developing methods that can effectively track longer dialog context.\nThis work was supported by DARPA ASED Program HR001117S0050.

The views and conclusions contained herein are those of the authors and should not be interpreted as necessarily representing the official policies, either expressed or implied, of DARPA or the U.S. Government.\nWe randomly pair two workers: one is assigned the role of the attacker to elicit user information, and the other one is assigned the role of an everyday user who aims to protect her/his information and potentially elicit the attacker's information. We give both workers specific personal data. Instructions are shown in Table TABREF24. The \u201cattacker\u201d additionally receives training on how to elicit information from people. Workers cannot see their partners' instructions.\nThere are two tasks for the users: firstly, users are required to chat with their partners and determine if they are attackers or not, reporting their decisions at the end of the task. If users think their partners are attackers, they are instructed to prolong the conversation and elicit information from their partners. We give a bonus to users if they detect the attackers and elicit real information from the attackers, including the attacker's name, address and phone number. Since one worker can only participate once in the task, they do not know their partners are always attackers.\nWe provide real user information including the user's name and the task background (user purchased a product on Amazon) . Attackers are well-trained to pretend to be an Amazon customer service agent. To simulate a real-world scam, we tell attackers some details about the user, such as the user's name to stop them from being too easily identified. We give a bonus to attackers if they elicit correct information from users, including the user's address, credit card number, CVS and expiration date. Each worker can only participate once to prevent workers from knowing their partner's information and goals in advance. We collected 220 human-human dialogs. The average conversation length is 12.45 turns and the average utterance length is 11.13 words. Only 172 out of 220 users successfully identified their partner as an attacker, suggesting that the attackers are well trained and not too easily identifiable.\nWe recruited two expert annotators who have linguistic training to annotate 3,044 sentences in 100 dialogs, achieving a 0.874 averaged weighted kappa value. Table TABREF2 shows that there is a vast amount of off-task content in the dataset, which confirms the necessity of a hierarchical on-task/off-task annotation scheme. We observe that sentences from the attacker and user have different intent distributions. Compared to attackers, users produce more refusal (74 vs 19), because users are more likely to refuse to provide requested information if they have detected the attacker. Moreover, users also ask more open_questions (173 vs 54) and yes_no_questions (165 vs 117) for off-task content because they are instructed to prolong the conversation after detecting the attacker. Furthermore, attackers and users both have a massive amount of social content (292 in total and 252 in total), suggesting that it is important to have social intent sentences to maintain the conversation.\nMISSA is based on the generative pre-trained transformer BIBREF32. We use an Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 6.25e-5 and $L2$ weight decay of $0.01$, we set the coefficient of language modeling loss to be 2, the coefficient of intent and slot classifiers to be 1, and the coefficient of next-utterance classifier to be 1. We first pre-train the model on the PERSONA-CHAT dataset. When fine-tuning on the AntiScam and the PersuasionForGood datasets, we use $80\\%$ data for training, $10\\%$ data for validation, and $10\\%$ data for testing. Since the original PersuasionForGood dataset is annotated with intents, we separate the original on-task and off-task intents, which are shown in Table TABREF2. To deal with the words out of the vocabulary, we conduct delexicalization to replace slot values with corresponding slot tokens during the training phase, and replace the slot tokens with pre-defined information during testing.\nAn example of human-human chat on AntiScam dataset is shown in Table TABREF25.", "question": "How big is the ANTISCAM dataset?", "expected_output": "3,044 sentences in 100 dialogs.

Examples of collaborative tasks include making restaurant reservations and retrieving bus time-table information. Since users typically have clear and explicit intentions in collaborative tasks, existing systems commonly classify user utterances into pre-defined intents.

Examples of such tasks include deceiving attackers, persuading users to donate to a cause BIBREF1, and negotiating a product price BIBREF2, BIBREF3. In these tasks, users often perform complex actions that are beyond a simple set of pre-defined intents. In order to reach a common state, the user and the system need to build rapport and trust which naturally involves off-task content. Previous work did not model off-task content BIBREF2, which may have led to less optimal results. For example, in the persuasion task BIBREF1, users would ask the system \u201cHow do you feel about war?\" An example of an on-task system response that the system could have made is \u201cDo you want to make a donation?\", which sticks to the task but neglects users' question. However, a better response to such an off-task question is \u201cWar is destructive and pitiless, but you can donate to help child victims of war.\" This response is better, as it has been found that users are more likely to end the conversation if the system neglects their questions BIBREF4. Therefore, we need to design a system that handles both on-task and off-task information appropriately and in a way that leads back to the system's goal.\nTo tackle the issue of incoherent system responses to off-task content, previous studies have built hybrid systems to interleave off-task and on-task content. BIBREF4 used a rule-based dialog manager for on-task content and a neural model for off-task content, and trained a reinforcement learning model to select between these two models based on the dialog context. However, such a method is difficult to train and struggles to generalize beyond the movie promotion task they considered. To tackle these problems, we propose a hierarchical intent annotation scheme that separates on-task and off-task information in order to provide detailed supervision. For on-task information, we directly use task-related intents for representation. Off-task information, on the other hand, is too general to categorize into specific intents, so we choose dialog acts that convey syntax information. These acts, such as \u201copen question\" are general to all tasks.\nPrevious studies use template-based methods to maintain sentence coherence. However, rigid templates lead to limited diversity, causing the user losing engagement. On the other hand, language generation models can generate diverse responses but are bad at being coherent. We propose Multiple Intents and Semantic Slots Annotation Neural Network (MISSA) to combine the advantages of both template and generation models and takes advantage from the hierarchical annotation at the same time. MISSA follows the TransferTransfo framework BIBREF0 with three modifications: (i) We first concurrently predict user's, system's intents and semantic slots; (ii) We then perform conditional generation to improve generated response's coherence. Specifically, we generate responses conditioned on the above intermediate representation (intents and slots); (iii) Finally, we generate multiple responses with the nucleus sampling strategy BIBREF5 and then apply a response filter, which contains a set of pre-defined constraints to select coherent responses. The constraints in the filter can be defined according to specific task requirements or general conversational rules.\nTo enrich publicly available non-collaborative task datasets, we collect a new dataset AntiScam, where users defend themselves against attackers trying to collect personal information. As non-collaborative tasks are still relatively new to the study of dialog systems, there are insufficiently many meaningful datasets for evaluation and we hope this provides a valuable example. We evaluate MISSA on the newly collected AntiScam dataset and an existing PersuasionForGood dataset. Both automatic and human evaluations suggest that MISSA outperforms multiple competitive baselines.\nIn summary, our contributions include: (i) We design a hierarchical intent annotation scheme and a semantic slot annotation scheme to annotate the non-collaborative dialog dataset, we also propose a carefully-designed AntiScam dataset to facilitate the research of non-collaborative dialog systems. (ii) We propose a model that can be applied to all non-collaborative tasks, outperforming other baselines on two different non-collaborative tasks. (iii) We develop an anti-scam dialog system to occupy attacker's attention and elicit their private information for social good. Furthermore, we also build a persuasion dialog system to persuade people to donate to charities. We release the code and data.\nThe interest in non-collaborative tasks has been increasing and there have already been several related datasets. For instance, BIBREF1 wang2019persuasion collected conversations where one participant persuades another to donate to a charity. BIBREF2 he2018decoupling collected negotiation dialogs where buyers and sellers bargain for items for sale on Craigslist. There are many other non-collaborative tasks, such as the turn-taking game BIBREF6, the multi-party game BIBREF7 and item splitting negotiation BIBREF8. Similar to the AntiScam dataset proposed in this paper, these datasets contain off-task content and can be used to train non-collaborative dialog systems. However, since they are not specifically collected and designed for non-collaborative tasks, it might be difficult to disentangle the on-task and off-task contents and measure the performance. Therefore, we propose the AntiScam dataset, which is designed to interleave the on-task and off-task contents in the conversation, and can serve as a benchmark dataset for similar non-collaborative tasks.\nTo better understand user utterances and separate on-task and off-task content within a conversation, previous work has designed hierarchical annotation schemes for specific domains. BIBREF9 hardy2002multi followed the DAMSL schemeBIBREF10 and annotated a multilingual human-computer dialog corpus with a hierarchical dialog act annotation scheme. BIBREF11 gupta2018semantic used a hierarchical annotation scheme for semantic parsing. Inspired by these studies, our idea is to annotate the intent and semantic slot separately in non-collaborative tasks. We propose a hierarchical intent annotation scheme that can be adopted by all non-collaborative tasks. With this annotation scheme, MISSA is able to quickly build an end-to-end trainable dialog system for any non-collaborative task.\nTraditional task-oriented dialog systems BIBREF12 are usually composed of multiple independent modules, for example, natural language understanding, dialog state tracking BIBREF13, BIBREF14, dialog policy manager BIBREF15, and natural language generation BIBREF16. Conversational intent is adopted to capture the meaning of task content in these dialog systems BIBREF2, BIBREF17. In comparison to this work, we use a hierarchical intent scheme that includes off-task and on-task intents to capture utterance meaning. We also train the model in a multi-task fashion to predict decoupled intents and semantic slots. The major defect of a separately trained pipeline is the laborious dialog state design and annotation. In order to mitigate this problem, recent work has explored replacing independent modules with end-to-end neural networks BIBREF18, BIBREF19, BIBREF20. Our model also follows this end-to-end fashion.\nOver the last few years, we have witnessed a huge growth in non-task-oriented dialog systems BIBREF21, BIBREF22. Social chatbots such as Gunrock BIBREF23 were able to maintain a conversation for around ten minutes in an open domain. Recent improvements build on top of the transformer and pre-trained language models BIBREF24, BIBREF25, BIBREF26, obtained state-of-the-art results on the Persona-Chat dataset BIBREF0. Pre-trained language models are proposed to build task-oriented dialog systems to drive the progress on leveraging large amounts of available unannotated data. BIBREF27. Similarly, our approach is also built on top of the TransferTransfo framework BIBREF0. BIBREF27 budzianowski2019hello focused on collaborative tasks BIBREF28. We target non-collaborative tasks instead.\nAnother line of work interleaves on-task and off-task content by building a hybrid dialog system that combines a task-oriented model and a non-task-oriented model BIBREF4, BIBREF29. In these studies, task-oriented systems and non-task-oriented systems are designed separately and both systems generate candidate responses. A selector is then designed to choose an appropriate output from the candidate responses BIBREF4 and a connector to combine two response candidates BIBREF30, BIBREF31. Compared with these works, MISSA is end-to-end trainable and thus easier to train and update.\nTo decouple syntactic and semantic information in utterances and provide detailed supervision, we design a hierarchical intent annotation scheme for non-collaborative tasks. We first separate on-task and off-task intents. As on-task intents are key actions that can vary among different tasks, we need to specifically define on-task intents for each task. On the other hand, since off-task content is too general to design task-specific intents, we choose common dialog acts as the categories. The advantage of this hierarchical annotation scheme is apparent when starting a new non-collaborative task: we only need to focus on designing the on-task categories and semantic slots which are the same as traditional task-oriented dialog systems. Consequently, we don't have to worry about the off-task annotation design since the off-task category is universal.\nIn the intent annotation scheme shown in Table TABREF2, we list the designed intent annotation scheme for the newly collected AntiScam dataset and the PersuasionForGood dataset. We first define on-task intents for the datasets, which are key actions in the task. Since our AntiScam focuses on understanding and reacting towards elicitations, we define elicitation, providing_information and refusal as on-task intents. In the PersuasionForGood dataset, we define nine on-task intents in Table TABREF2 based on the original PersuasionForGood dialog act annotation scheme. All these intents are related to donation actions, which are salient on-task intents in the persuasion task. The off-task intents are the same for both tasks, including six general intents and six additional social intents. General intents are more closely related to the syntactic meaning of the sentence (open_question, yes_no_question, positive_answer, negative_answer, responsive_statement, and nonresponsive_statement) while social intents are common social actions (greeting, closing, apology, thanking,respond_to_thank, and hold).\nFor specific tasks, we also design a semantic slot annotation scheme for annotating sentences based on their semantic content. We identify 13 main semantic slots in the anti-scam task, for example, credit card numbers. We present a detailed semantic slot annotation in Table TABREF3. Following BIBREF1, we segment each conversation turn into single sentences and then annotate each sentence rather than turns.\nWe test our approach on two non-collaborative task datasets: the AntiScam dataset and the PersuasionForGood dataset BIBREF1. Both datasets are collected from the Amazon Mechanical Turk platform in the form of typing conversations and off-task dialog is interleaved in the dialog.\nTo enrich available non-collaborative task datasets, we created a corpus of human-human anti-scam dialogs in order to learn human elicitation strategies. We chose a popular Amazon customer service scam scenario to collect dialogs between users and attackers who aim to collect users information. We posted a role-playing task on the Amazon Mechanical Turk platform and collected a typing conversation dataset named AntiScam. We collected 220 human-human dialogs. The average conversation length is 12.45 turns and the average utterance length is 11.13 words. Only 172 out of 220 users successfully identified their partner as an attacker, suggesting that the attackers are well trained and not too easily identifiable. We recruited two expert annotators who have linguistic training to annotate 3,044 sentences in 100 dialogs, achieving a 0.874 averaged weighted kappa value.\nThe PersuasionForGood dataset BIBREF1 was collected from typing conversations on Amazon Mechanical Turk platform. Two workers were randomly paired, one was assigned the role of persuader, the other was persuadee. The goal of the persuader was to persuade the persuadee to donate a portion of task earning to a specific charity. The dataset consists of 1,017 dialogs, where 300 dialogs are annotated with dialog acts. The average conversation length is 10.43, the vocabulary size is 8,141. Since the original PersuasionForGood dataset is annotated with dialog acts, we select the on-task dialog acts as on-task intents shown in Table TABREF2, and categorize the other dialog acts into our pre-defined off-task intents.\nThe TransferTransfo framework was proposed to build open domain dialog systems. BIBREF0 wolf2019transfertransfo fine-tuned the generative pre-training model (GPT) BIBREF32 with the PERSONA-CHAT dataset BIBREF33 in a multi-task fashion, where the language model objective is combined with a next-utterance classification task. The language model's objective is to maximize the following likelihood for a given sequence of tokens, $X = \\lbrace x_1,\\dots ,x_n\\rbrace $:\nThe authors also trained a classifier to distinguish the correct next-utterance appended to the input human utterances from a set of randomly selected utterance distractors. In addition, they introduced dialog state embeddings to indicate speaker role in the model. The model significantly outperformed previous baselines over both automatic evaluations and human evaluations in social conversations. Since the TransferTransfo framework performs well in open domain, we adapt it for non-collaborative settings. We keep all the embeddings in the framework and train the language model and next-utterance classification task in a multi-task fashion following TransferTransfo.\nWe make two major changes: (1) To address the problem that TransferTransfo is originally designed for an open domain without explicit intents and regulations, we add two intent classifiers and two semantic slot classifiers to classify the intents and semantic slots for both human utterances and system responses as an effort to incorporate the proposed hierarchical intent and semantic slot annotation for non-collaborative tasks. (2) In dialog systems, multiple generated responses can be coherent under the current context. Generating diverse responses has proven to be an enduring challenge. To increase response diversity, we sample multiple generated responses and choose an appropriate one according to a set of pre-defined rules.\nWe train MISSA in a multi-task fashion. In addition to the language model task and the next-utterance prediction task, we also use separate classifiers to predict the intents and semantic slots of both human utterances and system responses. The intent classifier and semantic slot classifier for human utterances capture the semantic and syntactic meaning of human utterances, providing information to select the appropriate response among response candidates while the classifiers for the system intents and semantic slots are designed to help select an appropriate next-sentence. We describe response filtering in the corresponding subsection. Classifiers are designed as the following equation:\nwhere $L^i_{t}$ is the intent or semantic label of $i$-th sentence at turn $t$. $h^l_{t-1}$ is the hidden states at the end of last sentence in turn $t-1$, $h^i_{t}$ is the last hidden states at the end of $i$-th sentence in turn $t$. $W_{2h}$ are weights learned during training.\nMISSA is able to classify multiple intents and multiple semantic slots in a single utterance with these classifiers. Figure FIGREF6 shows how it works on the AntiScam dataset. Specifically, we set a special token $<$sep$>$ at the end of each sentence in an utterance (an utterance can consist of multiple sentences). Next, we pass the token's position information to the transformer architecture and obtain the representation of the position (represented as colored position at last layer in Figure FIGREF6). After that, we concatenate the embeddings at these position with the hidden states of last sentence. We pass these concatenated representations to the intent classifier and the slot classifier to obtain an intent and a semantic slot for each sentence in the utterance. As shown in Figure FIGREF6, the loss function ${\\mathcal {L}}$ for the model combines all the task losses:\nwhere ${\\mathcal {L}_{LM}}$ is the language model loss, ${\\mathcal {L}_{I_h}}$, ${\\mathcal {L}_{S_h}}$, ${\\mathcal {L}_{I_s}}$, and ${\\mathcal {L}_{S_s}}$ are losses of intent and slots classifiers, ${\\mathcal {L}_{nup}}$ is next-utterance classification loss. $\\lambda _{LM}$, $\\lambda _{I_h}$, $\\lambda _{S_h}$, $\\lambda _{I_s}$, $\\lambda _{S_s}$, and $\\lambda _{nup}$ are the hyper-parameters that control the relative importance of every loss.\nMISSA can generate multiple sentences in a single system turn. Therefore, we perform system generation conditioned on predicted system intents. More specifically, during the training phase, in addition to inserting a special $<$sep$>$ token at the end of each sentence, we also insert the intent of the system response as special tokens at the head of each sentence in the system response. For example, in Figure FIGREF6, we insert a $<$pos_ans$>$ token at the head of $S_t^1$, which is the system response in green. We then use a cross entropy loss function to calculate the loss between the predicted token and the ground truth intent token. During the testing phase, the model first generates a special intent token, then after being conditioned on this intent token, the model keeps generating a sentence until it generates a $<$sep$>$ token. After that, the model continues to generate another intent token and another sentence until it generates an $<$eos$>$ token.\nSince we only perform conditional generation, a type of soft constraint on the predicted intent of system response, the system can still generate samples that violate simple conversation regulations, such as eliciting information that has already been provided. These corner cases may lead to fatal results in high-risk tasks, for example, health care and education. To improve the robustness of MISSA and improve its ability to generalize to more tasks, we add a response filtering module after the generation. With the nucleus sampling strategy BIBREF5, MISSA is able to generate multiple diverse candidate responses with different intents and semantic slots. We then adopt a task-specific response filtering policy to choose the best candidate response as the final output. In our anti-scam scenario, we set up a few simple rules to filter out some unreasonable candidates, for instance, eliciting the repeated information. The filtering module is easily adaptable to different domains or specific requirements, which makes our dialog system more controllable.\nWe evaluate MISSA on two non-collaborative task datasets. AntiScam aims to build a dialog system that occupies the attacker's attention and elicits the attacker's information while PersuasionForGood BIBREF1 aims to build a dialog system that persuades people to donate to a charity. We use $80\\%$ data for training, $10\\%$ data for validation, and $10\\%$ data for testing. More training details are presented in Appendix.\nWe compare MISSA mainly with two baseline models:\nTransferTransfo The vanilla TransferTransfo framework is compared with MISSA to show the impact and necessity of adding the intent and slot classifiers. We follow the original TransferTransfo design BIBREF0 and train with undelexicalized data.\nHybrid Following BIBREF4 yu2017learning, we also build a hybrid dialog system by combining vanilla TransferTransfo and MISSA. Specifically, we first determine if the human utterances are on-task or off-task with human intent classifier. If the classifier decides that the utterance is on-task, we choose the response from MISSA; otherwise, we choose the response from vanilla TransferTransfo baseline.\nIn addition, we perform ablation studies on MISSA to show the effects of different components.\nMISSA-sel denotes MISSA without response filtering.\nMISSA-con denotes MISSA leaving out the intent token at the start of the response generation.\nPerplexity Since the canonical measure of a good language model is perplexity, which indicates the error rate of the expected word. We choose perplexity to evaluate the model performance.\nResponse-Intent Prediction (RIP) $\\&$ Response-Slot Prediction (RSP) Different from open-domain dialog systems, we care about the intents of the system response in non-collaborative tasks as we hope to know if the system response satisfies user intents. For example, in the anti-scam task, if the attacker elicits information from the system, we need to know if the system refuses or agrees to provide the information. Therefore we care about intent prediction for the generated system response. Since our baselines are more suited for social chat as they cannot produce system intents, we use the system intent and slot classifiers trained in our model to predict their responses' intents and slots. The intent predictor achieves a $84\\%$ accuracy and the semantic slot predictor achieves $77\\%$ on the AntiScam dataset. Then we compare the predicted values with human-annotated ground truth in the dataset to compute the response-intent prediction (RIP) and response-slot prediction (RSP).\nExtended Response-Intent Prediction (ERIP) $\\&$ Extended Response-Slot Prediction (ERSP) With Response-Intent Prediction, we verify the predicted intents to evaluate the coherence of the dialog. However, the real mapping between human-intent and system-intent is much more complicated as there might be multiple acceptable system-intents for the same human-intent. Therefore, we also design a metric to evaluate if the predicted system-intent is in the set of acceptable intents. Specifically, we estimate the transition probability $p(I_i|I_j)$ by counting the frequency of all the bi-gram human-intent and system-intent pairs in the training data. During the test stage, if the predicted intent matches the ground truth, we set the score as 1, otherwise we set the score as $p(I_{predict}|I_i)$ where $I_i$ is the intent of the input human utterance. We then report the average value of those scores over turns as the final extended response-intent prediction result.\nAutomatic metrics only validate the system\u2019s performance on a single dimension at a time. The ultimate holistic evaluation should be conducted by having the trained system interact with human users. Therefore we also conduct human evaluations for the dialog system built on AntiScam. We test our models and baselines with 15 college-student volunteers. Each of them is asked to pretend to be an attacker and interact with all the models for at least three times to avoid randomness. We in total collect 225 number of dialogs. Each time, volunteers are required to use similar sentences and strategies to interact with all five models and score each model based on the metrics listed below at the end of the current round. Each model receives a total of 45 human ratings, and the average score is reported as the final human-evaluation score. In total, we design five different metrics to assess the models' conversational ability whilst interacting with humans. The results are shown in Table TABREF19.\nFluency Fluency is used to explore different models' language generation quality.\nCoherence Different from single sentence's fluency, coherence focuses more on the logical consistency between sentences in each turn.\nEngagement In the anti-scam scenario, one of our missions is to keep engaging with the attackers to waste their time. So we directly ask volunteers (attackers) to what extend they would like to continue chatting with the system.\nDialog length (Length) Engagement is a subjective metric. Anti-scam system's goal is to engage user in the conversation longer in order to limit their harm to other potential victims. So we count the dialog length as another metric to evaluate system performance.\nTask Success Score (TaskSuc) The other goal of the anti-scam system is to elicit attacker's personal information. We count the average type of information (name, address and phone number) that the system obtained from attackers as the task success score.\nTable TABREF19 presents the main experiment results on AntiScam dataset, for both automatic evaluation metrics and human evaluation metrics. The experiment results on PersuasionForGood are shown in Table TABREF23. We observe that MISSA outperforms two baseline models (TransferTransfo and hybrid model) on almost all the metrics on both datasets. For further analysis, examples of real dialogs from the human evaluation are presented in Table TABREF21.\nCompared to the first TransferTransfo baseline, MISSA outperforms the TransferTransfo baseline on the on-task contents. From Table TABREF19, we observe that MISSA maintains longer conversations (14.9 turns) compared with TransferTransfo (8.5 turns), which means MISSA is better at maintaining the attacker's engagement. MISSA also has a higher task success score (1.294) than TransferTransfo (1.025), which indicates that it elicits information more strategically. In the top two dialogs (A and B) that are shown in Table TABREF21, both attackers were eliciting a credit card number in their first turns. TransferTransfo directly gave away the information, while MISSA replied with a semantically-related question \u201cwhy would you need my credit card number?\" Furthermore, in the next turn, TransferTransfo ignored the context and asked an irrelevant question \u201cwhat is your name?\u201d while MISSA was able to generate the response \u201cwhy can't you use my address?\u201d, which is consistent to the context. We suspect the improved performance of MISSA comes from our proposed annotation scheme: the semantic slot information enables MISSA to keep track of the current entities, and the intent information helps MISSA to maintain coherency and prolong conversations.\nCompared to the hybrid model baseline, MISSA performs better on off-task content. As shown in the bottom two dialogs in Table TABREF21, attackers in both dialogs introduced their names in their first utterances. MISSA recognized attacker's name, while the hybrid model did not. We suspect it is because the hybrid model does not have the built-in semantic slot predictor. In the second turn, both attackers were explaining the reason of requesting the billing address previously. With semantic slot information, MISSA can easily understand the attacker; but the hybrid model misunderstands that the attacker was talking about the order number, possibly because the token \u201corder\u201d appeared in the attacker's utterance. We suspect that the hybrid model's bad performance on the off-task content leads to its low coherence rating (2.76) and short dialog length (8.2).\nTo explore the influence of the intent-based conditional response generation method and the designed response filter, we perform an ablation study. The results are shown in Table TABREF19. We find that MISSA has higher fluency score and coherence score than MISSA-con (4.18 vs 3.78 for fluency, and 3.75 vs 3.68 for coherence), which suggests that conditioning on the system intent to generate responses improves the quality of the generated sentences. Compared with MISSA-sel, MISSA achieves better performance on all the metrics. For example, the engagement score for MISSA is 3.69 while MISSA-sel only has 2.87. This is because the response filter removed all the incoherent responses, which makes the attacker more willing to keep chatting. The ablation study shows both the conditional language generation mechanism and the response filter are essential to MISSA's good performance.\nWe also apply our method to the PersuasionForGood dataset. As shown in Table TABREF23, MISSA and its variants outperform the TransferTransfo and the hybrid models on all evaluation metrics. Such good performance indicates MISSA can be easily applied to a different non-collaborative task and achieve good performance. Particularly, MISSA achieves the lowest perplexity, which confirms that using conditional response generation leads to high quality responses. Compared with the result on AntiScam dataset, MISSA-con performs the best in terms of RIP and ERIP. We suspect the underlying reason is that there are more possible responses with the same intent in PersuasionForGood than in AntiScam. This also suggests that we should adjust the model structure according to the nature of the dataset.\nWe propose a general dialog system pipeline to build non-collaborative dialog systems, including a hierarchical annotation scheme and an end-to-end neural response generation model called MISSA. With the hierarchical annotation scheme, we can distinguish on-task and off-task intents. MISSA takes both on and off-task intents as supervision in its training and thus can deal with diverse user utterances in non-collaborative settings. Moreover, to validate MISSA's performance, we create a non-collaborate dialog dataset that focuses on deterring phone scammers. MISSA outperforms all baseline methods in terms of fluency, coherency, and user engagement on both the newly proposed anti-scam task and an existing persuasion task. However, MISSA still produces responses that are not consistent with their distant conversation history as GPT can only track a limited history span. In future work, we plan to address this issue by developing methods that can effectively track longer dialog context.\nThis work was supported by DARPA ASED Program HR001117S0050.

The views and conclusions contained herein are those of the authors and should not be interpreted as necessarily representing the official policies, either expressed or implied, of DARPA or the U.S. Government.\nWe randomly pair two workers: one is assigned the role of the attacker to elicit user information, and the other one is assigned the role of an everyday user who aims to protect her/his information and potentially elicit the attacker's information. We give both workers specific personal data. Instructions are shown in Table TABREF24. The \u201cattacker\u201d additionally receives training on how to elicit information from people. Workers cannot see their partners' instructions.\nThere are two tasks for the users: firstly, users are required to chat with their partners and determine if they are attackers or not, reporting their decisions at the end of the task. If users think their partners are attackers, they are instructed to prolong the conversation and elicit information from their partners. We give a bonus to users if they detect the attackers and elicit real information from the attackers, including the attacker's name, address and phone number. Since one worker can only participate once in the task, they do not know their partners are always attackers.\nWe provide real user information including the user's name and the task background (user purchased a product on Amazon) . Attackers are well-trained to pretend to be an Amazon customer service agent. To simulate a real-world scam, we tell attackers some details about the user, such as the user's name to stop them from being too easily identified. We give a bonus to attackers if they elicit correct information from users, including the user's address, credit card number, CVS and expiration date. Each worker can only participate once to prevent workers from knowing their partner's information and goals in advance. We collected 220 human-human dialogs. The average conversation length is 12.45 turns and the average utterance length is 11.13 words. Only 172 out of 220 users successfully identified their partner as an attacker, suggesting that the attackers are well trained and not too easily identifiable.\nWe recruited two expert annotators who have linguistic training to annotate 3,044 sentences in 100 dialogs, achieving a 0.874 averaged weighted kappa value. Table TABREF2 shows that there is a vast amount of off-task content in the dataset, which confirms the necessity of a hierarchical on-task/off-task annotation scheme. We observe that sentences from the attacker and user have different intent distributions. Compared to attackers, users produce more refusal (74 vs 19), because users are more likely to refuse to provide requested information if they have detected the attacker. Moreover, users also ask more open_questions (173 vs 54) and yes_no_questions (165 vs 117) for off-task content because they are instructed to prolong the conversation after detecting the attacker. Furthermore, attackers and users both have a massive amount of social content (292 in total and 252 in total), suggesting that it is important to have social intent sentences to maintain the conversation.\nMISSA is based on the generative pre-trained transformer BIBREF32. We use an Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 6.25e-5 and $L2$ weight decay of $0.01$, we set the coefficient of language modeling loss to be 2, the coefficient of intent and slot classifiers to be 1, and the coefficient of next-utterance classifier to be 1. We first pre-train the model on the PERSONA-CHAT dataset. When fine-tuning on the AntiScam and the PersuasionForGood datasets, we use $80\\%$ data for training, $10\\%$ data for validation, and $10\\%$ data for testing. Since the original PersuasionForGood dataset is annotated with intents, we separate the original on-task and off-task intents, which are shown in Table TABREF2. To deal with the words out of the vocabulary, we conduct delexicalization to replace slot values with corresponding slot tokens during the training phase, and replace the slot tokens with pre-defined information during testing.\nAn example of human-human chat on AntiScam dataset is shown in Table TABREF25.", "question": "How is intent annotated?", "expected_output": "using a role-playing task on the Amazon Mechanical Turk platform and collecting typed conversations. Explanation: dataset", "generated_answer": ""}
{"id": "1911.10742", "prompt": "Considerable progress has been made building end-to-end dialog systems for collaborative tasks in which users cooperate with the system to achieve a common goal. Examples of collaborative tasks include making restaurant reservations and retrieving bus time-table information. Since users typically have clear and explicit intentions in collaborative tasks, existing systems commonly classify user utterances into pre-defined intents. In contrast, non-collaborative tasks are those where the users and the system do not strive to achieve the same goal. Examples of such tasks include deceiving attackers, persuading users to donate to a cause BIBREF1, and negotiating a product price BIBREF2, BIBREF3. In these tasks, users often perform complex actions that are beyond a simple set of pre-defined intents. In order to reach a common state, the user and the system need to build rapport and trust which naturally involves off-task content. Previous work did not model off-task content BIBREF2, which may have led to less optimal results. For example, in the persuasion task BIBREF1, users would ask the system \u201cHow do you feel about war?\" An example of an on-task system response that the system could have made is \u201cDo you want to make a donation?\", which sticks to the task but neglects users' question. However, a better response to such an off-task question is \u201cWar is destructive and pitiless, but you can donate to help child victims of war.\" This response is better, as it has been found that users are more likely to end the conversation if the system neglects their questions BIBREF4. Therefore, we need to design a system that handles both on-task and off-task information appropriately and in a way that leads back to the system's goal.\nTo tackle the issue of incoherent system responses to off-task content, previous studies have built hybrid systems to interleave off-task and on-task content. BIBREF4 used a rule-based dialog manager for on-task content and a neural model for off-task content, and trained a reinforcement learning model to select between these two models based on the dialog context. However, such a method is difficult to train and struggles to generalize beyond the movie promotion task they considered. To tackle these problems, we propose a hierarchical intent annotation scheme that separates on-task and off-task information in order to provide detailed supervision. For on-task information, we directly use task-related intents for representation. Off-task information, on the other hand, is too general to categorize into specific intents, so we choose dialog acts that convey syntax information. These acts, such as \u201copen question\" are general to all tasks.\nPrevious studies use template-based methods to maintain sentence coherence. However, rigid templates lead to limited diversity, causing the user losing engagement. On the other hand, language generation models can generate diverse responses but are bad at being coherent. We propose Multiple Intents and Semantic Slots Annotation Neural Network (MISSA) to combine the advantages of both template and generation models and takes advantage from the hierarchical annotation at the same time. MISSA follows the TransferTransfo framework BIBREF0 with three modifications: (i) We first concurrently predict user's, system's intents and semantic slots; (ii) We then perform conditional generation to improve generated response's coherence. Specifically, we generate responses conditioned on the above intermediate representation (intents and slots); (iii) Finally, we generate multiple responses with the nucleus sampling strategy BIBREF5 and then apply a response filter, which contains a set of pre-defined constraints to select coherent responses. The constraints in the filter can be defined according to specific task requirements or general conversational rules.\nTo enrich publicly available non-collaborative task datasets, we collect a new dataset AntiScam, where users defend themselves against attackers trying to collect personal information. As non-collaborative tasks are still relatively new to the study of dialog systems, there are insufficiently many meaningful datasets for evaluation and we hope this provides a valuable example. We evaluate MISSA on the newly collected AntiScam dataset and an existing PersuasionForGood dataset. Both automatic and human evaluations suggest that MISSA outperforms multiple competitive baselines.\nIn summary, our contributions include: (i) We design a hierarchical intent annotation scheme and a semantic slot annotation scheme to annotate the non-collaborative dialog dataset, we also propose a carefully-designed AntiScam dataset to facilitate the research of non-collaborative dialog systems. (ii) We propose a model that can be applied to all non-collaborative tasks, outperforming other baselines on two different non-collaborative tasks. (iii) We develop an anti-scam dialog system to occupy attacker's attention and elicit their private information for social good. Furthermore, we also build a persuasion dialog system to persuade people to donate to charities. We release the code and data.\nThe interest in non-collaborative tasks has been increasing and there have already been several related datasets. For instance, BIBREF1 wang2019persuasion collected conversations where one participant persuades another to donate to a charity. BIBREF2 he2018decoupling collected negotiation dialogs where buyers and sellers bargain for items for sale on Craigslist. There are many other non-collaborative tasks, such as the turn-taking game BIBREF6, the multi-party game BIBREF7 and item splitting negotiation BIBREF8. Similar to the AntiScam dataset proposed in this paper, these datasets contain off-task content and can be used to train non-collaborative dialog systems. However, since they are not specifically collected and designed for non-collaborative tasks, it might be difficult to disentangle the on-task and off-task contents and measure the performance. Therefore, we propose the AntiScam dataset, which is designed to interleave the on-task and off-task contents in the conversation, and can serve as a benchmark dataset for similar non-collaborative tasks.\nTo better understand user utterances and separate on-task and off-task content within a conversation, previous work has designed hierarchical annotation schemes for specific domains. BIBREF9 hardy2002multi followed the DAMSL schemeBIBREF10 and annotated a multilingual human-computer dialog corpus with a hierarchical dialog act annotation scheme. BIBREF11 gupta2018semantic used a hierarchical annotation scheme for semantic parsing. Inspired by these studies, our idea is to annotate the intent and semantic slot separately in non-collaborative tasks. We propose a hierarchical intent annotation scheme that can be adopted by all non-collaborative tasks. With this annotation scheme, MISSA is able to quickly build an end-to-end trainable dialog system for any non-collaborative task.\nTraditional task-oriented dialog systems BIBREF12 are usually composed of multiple independent modules, for example, natural language understanding, dialog state tracking BIBREF13, BIBREF14, dialog policy manager BIBREF15, and natural language generation BIBREF16. Conversational intent is adopted to capture the meaning of task content in these dialog systems BIBREF2, BIBREF17. In comparison to this work, we use a hierarchical intent scheme that includes off-task and on-task intents to capture utterance meaning. We also train the model in a multi-task fashion to predict decoupled intents and semantic slots. The major defect of a separately trained pipeline is the laborious dialog state design and annotation. In order to mitigate this problem, recent work has explored replacing independent modules with end-to-end neural networks BIBREF18, BIBREF19, BIBREF20. Our model also follows this end-to-end fashion.\nOver the last few years, we have witnessed a huge growth in non-task-oriented dialog systems BIBREF21, BIBREF22. Social chatbots such as Gunrock BIBREF23 were able to maintain a conversation for around ten minutes in an open domain. Recent improvements build on top of the transformer and pre-trained language models BIBREF24, BIBREF25, BIBREF26, obtained state-of-the-art results on the Persona-Chat dataset BIBREF0. Pre-trained language models are proposed to build task-oriented dialog systems to drive the progress on leveraging large amounts of available unannotated data. BIBREF27. Similarly, our approach is also built on top of the TransferTransfo framework BIBREF0. BIBREF27 budzianowski2019hello focused on collaborative tasks BIBREF28. We target non-collaborative tasks instead.\nAnother line of work interleaves on-task and off-task content by building a hybrid dialog system that combines a task-oriented model and a non-task-oriented model BIBREF4, BIBREF29. In these studies, task-oriented systems and non-task-oriented systems are designed separately and both systems generate candidate responses. A selector is then designed to choose an appropriate output from the candidate responses BIBREF4 and a connector to combine two response candidates BIBREF30, BIBREF31. Compared with these works, MISSA is end-to-end trainable and thus easier to train and update.\nTo decouple syntactic and semantic information in utterances and provide detailed supervision, we design a hierarchical intent annotation scheme for non-collaborative tasks. We first separate on-task and off-task intents. As on-task intents are key actions that can vary among different tasks, we need to specifically define on-task intents for each task. On the other hand, since off-task content is too general to design task-specific intents, we choose common dialog acts as the categories. The advantage of this hierarchical annotation scheme is apparent when starting a new non-collaborative task: we only need to focus on designing the on-task categories and semantic slots which are the same as traditional task-oriented dialog systems. Consequently, we don't have to worry about the off-task annotation design since the off-task category is universal.\nIn the intent annotation scheme shown in Table TABREF2, we list the designed intent annotation scheme for the newly collected AntiScam dataset and the PersuasionForGood dataset. We first define on-task intents for the datasets, which are key actions in the task. Since our AntiScam focuses on understanding and reacting towards elicitations, we define elicitation, providing_information and refusal as on-task intents. In the PersuasionForGood dataset, we define nine on-task intents in Table TABREF2 based on the original PersuasionForGood dialog act annotation scheme. All these intents are related to donation actions, which are salient on-task intents in the persuasion task. The off-task intents are the same for both tasks, including six general intents and six additional social intents. General intents are more closely related to the syntactic meaning of the sentence (open_question, yes_no_question, positive_answer, negative_answer, responsive_statement, and nonresponsive_statement) while social intents are common social actions (greeting, closing, apology, thanking,respond_to_thank, and hold).\nFor specific tasks, we also design a semantic slot annotation scheme for annotating sentences based on their semantic content. We identify 13 main semantic slots in the anti-scam task, for example, credit card numbers. We present a detailed semantic slot annotation in Table TABREF3. Following BIBREF1, we segment each conversation turn into single sentences and then annotate each sentence rather than turns.\nWe test our approach on two non-collaborative task datasets: the AntiScam dataset and the PersuasionForGood dataset BIBREF1. Both datasets are collected from the Amazon Mechanical Turk platform in the form of typing conversations and off-task dialog is interleaved in the dialog.\nTo enrich available non-collaborative task datasets, we created a corpus of human-human anti-scam dialogs in order to learn human elicitation strategies. We chose a popular Amazon customer service scam scenario to collect dialogs between users and attackers who aim to collect users information. We posted a role-playing task on the Amazon Mechanical Turk platform and collected a typing conversation dataset named AntiScam. We collected 220 human-human dialogs. The average conversation length is 12.45 turns and the average utterance length is 11.13 words. Only 172 out of 220 users successfully identified their partner as an attacker, suggesting that the attackers are well trained and not too easily identifiable. We recruited two expert annotators who have linguistic training to annotate 3,044 sentences in 100 dialogs, achieving a 0.874 averaged weighted kappa value.\nThe PersuasionForGood dataset BIBREF1 was collected from typing conversations on Amazon Mechanical Turk platform. Two workers were randomly paired, one was assigned the role of persuader, the other was persuadee. The goal of the persuader was to persuade the persuadee to donate a portion of task earning to a specific charity. The dataset consists of 1,017 dialogs, where 300 dialogs are annotated with dialog acts. The average conversation length is 10.43, the vocabulary size is 8,141. Since the original PersuasionForGood dataset is annotated with dialog acts, we select the on-task dialog acts as on-task intents shown in Table TABREF2, and categorize the other dialog acts into our pre-defined off-task intents.\nThe TransferTransfo framework was proposed to build open domain dialog systems. BIBREF0 wolf2019transfertransfo fine-tuned the generative pre-training model (GPT) BIBREF32 with the PERSONA-CHAT dataset BIBREF33 in a multi-task fashion, where the language model objective is combined with a next-utterance classification task. The language model's objective is to maximize the following likelihood for a given sequence of tokens, $X = \\lbrace x_1,\\dots ,x_n\\rbrace $:\nThe authors also trained a classifier to distinguish the correct next-utterance appended to the input human utterances from a set of randomly selected utterance distractors. In addition, they introduced dialog state embeddings to indicate speaker role in the model. The model significantly outperformed previous baselines over both automatic evaluations and human evaluations in social conversations. Since the TransferTransfo framework performs well in open domain, we adapt it for non-collaborative settings. We keep all the embeddings in the framework and train the language model and next-utterance classification task in a multi-task fashion following TransferTransfo.\nWe make two major changes: (1) To address the problem that TransferTransfo is originally designed for an open domain without explicit intents and regulations, we add two intent classifiers and two semantic slot classifiers to classify the intents and semantic slots for both human utterances and system responses as an effort to incorporate the proposed hierarchical intent and semantic slot annotation for non-collaborative tasks. (2) In dialog systems, multiple generated responses can be coherent under the current context. Generating diverse responses has proven to be an enduring challenge. To increase response diversity, we sample multiple generated responses and choose an appropriate one according to a set of pre-defined rules.\nWe train MISSA in a multi-task fashion. In addition to the language model task and the next-utterance prediction task, we also use separate classifiers to predict the intents and semantic slots of both human utterances and system responses. The intent classifier and semantic slot classifier for human utterances capture the semantic and syntactic meaning of human utterances, providing information to select the appropriate response among response candidates while the classifiers for the system intents and semantic slots are designed to help select an appropriate next-sentence. We describe response filtering in the corresponding subsection. Classifiers are designed as the following equation:\nwhere $L^i_{t}$ is the intent or semantic label of $i$-th sentence at turn $t$. $h^l_{t-1}$ is the hidden states at the end of last sentence in turn $t-1$, $h^i_{t}$ is the last hidden states at the end of $i$-th sentence in turn $t$. $W_{2h}$ are weights learned during training.\nMISSA is able to classify multiple intents and multiple semantic slots in a single utterance with these classifiers. Figure FIGREF6 shows how it works on the AntiScam dataset. Specifically, we set a special token $<$sep$>$ at the end of each sentence in an utterance (an utterance can consist of multiple sentences). Next, we pass the token's position information to the transformer architecture and obtain the representation of the position (represented as colored position at last layer in Figure FIGREF6). After that, we concatenate the embeddings at these position with the hidden states of last sentence. We pass these concatenated representations to the intent classifier and the slot classifier to obtain an intent and a semantic slot for each sentence in the utterance. As shown in Figure FIGREF6, the loss function ${\\mathcal {L}}$ for the model combines all the task losses:\nwhere ${\\mathcal {L}_{LM}}$ is the language model loss, ${\\mathcal {L}_{I_h}}$, ${\\mathcal {L}_{S_h}}$, ${\\mathcal {L}_{I_s}}$, and ${\\mathcal {L}_{S_s}}$ are losses of intent and slots classifiers, ${\\mathcal {L}_{nup}}$ is next-utterance classification loss. $\\lambda _{LM}$, $\\lambda _{I_h}$, $\\lambda _{S_h}$, $\\lambda _{I_s}$, $\\lambda _{S_s}$, and $\\lambda _{nup}$ are the hyper-parameters that control the relative importance of every loss.\nMISSA can generate multiple sentences in a single system turn. Therefore, we perform system generation conditioned on predicted system intents. More specifically, during the training phase, in addition to inserting a special $<$sep$>$ token at the end of each sentence, we also insert the intent of the system response as special tokens at the head of each sentence in the system response. For example, in Figure FIGREF6, we insert a $<$pos_ans$>$ token at the head of $S_t^1$, which is the system response in green. We then use a cross entropy loss function to calculate the loss between the predicted token and the ground truth intent token. During the testing phase, the model first generates a special intent token, then after being conditioned on this intent token, the model keeps generating a sentence until it generates a $<$sep$>$ token. After that, the model continues to generate another intent token and another sentence until it generates an $<$eos$>$ token.\nSince we only perform conditional generation, a type of soft constraint on the predicted intent of system response, the system can still generate samples that violate simple conversation regulations, such as eliciting information that has already been provided. These corner cases may lead to fatal results in high-risk tasks, for example, health care and education. To improve the robustness of MISSA and improve its ability to generalize to more tasks, we add a response filtering module after the generation. With the nucleus sampling strategy BIBREF5, MISSA is able to generate multiple diverse candidate responses with different intents and semantic slots. We then adopt a task-specific response filtering policy to choose the best candidate response as the final output. In our anti-scam scenario, we set up a few simple rules to filter out some unreasonable candidates, for instance, eliciting the repeated information. The filtering module is easily adaptable to different domains or specific requirements, which makes our dialog system more controllable.\nWe evaluate MISSA on two non-collaborative task datasets. AntiScam aims to build a dialog system that occupies the attacker's attention and elicits the attacker's information while PersuasionForGood BIBREF1 aims to build a dialog system that persuades people to donate to a charity. We use $80\\%$ data for training, $10\\%$ data for validation, and $10\\%$ data for testing. More training details are presented in Appendix.\nWe compare MISSA mainly with two baseline models:\nTransferTransfo The vanilla TransferTransfo framework is compared with MISSA to show the impact and necessity of adding the intent and slot classifiers. We follow the original TransferTransfo design BIBREF0 and train with undelexicalized data.\nHybrid Following BIBREF4 yu2017learning, we also build a hybrid dialog system by combining vanilla TransferTransfo and MISSA. Specifically, we first determine if the human utterances are on-task or off-task with human intent classifier. If the classifier decides that the utterance is on-task, we choose the response from MISSA; otherwise, we choose the response from vanilla TransferTransfo baseline.\nIn addition, we perform ablation studies on MISSA to show the effects of different components.\nMISSA-sel denotes MISSA without response filtering.\nMISSA-con denotes MISSA leaving out the intent token at the start of the response generation.\nPerplexity Since the canonical measure of a good language model is perplexity, which indicates the error rate of the expected word. We choose perplexity to evaluate the model performance.\nResponse-Intent Prediction (RIP) $\\&$ Response-Slot Prediction (RSP) Different from open-domain dialog systems, we care about the intents of the system response in non-collaborative tasks as we hope to know if the system response satisfies user intents. For example, in the anti-scam task, if the attacker elicits information from the system, we need to know if the system refuses or agrees to provide the information. Therefore we care about intent prediction for the generated system response. Since our baselines are more suited for social chat as they cannot produce system intents, we use the system intent and slot classifiers trained in our model to predict their responses' intents and slots. The intent predictor achieves a $84\\%$ accuracy and the semantic slot predictor achieves $77\\%$ on the AntiScam dataset. Then we compare the predicted values with human-annotated ground truth in the dataset to compute the response-intent prediction (RIP) and response-slot prediction (RSP).\nExtended Response-Intent Prediction (ERIP) $\\&$ Extended Response-Slot Prediction (ERSP) With Response-Intent Prediction, we verify the predicted intents to evaluate the coherence of the dialog. However, the real mapping between human-intent and system-intent is much more complicated as there might be multiple acceptable system-intents for the same human-intent. Therefore, we also design a metric to evaluate if the predicted system-intent is in the set of acceptable intents. Specifically, we estimate the transition probability $p(I_i|I_j)$ by counting the frequency of all the bi-gram human-intent and system-intent pairs in the training data. During the test stage, if the predicted intent matches the ground truth, we set the score as 1, otherwise we set the score as $p(I_{predict}|I_i)$ where $I_i$ is the intent of the input human utterance. We then report the average value of those scores over turns as the final extended response-intent prediction result.\nAutomatic metrics only validate the system\u2019s performance on a single dimension at a time. The ultimate holistic evaluation should be conducted by having the trained system interact with human users. Therefore we also conduct human evaluations for the dialog system built on AntiScam. We test our models and baselines with 15 college-student volunteers. Each of them is asked to pretend to be an attacker and interact with all the models for at least three times to avoid randomness. We in total collect 225 number of dialogs. Each time, volunteers are required to use similar sentences and strategies to interact with all five models and score each model based on the metrics listed below at the end of the current round. Each model receives a total of 45 human ratings, and the average score is reported as the final human-evaluation score. In total, we design five different metrics to assess the models' conversational ability whilst interacting with humans. The results are shown in Table TABREF19.\nFluency Fluency is used to explore different models' language generation quality.\nCoherence Different from single sentence's fluency, coherence focuses more on the logical consistency between sentences in each turn.\nEngagement In the anti-scam scenario, one of our missions is to keep engaging with the attackers to waste their time. So we directly ask volunteers (attackers) to what extend they would like to continue chatting with the system.\nDialog length (Length) Engagement is a subjective metric. Anti-scam system's goal is to engage user in the conversation longer in order to limit their harm to other potential victims. So we count the dialog length as another metric to evaluate system performance.\nTask Success Score (TaskSuc) The other goal of the anti-scam system is to elicit attacker's personal information. We count the average type of information (name, address and phone number) that the system obtained from attackers as the task success score.\nTable TABREF19 presents the main experiment results on AntiScam dataset, for both automatic evaluation metrics and human evaluation metrics. The experiment results on PersuasionForGood are shown in Table TABREF23. We observe that MISSA outperforms two baseline models (TransferTransfo and hybrid model) on almost all the metrics on both datasets. For further analysis, examples of real dialogs from the human evaluation are presented in Table TABREF21.\nCompared to the first TransferTransfo baseline, MISSA outperforms the TransferTransfo baseline on the on-task contents. From Table TABREF19, we observe that MISSA maintains longer conversations (14.9 turns) compared with TransferTransfo (8.5 turns), which means MISSA is better at maintaining the attacker's engagement. MISSA also has a higher task success score (1.294) than TransferTransfo (1.025), which indicates that it elicits information more strategically. In the top two dialogs (A and B) that are shown in Table TABREF21, both attackers were eliciting a credit card number in their first turns. TransferTransfo directly gave away the information, while MISSA replied with a semantically-related question \u201cwhy would you need my credit card number?\" Furthermore, in the next turn, TransferTransfo ignored the context and asked an irrelevant question \u201cwhat is your name?\u201d while MISSA was able to generate the response \u201cwhy can't you use my address?\u201d, which is consistent to the context. We suspect the improved performance of MISSA comes from our proposed annotation scheme: the semantic slot information enables MISSA to keep track of the current entities, and the intent information helps MISSA to maintain coherency and prolong conversations.\nCompared to the hybrid model baseline, MISSA performs better on off-task content. As shown in the bottom two dialogs in Table TABREF21, attackers in both dialogs introduced their names in their first utterances. MISSA recognized attacker's name, while the hybrid model did not. We suspect it is because the hybrid model does not have the built-in semantic slot predictor. In the second turn, both attackers were explaining the reason of requesting the billing address previously. With semantic slot information, MISSA can easily understand the attacker; but the hybrid model misunderstands that the attacker was talking about the order number, possibly because the token \u201corder\u201d appeared in the attacker's utterance. We suspect that the hybrid model's bad performance on the off-task content leads to its low coherence rating (2.76) and short dialog length (8.2).\nTo explore the influence of the intent-based conditional response generation method and the designed response filter, we perform an ablation study. The results are shown in Table TABREF19. We find that MISSA has higher fluency score and coherence score than MISSA-con (4.18 vs 3.78 for fluency, and 3.75 vs 3.68 for coherence), which suggests that conditioning on the system intent to generate responses improves the quality of the generated sentences. Compared with MISSA-sel, MISSA achieves better performance on all the metrics. For example, the engagement score for MISSA is 3.69 while MISSA-sel only has 2.87. This is because the response filter removed all the incoherent responses, which makes the attacker more willing to keep chatting. The ablation study shows both the conditional language generation mechanism and the response filter are essential to MISSA's good performance.\nWe also apply our method to the PersuasionForGood dataset. As shown in Table TABREF23, MISSA and its variants outperform the TransferTransfo and the hybrid models on all evaluation metrics. Such good performance indicates MISSA can be easily applied to a different non-collaborative task and achieve good performance. Particularly, MISSA achieves the lowest perplexity, which confirms that using conditional response generation leads to high quality responses. Compared with the result on AntiScam dataset, MISSA-con performs the best in terms of RIP and ERIP. We suspect the underlying reason is that there are more possible responses with the same intent in PersuasionForGood than in AntiScam. This also suggests that we should adjust the model structure according to the nature of the dataset.\nWe propose a general dialog system pipeline to build non-collaborative dialog systems, including a hierarchical annotation scheme and an end-to-end neural response generation model called MISSA. With the hierarchical annotation scheme, we can distinguish on-task and off-task intents. MISSA takes both on and off-task intents as supervision in its training and thus can deal with diverse user utterances in non-collaborative settings. Moreover, to validate MISSA's performance, we create a non-collaborate dialog dataset that focuses on deterring phone scammers. MISSA outperforms all baseline methods in terms of fluency, coherency, and user engagement on both the newly proposed anti-scam task and an existing persuasion task. However, MISSA still produces responses that are not consistent with their distant conversation history as GPT can only track a limited history span. In future work, we plan to address this issue by developing methods that can effectively track longer dialog context.\nThis work was supported by DARPA ASED Program HR001117S0050.

The views and conclusions contained herein are those of the authors and should not be interpreted as necessarily representing the official policies, either expressed or implied, of DARPA or the U.S. Government.\nWe randomly pair two workers: one is assigned the role of the attacker to elicit user information, and the other one is assigned the role of an everyday user who aims to protect her/his information and potentially elicit the attacker's information. We give both workers specific personal data. Instructions are shown in Table TABREF24. The \u201cattacker\u201d additionally receives training on how to elicit information from people. Workers cannot see their partners' instructions.\nThere are two tasks for the users: firstly, users are required to chat with their partners and determine if they are attackers or not, reporting their decisions at the end of the task. If users think their partners are attackers, they are instructed to prolong the conversation and elicit information from their partners. We give a bonus to users if they detect the attackers and elicit real information from the attackers, including the attacker's name, address and phone number. Since one worker can only participate once in the task, they do not know their partners are always attackers.\nWe provide real user information including the user's name and the task background (user purchased a product on Amazon) . Attackers are well-trained to pretend to be an Amazon customer service agent. To simulate a real-world scam, we tell attackers some details about the user, such as the user's name to stop them from being too easily identified. We give a bonus to attackers if they elicit correct information from users, including the user's address, credit card number, CVS and expiration date. Each worker can only participate once to prevent workers from knowing their partner's information and goals in advance. We collected 220 human-human dialogs. The average conversation length is 12.45 turns and the average utterance length is 11.13 words. Only 172 out of 220 users successfully identified their partner as an attacker, suggesting that the attackers are well trained and not too easily identifiable.\nWe recruited two expert annotators who have linguistic training to annotate 3,044 sentences in 100 dialogs, achieving a 0.874 averaged weighted kappa value. Table TABREF2 shows that there is a vast amount of off-task content in the dataset, which confirms the necessity of a hierarchical on-task/off-task annotation scheme. We observe that sentences from the attacker and user have different intent distributions. Compared to attackers, users produce more refusal (74 vs 19), because users are more likely to refuse to provide requested information if they have detected the attacker. Moreover, users also ask more open_questions (173 vs 54) and yes_no_questions (165 vs 117) for off-task content because they are instructed to prolong the conversation after detecting the attacker. Furthermore, attackers and users both have a massive amount of social content (292 in total and 252 in total), suggesting that it is important to have social intent sentences to maintain the conversation.\nMISSA is based on the generative pre-trained transformer BIBREF32. We use an Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 6.25e-5 and $L2$ weight decay of $0.01$, we set the coefficient of language modeling loss to be 2, the coefficient of intent and slot classifiers to be 1, and the coefficient of next-utterance classifier to be 1. We first pre-train the model on the PERSONA-CHAT dataset. When fine-tuning on the AntiScam and the PersuasionForGood datasets, we use $80\\%$ data for training, $10\\%$ data for validation, and $10\\%$ data for testing. Since the original PersuasionForGood dataset is annotated with intents, we separate the original on-task and off-task intents, which are shown in Table TABREF2. To deal with the words out of the vocabulary, we conduct delexicalization to replace slot values with corresponding slot tokens during the training phase, and replace the slot tokens with pre-defined information during testing.\nAn example of human-human chat on AntiScam dataset is shown in Table TABREF25.", "question": "What are the baselines outperformed by this work?", "expected_output": "TransferTransfo and Hybrid.

{"id": "1911.10742", "prompt": "Considerable progress has been made building end-to-end dialog systems for collaborative tasks in which users cooperate with the system to achieve a common goal. Examples of collaborative tasks include making restaurant reservations and retrieving bus time-table information. Since users typically have clear and explicit intentions in collaborative tasks, existing systems commonly classify user utterances into pre-defined intents. In contrast, non-collaborative tasks are those where the users and the system do not strive to achieve the same goal. Examples of such tasks include deceiving attackers, persuading users to donate to a cause BIBREF1, and negotiating a product price BIBREF2, BIBREF3. In these tasks, users often perform complex actions that are beyond a simple set of pre-defined intents. In order to reach a common state, the user and the system need to build rapport and trust which naturally involves off-task content. Previous work did not model off-task content BIBREF2, which may have led to less optimal results. For example, in the persuasion task BIBREF1, users would ask the system \u201cHow do you feel about war?\" An example of an on-task system response that the system could have made is \u201cDo you want to make a donation?\", which sticks to the task but neglects users' question. However, a better response to such an off-task question is \u201cWar is destructive and pitiless, but you can donate to help child victims of war.\" This response is better, as it has been found that users are more likely to end the conversation if the system neglects their questions BIBREF4. Therefore, we need to design a system that handles both on-task and off-task information appropriately and in a way that leads back to the system's goal.\nTo tackle the issue of incoherent system responses to off-task content, previous studies have built hybrid systems to interleave off-task and on-task content. BIBREF4 used a rule-based dialog manager for on-task content and a neural model for off-task content, and trained a reinforcement learning model to select between these two models based on the dialog context. However, such a method is difficult to train and struggles to generalize beyond the movie promotion task they considered. To tackle these problems, we propose a hierarchical intent annotation scheme that separates on-task and off-task information in order to provide detailed supervision. For on-task information, we directly use task-related intents for representation. Off-task information, on the other hand, is too general to categorize into specific intents, so we choose dialog acts that convey syntax information. These acts, such as \u201copen question\" are general to all tasks.\nPrevious studies use template-based methods to maintain sentence coherence. However, rigid templates lead to limited diversity, causing the user losing engagement. On the other hand, language generation models can generate diverse responses but are bad at being coherent. We propose Multiple Intents and Semantic Slots Annotation Neural Network (MISSA) to combine the advantages of both template and generation models and takes advantage from the hierarchical annotation at the same time. MISSA follows the TransferTransfo framework BIBREF0 with three modifications: (i) We first concurrently predict user's, system's intents and semantic slots; (ii) We then perform conditional generation to improve generated response's coherence. Specifically, we generate responses conditioned on the above intermediate representation (intents and slots); (iii) Finally, we generate multiple responses with the nucleus sampling strategy BIBREF5 and then apply a response filter, which contains a set of pre-defined constraints to select coherent responses. The constraints in the filter can be defined according to specific task requirements or general conversational rules.\nTo enrich publicly available non-collaborative task datasets, we collect a new dataset AntiScam, where users defend themselves against attackers trying to collect personal information. As non-collaborative tasks are still relatively new to the study of dialog systems, there are insufficiently many meaningful datasets for evaluation and we hope this provides a valuable example. We evaluate MISSA on the newly collected AntiScam dataset and an existing PersuasionForGood dataset. Both automatic and human evaluations suggest that MISSA outperforms multiple competitive baselines.\nIn summary, our contributions include: (i) We design a hierarchical intent annotation scheme and a semantic slot annotation scheme to annotate the non-collaborative dialog dataset, we also propose a carefully-designed AntiScam dataset to facilitate the research of non-collaborative dialog systems. (ii) We propose a model that can be applied to all non-collaborative tasks, outperforming other baselines on two different non-collaborative tasks. (iii) We develop an anti-scam dialog system to occupy attacker's attention and elicit their private information for social good. Furthermore, we also build a persuasion dialog system to persuade people to donate to charities. We release the code and data.\nThe interest in non-collaborative tasks has been increasing and there have already been several related datasets. For instance, BIBREF1 wang2019persuasion collected conversations where one participant persuades another to donate to a charity. BIBREF2 he2018decoupling collected negotiation dialogs where buyers and sellers bargain for items for sale on Craigslist. There are many other non-collaborative tasks, such as the turn-taking game BIBREF6, the multi-party game BIBREF7 and item splitting negotiation BIBREF8. Similar to the AntiScam dataset proposed in this paper, these datasets contain off-task content and can be used to train non-collaborative dialog systems. However, since they are not specifically collected and designed for non-collaborative tasks, it might be difficult to disentangle the on-task and off-task contents and measure the performance. Therefore, we propose the AntiScam dataset, which is designed to interleave the on-task and off-task contents in the conversation, and can serve as a benchmark dataset for similar non-collaborative tasks.\nTo better understand user utterances and separate on-task and off-task content within a conversation, previous work has designed hierarchical annotation schemes for specific domains. BIBREF9 hardy2002multi followed the DAMSL schemeBIBREF10 and annotated a multilingual human-computer dialog corpus with a hierarchical dialog act annotation scheme. BIBREF11 gupta2018semantic used a hierarchical annotation scheme for semantic parsing. Inspired by these studies, our idea is to annotate the intent and semantic slot separately in non-collaborative tasks. We propose a hierarchical intent annotation scheme that can be adopted by all non-collaborative tasks. With this annotation scheme, MISSA is able to quickly build an end-to-end trainable dialog system for any non-collaborative task.\nTraditional task-oriented dialog systems BIBREF12 are usually composed of multiple independent modules, for example, natural language understanding, dialog state tracking BIBREF13, BIBREF14, dialog policy manager BIBREF15, and natural language generation BIBREF16. Conversational intent is adopted to capture the meaning of task content in these dialog systems BIBREF2, BIBREF17. In comparison to this work, we use a hierarchical intent scheme that includes off-task and on-task intents to capture utterance meaning. We also train the model in a multi-task fashion to predict decoupled intents and semantic slots. The major defect of a separately trained pipeline is the laborious dialog state design and annotation. In order to mitigate this problem, recent work has explored replacing independent modules with end-to-end neural networks BIBREF18, BIBREF19, BIBREF20. Our model also follows this end-to-end fashion.\nOver the last few years, we have witnessed a huge growth in non-task-oriented dialog systems BIBREF21, BIBREF22. Social chatbots such as Gunrock BIBREF23 were able to maintain a conversation for around ten minutes in an open domain. Recent improvements build on top of the transformer and pre-trained language models BIBREF24, BIBREF25, BIBREF26, obtained state-of-the-art results on the Persona-Chat dataset BIBREF0. Pre-trained language models are proposed to build task-oriented dialog systems to drive the progress on leveraging large amounts of available unannotated data. BIBREF27. Similarly, our approach is also built on top of the TransferTransfo framework BIBREF0. BIBREF27 budzianowski2019hello focused on collaborative tasks BIBREF28. We target non-collaborative tasks instead.\nAnother line of work interleaves on-task and off-task content by building a hybrid dialog system that combines a task-oriented model and a non-task-oriented model BIBREF4, BIBREF29. In these studies, task-oriented systems and non-task-oriented systems are designed separately and both systems generate candidate responses. A selector is then designed to choose an appropriate output from the candidate responses BIBREF4 and a connector to combine two response candidates BIBREF30, BIBREF31. Compared with these works, MISSA is end-to-end trainable and thus easier to train and update.\nTo decouple syntactic and semantic information in utterances and provide detailed supervision, we design a hierarchical intent annotation scheme for non-collaborative tasks. We first separate on-task and off-task intents. As on-task intents are key actions that can vary among different tasks, we need to specifically define on-task intents for each task. On the other hand, since off-task content is too general to design task-specific intents, we choose common dialog acts as the categories. The advantage of this hierarchical annotation scheme is apparent when starting a new non-collaborative task: we only need to focus on designing the on-task categories and semantic slots which are the same as traditional task-oriented dialog systems. Consequently, we don't have to worry about the off-task annotation design since the off-task category is universal.\nIn the intent annotation scheme shown in Table TABREF2, we list the designed intent annotation scheme for the newly collected AntiScam dataset and the PersuasionForGood dataset. We first define on-task intents for the datasets, which are key actions in the task. Since our AntiScam focuses on understanding and reacting towards elicitations, we define elicitation, providing_information and refusal as on-task intents. In the PersuasionForGood dataset, we define nine on-task intents in Table TABREF2 based on the original PersuasionForGood dialog act annotation scheme. All these intents are related to donation actions, which are salient on-task intents in the persuasion task. The off-task intents are the same for both tasks, including six general intents and six additional social intents. General intents are more closely related to the syntactic meaning of the sentence (open_question, yes_no_question, positive_answer, negative_answer, responsive_statement, and nonresponsive_statement) while social intents are common social actions (greeting, closing, apology, thanking,respond_to_thank, and hold).\nFor specific tasks, we also design a semantic slot annotation scheme for annotating sentences based on their semantic content. We identify 13 main semantic slots in the anti-scam task, for example, credit card numbers. We present a detailed semantic slot annotation in Table TABREF3. Following BIBREF1, we segment each conversation turn into single sentences and then annotate each sentence rather than turns.\nWe test our approach on two non-collaborative task datasets: the AntiScam dataset and the PersuasionForGood dataset BIBREF1. Both datasets are collected from the Amazon Mechanical Turk platform in the form of typing conversations and off-task dialog is interleaved in the dialog.\nTo enrich available non-collaborative task datasets, we created a corpus of human-human anti-scam dialogs in order to learn human elicitation strategies. We chose a popular Amazon customer service scam scenario to collect dialogs between users and attackers who aim to collect users information. We posted a role-playing task on the Amazon Mechanical Turk platform and collected a typing conversation dataset named AntiScam. We collected 220 human-human dialogs. The average conversation length is 12.45 turns and the average utterance length is 11.13 words. Only 172 out of 220 users successfully identified their partner as an attacker, suggesting that the attackers are well trained and not too easily identifiable. We recruited two expert annotators who have linguistic training to annotate 3,044 sentences in 100 dialogs, achieving a 0.874 averaged weighted kappa value.\nThe PersuasionForGood dataset BIBREF1 was collected from typing conversations on Amazon Mechanical Turk platform. Two workers were randomly paired, one was assigned the role of persuader, the other was persuadee. The goal of the persuader was to persuade the persuadee to donate a portion of task earning to a specific charity. The dataset consists of 1,017 dialogs, where 300 dialogs are annotated with dialog acts. The average conversation length is 10.43, the vocabulary size is 8,141. Since the original PersuasionForGood dataset is annotated with dialog acts, we select the on-task dialog acts as on-task intents shown in Table TABREF2, and categorize the other dialog acts into our pre-defined off-task intents.\nThe TransferTransfo framework was proposed to build open domain dialog systems. BIBREF0 wolf2019transfertransfo fine-tuned the generative pre-training model (GPT) BIBREF32 with the PERSONA-CHAT dataset BIBREF33 in a multi-task fashion, where the language model objective is combined with a next-utterance classification task. The language model's objective is to maximize the following likelihood for a given sequence of tokens, $X = \\lbrace x_1,\\dots ,x_n\\rbrace $:\nThe authors also trained a classifier to distinguish the correct next-utterance appended to the input human utterances from a set of randomly selected utterance distractors. In addition, they introduced dialog state embeddings to indicate speaker role in the model. The model significantly outperformed previous baselines over both automatic evaluations and human evaluations in social conversations. Since the TransferTransfo framework performs well in open domain, we adapt it for non-collaborative settings. We keep all the embeddings in the framework and train the language model and next-utterance classification task in a multi-task fashion following TransferTransfo.\nWe make two major changes: (1) To address the problem that TransferTransfo is originally designed for an open domain without explicit intents and regulations, we add two intent classifiers and two semantic slot classifiers to classify the intents and semantic slots for both human utterances and system responses as an effort to incorporate the proposed hierarchical intent and semantic slot annotation for non-collaborative tasks. (2) In dialog systems, multiple generated responses can be coherent under the current context. Generating diverse responses has proven to be an enduring challenge. To increase response diversity, we sample multiple generated responses and choose an appropriate one according to a set of pre-defined rules.\nWe train MISSA in a multi-task fashion. In addition to the language model task and the next-utterance prediction task, we also use separate classifiers to predict the intents and semantic slots of both human utterances and system responses. The intent classifier and semantic slot classifier for human utterances capture the semantic and syntactic meaning of human utterances, providing information to select the appropriate response among response candidates while the classifiers for the system intents and semantic slots are designed to help select an appropriate next-sentence. We describe response filtering in the corresponding subsection. Classifiers are designed as the following equation:\nwhere $L^i_{t}$ is the intent or semantic label of $i$-th sentence at turn $t$. $h^l_{t-1}$ is the hidden states at the end of last sentence in turn $t-1$, $h^i_{t}$ is the last hidden states at the end of $i$-th sentence in turn $t$. $W_{2h}$ are weights learned during training.\nMISSA is able to classify multiple intents and multiple semantic slots in a single utterance with these classifiers. Figure FIGREF6 shows how it works on the AntiScam dataset. Specifically, we set a special token $<$sep$>$ at the end of each sentence in an utterance (an utterance can consist of multiple sentences). Next, we pass the token's position information to the transformer architecture and obtain the representation of the position (represented as colored position at last layer in Figure FIGREF6). After that, we concatenate the embeddings at these position with the hidden states of last sentence. We pass these concatenated representations to the intent classifier and the slot classifier to obtain an intent and a semantic slot for each sentence in the utterance. As shown in Figure FIGREF6, the loss function ${\\mathcal {L}}$ for the model combines all the task losses:\nwhere ${\\mathcal {L}_{LM}}$ is the language model loss, ${\\mathcal {L}_{I_h}}$, ${\\mathcal {L}_{S_h}}$, ${\\mathcal {L}_{I_s}}$, and ${\\mathcal {L}_{S_s}}$ are losses of intent and slots classifiers, ${\\mathcal {L}_{nup}}$ is next-utterance classification loss. $\\lambda _{LM}$, $\\lambda _{I_h}$, $\\lambda _{S_h}$, $\\lambda _{I_s}$, $\\lambda _{S_s}$, and $\\lambda _{nup}$ are the hyper-parameters that control the relative importance of every loss.\nMISSA can generate multiple sentences in a single system turn. Therefore, we perform system generation conditioned on predicted system intents. More specifically, during the training phase, in addition to inserting a special $<$sep$>$ token at the end of each sentence, we also insert the intent of the system response as special tokens at the head of each sentence in the system response. For example, in Figure FIGREF6, we insert a $<$pos_ans$>$ token at the head of $S_t^1$, which is the system response in green. We then use a cross entropy loss function to calculate the loss between the predicted token and the ground truth intent token. During the testing phase, the model first generates a special intent token, then after being conditioned on this intent token, the model keeps generating a sentence until it generates a $<$sep$>$ token. After that, the model continues to generate another intent token and another sentence until it generates an $<$eos$>$ token.\nSince we only perform conditional generation, a type of soft constraint on the predicted intent of system response, the system can still generate samples that violate simple conversation regulations, such as eliciting information that has already been provided. These corner cases may lead to fatal results in high-risk tasks, for example, health care and education. To improve the robustness of MISSA and improve its ability to generalize to more tasks, we add a response filtering module after the generation. With the nucleus sampling strategy BIBREF5, MISSA is able to generate multiple diverse candidate responses with different intents and semantic slots. We then adopt a task-specific response filtering policy to choose the best candidate response as the final output. In our anti-scam scenario, we set up a few simple rules to filter out some unreasonable candidates, for instance, eliciting the repeated information. The filtering module is easily adaptable to different domains or specific requirements, which makes our dialog system more controllable.\nWe evaluate MISSA on two non-collaborative task datasets. AntiScam aims to build a dialog system that occupies the attacker's attention and elicits the attacker's information while PersuasionForGood BIBREF1 aims to build a dialog system that persuades people to donate to a charity. We use $80\\%$ data for training, $10\\%$ data for validation, and $10\\%$ data for testing. More training details are presented in Appendix.\nWe compare MISSA mainly with two baseline models:\nTransferTransfo The vanilla TransferTransfo framework is compared with MISSA to show the impact and necessity of adding the intent and slot classifiers. We follow the original TransferTransfo design BIBREF0 and train with undelexicalized data.\nHybrid Following BIBREF4 yu2017learning, we also build a hybrid dialog system by combining vanilla TransferTransfo and MISSA. Specifically, we first determine if the human utterances are on-task or off-task with human intent classifier. If the classifier decides that the utterance is on-task, we choose the response from MISSA; otherwise, we choose the response from vanilla TransferTransfo baseline.\nIn addition, we perform ablation studies on MISSA to show the effects of different components.\nMISSA-sel denotes MISSA without response filtering.\nMISSA-con denotes MISSA leaving out the intent token at the start of the response generation.\nPerplexity Since the canonical measure of a good language model is perplexity, which indicates the error rate of the expected word. We choose perplexity to evaluate the model performance.\nResponse-Intent Prediction (RIP) $\\&$ Response-Slot Prediction (RSP) Different from open-domain dialog systems, we care about the intents of the system response in non-collaborative tasks as we hope to know if the system response satisfies user intents. For example, in the anti-scam task, if the attacker elicits information from the system, we need to know if the system refuses or agrees to provide the information. Therefore we care about intent prediction for the generated system response. Since our baselines are more suited for social chat as they cannot produce system intents, we use the system intent and slot classifiers trained in our model to predict their responses' intents and slots. The intent predictor achieves a $84\\%$ accuracy and the semantic slot predictor achieves $77\\%$ on the AntiScam dataset. Then we compare the predicted values with human-annotated ground truth in the dataset to compute the response-intent prediction (RIP) and response-slot prediction (RSP).\nExtended Response-Intent Prediction (ERIP) $\\&$ Extended Response-Slot Prediction (ERSP) With Response-Intent Prediction, we verify the predicted intents to evaluate the coherence of the dialog. However, the real mapping between human-intent and system-intent is much more complicated as there might be multiple acceptable system-intents for the same human-intent. Therefore, we also design a metric to evaluate if the predicted system-intent is in the set of acceptable intents. Specifically, we estimate the transition probability $p(I_i|I_j)$ by counting the frequency of all the bi-gram human-intent and system-intent pairs in the training data. During the test stage, if the predicted intent matches the ground truth, we set the score as 1, otherwise we set the score as $p(I_{predict}|I_i)$ where $I_i$ is the intent of the input human utterance. We then report the average value of those scores over turns as the final extended response-intent prediction result.\nAutomatic metrics only validate the system\u2019s performance on a single dimension at a time. The ultimate holistic evaluation should be conducted by having the trained system interact with human users. Therefore we also conduct human evaluations for the dialog system built on AntiScam. We test our models and baselines with 15 college-student volunteers. Each of them is asked to pretend to be an attacker and interact with all the models for at least three times to avoid randomness. We in total collect 225 number of dialogs. Each time, volunteers are required to use similar sentences and strategies to interact with all five models and score each model based on the metrics listed below at the end of the current round. Each model receives a total of 45 human ratings, and the average score is reported as the final human-evaluation score. In total, we design five different metrics to assess the models' conversational ability whilst interacting with humans. The results are shown in Table TABREF19.\nFluency Fluency is used to explore different models' language generation quality.\nCoherence Different from single sentence's fluency, coherence focuses more on the logical consistency between sentences in each turn.\nEngagement In the anti-scam scenario, one of our missions is to keep engaging with the attackers to waste their time. So we directly ask volunteers (attackers) to what extend they would like to continue chatting with the system.\nDialog length (Length) Engagement is a subjective metric. Anti-scam system's goal is to engage user in the conversation longer in order to limit their harm to other potential victims. So we count the dialog length as another metric to evaluate system performance.\nTask Success Score (TaskSuc) The other goal of the anti-scam system is to elicit attacker's personal information. We count the average type of information (name, address and phone number) that the system obtained from attackers as the task success score.\nTable TABREF19 presents the main experiment results on AntiScam dataset, for both automatic evaluation metrics and human evaluation metrics. The experiment results on PersuasionForGood are shown in Table TABREF23. We observe that MISSA outperforms two baseline models (TransferTransfo and hybrid model) on almost all the metrics on both datasets. For further analysis, examples of real dialogs from the human evaluation are presented in Table TABREF21.\nCompared to the first TransferTransfo baseline, MISSA outperforms the TransferTransfo baseline on the on-task contents. From Table TABREF19, we observe that MISSA maintains longer conversations (14.9 turns) compared with TransferTransfo (8.5 turns), which means MISSA is better at maintaining the attacker's engagement. MISSA also has a higher task success score (1.294) than TransferTransfo (1.025), which indicates that it elicits information more strategically. In the top two dialogs (A and B) that are shown in Table TABREF21, both attackers were eliciting a credit card number in their first turns. TransferTransfo directly gave away the information, while MISSA replied with a semantically-related question \u201cwhy would you need my credit card number?\" Furthermore, in the next turn, TransferTransfo ignored the context and asked an irrelevant question \u201cwhat is your name?\u201d while MISSA was able to generate the response \u201cwhy can't you use my address?\u201d, which is consistent to the context. We suspect the improved performance of MISSA comes from our proposed annotation scheme: the semantic slot information enables MISSA to keep track of the current entities, and the intent information helps MISSA to maintain coherency and prolong conversations.\nCompared to the hybrid model baseline, MISSA performs better on off-task content. As shown in the bottom two dialogs in Table TABREF21, attackers in both dialogs introduced their names in their first utterances. MISSA recognized attacker's name, while the hybrid model did not. We suspect it is because the hybrid model does not have the built-in semantic slot predictor. In the second turn, both attackers were explaining the reason of requesting the billing address previously. With semantic slot information, MISSA can easily understand the attacker; but the hybrid model misunderstands that the attacker was talking about the order number, possibly because the token \u201corder\u201d appeared in the attacker's utterance. We suspect that the hybrid model's bad performance on the off-task content leads to its low coherence rating (2.76) and short dialog length (8.2).\nTo explore the influence of the intent-based conditional response generation method and the designed response filter, we perform an ablation study. The results are shown in Table TABREF19. We find that MISSA has higher fluency score and coherence score than MISSA-con (4.18 vs 3.78 for fluency, and 3.75 vs 3.68 for coherence), which suggests that conditioning on the system intent to generate responses improves the quality of the generated sentences. Compared with MISSA-sel, MISSA achieves better performance on all the metrics. For example, the engagement score for MISSA is 3.69 while MISSA-sel only has 2.87. This is because the response filter removed all the incoherent responses, which makes the attacker more willing to keep chatting. The ablation study shows both the conditional language generation mechanism and the response filter are essential to MISSA's good performance.\nWe also apply our method to the PersuasionForGood dataset. As shown in Table TABREF23, MISSA and its variants outperform the TransferTransfo and the hybrid models on all evaluation metrics. Such good performance indicates MISSA can be easily applied to a different non-collaborative task and achieve good performance. Particularly, MISSA achieves the lowest perplexity, which confirms that using conditional response generation leads to high quality responses. Compared with the result on AntiScam dataset, MISSA-con performs the best in terms of RIP and ERIP. We suspect the underlying reason is that there are more possible responses with the same intent in PersuasionForGood than in AntiScam. This also suggests that we should adjust the model structure according to the nature of the dataset.\nWe propose a general dialog system pipeline to build non-collaborative dialog systems, including a hierarchical annotation scheme and an end-to-end neural response generation model called MISSA. With the hierarchical annotation scheme, we can distinguish on-task and off-task intents. MISSA takes both on and off-task intents as supervision in its training and thus can deal with diverse user utterances in non-collaborative settings. Moreover, to validate MISSA's performance, we create a non-collaborate dialog dataset that focuses on deterring phone scammers. MISSA outperforms all baseline methods in terms of fluency, coherency, and user engagement on both the newly proposed anti-scam task and an existing persuasion task. However, MISSA still produces responses that are not consistent with their distant conversation history as GPT can only track a limited history span. In future work, we plan to address this issue by developing methods that can effectively track longer dialog context.\nThis work was supported by DARPA ASED Program HR001117S0050.

The views and conclusions contained herein are those of the authors and should not be interpreted as necessarily representing the official policies, either expressed or implied, of DARPA or the U.S. Government.\nWe randomly pair two workers: one is assigned the role of the attacker to elicit user information, and the other one is assigned the role of an everyday user who aims to protect her/his information and potentially elicit the attacker's information. We give both workers specific personal data. Instructions are shown in Table TABREF24. The \u201cattacker\u201d additionally receives training on how to elicit information from people. Workers cannot see their partners' instructions.\nThere are two tasks for the users: firstly, users are required to chat with their partners and determine if they are attackers or not, reporting their decisions at the end of the task. If users think their partners are attackers, they are instructed to prolong the conversation and elicit information from their partners. We give a bonus to users if they detect the attackers and elicit real information from the attackers, including the attacker's name, address and phone number. Since one worker can only participate once in the task, they do not know their partners are always attackers.\nWe provide real user information including the user's name and the task background (user purchased a product on Amazon) . Attackers are well-trained to pretend to be an Amazon customer service agent. To simulate a real-world scam, we tell attackers some details about the user, such as the user's name to stop them from being too easily identified. We give a bonus to attackers if they elicit correct information from users, including the user's address, credit card number, CVS and expiration date. Each worker can only participate once to prevent workers from knowing their partner's information and goals in advance. We collected 220 human-human dialogs. The average conversation length is 12.45 turns and the average utterance length is 11.13 words. Only 172 out of 220 users successfully identified their partner as an attacker, suggesting that the attackers are well trained and not too easily identifiable.\nWe recruited two expert annotators who have linguistic training to annotate 3,044 sentences in 100 dialogs, achieving a 0.874 averaged weighted kappa value. Table TABREF2 shows that there is a vast amount of off-task content in the dataset, which confirms the necessity of a hierarchical on-task/off-task annotation scheme. We observe that sentences from the attacker and user have different intent distributions. Compared to attackers, users produce more refusal (74 vs 19), because users are more likely to refuse to provide requested information if they have detected the attacker. Moreover, users also ask more open_questions (173 vs 54) and yes_no_questions (165 vs 117) for off-task content because they are instructed to prolong the conversation after detecting the attacker. Furthermore, attackers and users both have a massive amount of social content (292 in total and 252 in total), suggesting that it is important to have social intent sentences to maintain the conversation.\nMISSA is based on the generative pre-trained transformer BIBREF32. We use an Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 6.25e-5 and $L2$ weight decay of $0.01$, we set the coefficient of language modeling loss to be 2, the coefficient of intent and slot classifiers to be 1, and the coefficient of next-utterance classifier to be 1. We first pre-train the model on the PERSONA-CHAT dataset. When fine-tuning on the AntiScam and the PersuasionForGood datasets, we use $80\\%$ data for training, $10\\%$ data for validation, and $10\\%$ data for testing. Since the original PersuasionForGood dataset is annotated with intents, we separate the original on-task and off-task intents, which are shown in Table TABREF2. To deal with the words out of the vocabulary, we conduct delexicalization to replace slot values with corresponding slot tokens during the training phase, and replace the slot tokens with pre-defined information during testing.\nAn example of human-human chat on AntiScam dataset is shown in Table TABREF25.", "question": "What are the evaluation metrics and criteria used to evaluate the model performance?", "expected_output": "Perplexity.

{"id": "1904.09131", "prompt": "Named Entity Linking is the task of detecting mentions of entities from a knowledge base in free text, as illustrated in Figure 1 .\nMost of the entity linking literature focuses on target knowledge bases which are derived from Wikipedia, such as DBpedia BIBREF0 or YAGO BIBREF1 . These bases are curated automatically by harvesting information from the info-boxes and categories on each Wikipedia page and are therefore not editable directly.\nWikidata BIBREF2 is an editable, multilingual knowledge base which has recently gained popularity as a target database for entity linking BIBREF3 , BIBREF4 , BIBREF5 , BIBREF6 . As these new approaches to entity linking also introduce novel learning methods, it is hard to tell apart the benefits that come from the new models and those which come from the choice of knowledge graph and the quality of its data.\nWe review the main differences between Wikidata and static knowledge bases extracted from Wikipedia, and analyze their implactions for entity linking. We illustrate these differences by building a simple entity linker, OpenTapioca, which only uses data from Wikidata, and show that it is competitive with other systems with access to larger data sources for some tasks. OpenTapioca can be trained easily from a Wikidata dump only, and can be efficiently kept up to date in real time as Wikidata evolves. We also propose tools to adapt existing entity linking datasets to Wikidata, and offer a new entity linking dataset, consisting of affiliation strings extracted from research articles.\nWikidata is a wiki itself, meaning that it can be edited by anyone, but differs from usual wikis by its data model: information about an entity can only be input as structured data, in a format that is similar to RDF.\nWikidata stores information about the world in a collection of items, which are structured wiki pages. Items are identified by ther Q-id, such as Q40469, and they are made of several data fields. The label stores the preferred name for the entity. It is supported by a description, a short phrase describing the item to disambiguate it from namesakes, and aliases are alternate names for the entity. These three fields are stored separately for each language supported by Wikidata. Items also hold a collection of statements: these are RDF-style claims which have the item as subject. They can be backed by references and be made more precise with qualifiers, which all rely on a controlled vocabulary of properties (similar to RDF predicates). Finally, items can have site links, connecting them to the corresponding page for the entity in other Wikimedia projects (such as Wikipedia). Note that Wikidata items to not need to be associated with any Wikipedia page: in fact, Wikidata's policy on the notability of the subjects it covers is much more permissive than in Wikipedia. For a more detailed introduction to Wikidata's data model we refer the reader to BIBREF2 , BIBREF7 .\nOur goal is to evaluate the usefulness of this crowdsourced structured data for entity linking. We will therefore refrain from augmenting it with any external data (such as phrases and topical information extracted from Wikipedia pages), as is generally done when working with DBpedia or YAGO. By avoiding a complex mash-up of data coming from disparate sources, our entity linking system is also simpler and easier to reproduce. Finally, it is possible keep OpenTapioca in real-time synchronization with the live version of Wikidata, with a lag of a few seconds only. This means that users are able to fix or improve the knowledge graph, for instance by adding a missing alias on an item, and immediately see the benefits on their entity linking task. This constrasts with all other systems we are aware of, where the user either cannot directly intervene on the underlying data, or there is a significant delay in propagating these updates to the entity linking system.\nWe review the dominant architecture of entity linking heuristics following BIBREF8 , and assess its applicability to Wikidata.\nEntities in the knowledge base are associated with a set (or probability distribution) of possible surface forms. Given a text to annotate, candidate entities are generated by looking for occurrences of their surface forms in the text. Because of homonymy, many of these candidate occurrences turn out to be false matches, so a classifier is used to predict their correctness. We can group the features they tend to use in the following categories:\nThese features compare the phrase to annotate with the known surface forms for the entity. Collecting such forms is often done by extracting mentions from Wikipedia BIBREF9 . Link labels, redirects, disambiguation pages and bold text in abstracts can all be useful to discover alternate names for an entity. It is also possible to crawl the web for Wikipedia links to improve the coverage, often at the expense of data quality BIBREF10 .\nBeyond collecting a set of possible surface forms, these approaches count the number of times an entity $e$ was mentioned by a phrase $w$ . This makes it possible to use a Bayesian methodology: the compatibility of a candidate entity $e$ with a given mention $w$ is $P(e | w) = \\frac{P(e,w)}{P(w)}$ , which can be estimated from the statistics collected.\nIn Wikidata, items have labels and aliases in multiple languages. As this information is directly curated by editors, these phrases tend to be of high quality. However, they do not come with occurence counts. As items link to each other using their Wikidata identifiers only, it is not possible to compare the number of times USA was used to refer United States of America (Q30) or to United States Army (Q9212) inside Wikidata.\nUnlike Wikipedia's page titles which must be unique in a given language, two Wikidata items can have the same label in the same language. For instance Curry is the English label of both the item about the Curry programming language (Q2368856) and the item about the village in Alaska (Q5195194), and the description field is used to disambiguate them.\nManual curation of surface forms implies a fairly narrow coverage, which can be an issue for general purpose entity linking. For instance, people are commonly refered to with their given or family name only, and these names are not systematically added as aliases: at the time of writing, Trump is an alias for Donald Trump (Q22686), but Cameron is not an alias for David Cameron (Q192). As a Wikidata editor, the main incentive to add aliases to an item is to make it easier to find the item with Wikidata's auto-suggest field, so that it can be edited or linked to more easily. Aliases are not designed to offer a complete set of possible surface forms found in text: for instance, adding common mispellings of a name is discouraged.\nAlthough Wikidata makes it impossible to count how often a particular label or alias is used to refer to an entity, these surface forms are carefully curated by the community. They are therefore fairly reliable.\nGiven an entity $e$ and a phrase $d[s]$ , we need to compute $p(e|\nd[s])$ . Having no access to such a probability distribution, we choose to approximate this quantity by $\\frac{p(e)}{p(d[s])}$ , where $p(e)$ is the probability that $e$ is linked to, and $p(d[s])$ is the probability that $d[s]$ occurs in a text. In other words, we estimate the popularity of the entity and the commonness of the phrase separately.\nWe estimate the popularity of an entity $e$ by a log-linear combination of its number of statements $n_e$ , site links $s_e$ and its PageRank $r(e)$ . The PageRank is computed on the entire Wikidata using statement values and qualifiers as edges.\nThe probability $p(d[s])$ is estimated by a simple unigram language model that can be trained either on any large unannotated dataset.\nThe local compatibility is therefore represented by a vector of features $F(e,w)$ and the local compatibility is computed as follows, where $\\lambda $ is a weights vector: $\nF(e,w) &= ( -\\log p(d[s]), \\log p(e) , n_e, s_e, 1 ) \\\\\np(e|d[s]) &\\propto e^{F(e,w) \\cdot \\lambda }\n$ \nThe compatibility of the topic of a candidate entity with the rest of the document is traditionally estimated by similarity measures from information retrieval such as TFIDF BIBREF11 , BIBREF12 or keyword extraction BIBREF13 , BIBREF14 , BIBREF9 .\nWikidata items only consist of structured data, except in their descriptions. This makes it difficult to compute topical information using the methods above. Vector-based representations of entities can be extracted from the knowledge graph alone BIBREF15 , BIBREF16 , but it is not clear how to compare them to topic representations for plain text, which would be computed differently. In more recent work, neural word embeddings were used to represent topical information for both text and entities BIBREF17 , BIBREF6 , BIBREF18 . This requires access to large amounts of text both to train the word vectors and to derive the entity vectors from them. These vectors have been shown to encode significant semantic information by themselves BIBREF19 , so we refrain from using them in this study.\nEntities mentioned in the same context are often topically related, therefore it is useful not to treat linking decisions in isolation but rather to try to maximize topical coherence in the chosen items. This is the issue on which entity linking systems differ the most as it is harder to model.\nFirst, we need to estimate the topical coherence of a sequence of linking decisions. This is often done by first defining a pairwise relatedness score between the target entities. For instance, a popular metric introduced by BIBREF20 considers the set of wiki links $|a|, |b|$ made from or to two entities $a$ , $b$ and computes their relatedness: $ \\text{rel}(a,b) = 1 - \\frac{\\log (\\max (|a|,|b|)) - \\log (|a| \\cap |b|)}{\\log (|K|) - \\log (\\min (|a|,|b|))}$ \nwhere $|K|$ is the number of entities in the knowledge base.\nWhen linking to Wikidata instead of Wikipedia, it is tempting to reuse these heuristics, replacing wikilinks by statements. However, Wikidata's linking structure is quite different from Wikipedia: statements are generally a lot sparser than links and they have a precise semantic meaning, as editors are restricted by the available properties when creating new statements. We propose in the next section a similarity measure that we find to perform well experimentally.\nOnce a notion of semantic similarity is chosen, we need to integrate it in the inference process. Most approaches build a graph of candidate entities, where edges indicate semantic relatedness: the difference between the heuristics lie in the way this graph is used for the matching decisions. BIBREF21 use an approximate algorithm to find the densest subgraph of the semantic graph. This determines choices of entities for each mention. In other approaches, the initial evidence given by the local compatibility score is propagated along the edges of the semantic graph BIBREF14 , BIBREF22 or aggregated at a global level with a Conditional Random Field BIBREF17 .\nWe propose a model that adapts previous approaches to Wikidata. Let $d$ be a document (a piece of text). A spot $s \\in d$ is a pair of start and end positions in $d$ . It defines a phrase $d[s]$ , and a set of candidate entities $E[s]$ : those are all Wikidata items for which $d[s]$ is a label or alias. Given two spots $s, s^{\\prime }$ we denote by $|s - s^{\\prime }|$ the number of characters between them. We build a binary classifier which predicts for each $s \\in d$ and $e \\in E[s]$ if $s \\in d$0 should be linked to $s \\in d$1 .\nThe issue with the features above is that they ignore the context in which a mention in found. To make it context-sensitive, we adapt the approach of BIBREF22 to our setup. The general idea is to define a graph on the candidate entities, linking candidate entities which are semantically related, and then find a combination of candidate entities which have both high local compatibility and which are densely related in the graph.\nFor each pair of entities $e, e^{\\prime }$ we define a similarity metric $s(e,e^{\\prime })$ . Let $l(e)$ be the set of items that $e$ links to in its statements. Consider a one-step random walks starting on $e$ , with probability $\\beta $ to stay on $e$ and probability $\\frac{1-\\beta }{|l(e)|}$ to reach one of the linked items. We define $s(e,e^{\\prime })$ as the probability that two such one-step random walks starting from $e$ and $s(e,e^{\\prime })$0 end up on the same item. This can be computed explicitly as $s(e,e^{\\prime })$1 \nWe then build a weighted graph $G_d$ whose vertices are pairs $(s \\in d, e \\in E[s])$ . In other words, we add a vertex for each candidate entity at a given spot. We fix a maximum distance $D$ for edges: vertices $(s,e)$ and $(s^{\\prime },e^{\\prime })$ can only be linked if $|s - s^{\\prime }| \\le D$ and $s \\ne s^{\\prime }$ . In this case, we define the weight of such an edge as $(\\eta + s(e,e^{\\prime }))\\frac{D - |s - s^{\\prime }|}{D}$ , where $\\eta $ is a smoothing parameter. In other words, the edge weight is proportional to the smoothed similarity between the entities, discounted by the distance between the mentions.\nThe weighted graph $G_d$ can be represented as an adjacency matrix. We transform it into a column-stochastic matrix $M_d$ by normalizing its columns to sum to one. This defines a Markov chain on the candidate entities, that we will use to propagate the local evidence.\n BIBREF22 first combine the local features into a local evidence score, and then spread this local evidence using the Markov chain: \n$$ \nG(d) = (\\alpha I + (1 - \\alpha ) M_d)^k \\cdot LC(d)$$   (Eq. 14) \n We propose a variant of this approach, where each individual local compatibility feature is propagated independently along the Markov chain. Let $F$ be the matrix of all local features for each candidate entity: $F = (F(e_1,d[s_1]),\n\\dots , F(e_n, d[s_n]))$ . After $k$ iterations in the Markov chain, this defines features $M_d^k F$ . Rather than relying on these features for a fixed number of steps $k$ , we record the features at each step, which defines the vector $(F, M_d \\cdot F, M_d^2 \\cdot F, \\dots , M_d^k \\cdot F)$ \nThis alleviates the need for an $\\alpha $ parameter while keeping the number of features small. We train a linear support vector classifier on these features and this defines the final score of each candidate entity. For each spot, our system picks the highest-scoring candidate entity that the classifier predicts as a match, if any.\nMost entity linking datasets are annotated against DBpedia or YAGO. Wikidata contains items which do not have any corresponding Wikipedia article (in any language), so these items do not have any DBpedia or YAGO URI either. Therefore, converting an entity linking dataset from DBpedia to Wikidata requires more effort than simply following owl:sameAs links: we also need to annotate mentions of Wikidata items which do not have a corresponding DBpedia URI.\nWe used the RSS-500 dataset of news excerpts annotated against DBpedia and encoded in NIF format BIBREF23 . We first translated all DBpedia URIs to Wikidata items. Then, we used OpenRefine BIBREF24 to extract the entities marked not covered by DBpedia and matched them against Wikidata. After human review, this added 63 new links to the 524 converted from DBpedia (out of 476 out-of-KB entities).\nWe also annotated a new dataset from scratch. The ISTEX dataset consists of one thousand author affiliation strings extracted from research articles and exposed by the ISTEX text and data mining service. In this dataset, only 64 of the 2,624 Wikidata mentions do not have a corresponding DBpedia URI.\nWe use the Wikidata JSON dump of 2018-02-24 for our experiments, indexed with Solr (Lucene). We restrict the index to humans, organizations and locations, by selecting only items whose type was a subclass of (P279) human (Q5), organization (Q43229) or geographical object (Q618123). Labels and aliases in all languages are added to a case-sensitive FST index.\nWe trained our classifier and its hyper-parameters by five-fold cross-validation on the training sets of the ISTEX and RSS datasets. We used GERBIL BIBREF23 to evaluate OpenTapioca against other approaches. We report the InKB micro and macro F1 scores on test sets, with GERBIL's weak annotation match method.\nThe surface forms curated by Wikidata editors are sufficient to reach honourable recall, without the need to expand them with mentions extracted from Wikipedia. Our restriction to people, locations and organizations probably helps in this regard and we anticipate worse performance for broader domains. Our approach works best for scientific affiliations, where spelling is more canonical than in newswire. The availability of Twitter identifiers directly in Wikidata helps us to reach acceptable performance in this domain. The accuracy degrades on longer texts which require relying more on the ambiant topical context. In future work, we would like to explore the use of entity embeddings to improve our approach in this regard.", "question": "What is the accuracy of this model compared to sota?", "expected_output": "The model improves the state of the art performance for the ISTEX dataset (F1 micro: 0.870, F1 macro: 0.858) and for the Microposts 2016 dataset (F1 micro:  0.087)..

{"id": "1611.06322", "prompt": "Social Media has evolved from friendship based networks to become a major source for the consumption of news (NIST, 2008). On social media, news is decentralised as it provides everyone the means to efficiently report and spread information. In contrast to traditional news wire, information on social media is spread without intensive investigation, fact and background checking. The combination of ease and fast pace of sharing information provides a fertile breeding ground for rumours, false- and disinformation. Social media users tend to share controversial information in-order to verify it, while asking about for the opinions of their followers (Zhao et. al, 2015). This further amplifies the pace of a rumour's spread and reach. Rumours and deliberate disinformation have already caused panic and influenced public opinion.\nThe cases in Germany and Austria in 2016, show how misleading and false information about crimes committed by refugees negatively influenced the opinion of citizens.\nDetecting these rumours allows debunking them to prevent them from further spreading and causing harm. The further a rumour has spread, the more likely it is to be debunked by users or traditional media (Liu et. al, 2015). However, by then rumours might have already caused harm. This highlights the importance and necessity of recognizing rumours as early as possible - preferably instantaneously.\nRumour detection on social media is challenging due to the short texts, creative lexical variations and high volume of the streams. The task becomes even harder if we attempt to perform rumour detection on-the-fly, without looking into the future. We provide an effective and highly scalable approach to detect rumours instantly after they were posted with zero delay. We introduce a new features category called novelty based features. Novelty based features compensate the absence of repeated information by consulting additional data sources - news wire articles. We hypothesize that information not confirmed by official news is an indication of rumours. Additionally we introduce pseudo feedback for classification. In a nutshell, documents that are similar to previously detected rumours are considered to be more likely to also be a rumour. The proposed features can be computed in constant time and space allowing us to process high-volume streams in real-time (Muthukrishnan, 2005). Our experiments reveal that novelty based features and pseudo feedback significantly increases detection performance for early rumour detection.\nThe contributions of this paper include:\nNovelty based Features\nWe introduced a new category of features for instant rumour detection that harnesses trusted resources. Unconfirmed (novel) information with respect to trusted resources is considered as an indication of rumours.\nPseudo Feedback for Detection/Classification\nPseudo feedback increases detection accuracy by harnessing repeated signals, without the need of retrospective operation.\nBefore rumour detection, scientists already studied the related problem of information credibility evaluation (Castillo et. al. 2011; Richardson et. al, 2003). Recently, automated rumour detection on social media evolved into a popular research field which also relies on assessing the credibility of messages and their sources. The most successful methods proposed focus on classification harnessing lexical, user-centric, propagation-based (Wu et. al, 2015) and cluster-based (Cai et. al, 2014; Liu et. al, 2015; Zhao et. al, 2015) features.\nMany of these context based features originate from a study by Castillo et. al (2011), which pioneered in engineering features for credibility assessment on Twitter (Liu et. al, 2015). They observed a significant correlation between the trustworthiness of a tweet with context-based characteristics including hashtags, punctuation characters and sentiment polarity. When assessing the credibility of a tweet, they also assessed the source of its information by constructing features based on provided URLs as well as user based features like the activeness of the user and social graph based features like the frequency of re-tweets. A comprehensive study by Castillo et. al (2011) of information credibility assessment widely influenced recent research on rumour detection, whose main focuses lies upon improving detection quality.\nWhile studying the trustworthiness of tweets during crises, Mendoza et. al (2010) found that the topology of a distrustful tweet's propagation pattern differs from those of news and normal tweets. These findings along with the fact that rumours tend to more likely be questioned by responses than news paved the way for future research examining propagation graphs and clustering methods (Cai et. al, 2014; Zhao et. al, 2015). The majority of current research focuses on improving the accuracy of classifiers through new features based on clustering (Cai et. al, 2014; Zhao et. al, 2015), sentiment analysis (Qazvinian et. al, 2011; Wu et. al, 2015) as well as propagation graphs (Kwon, et. al, 2013; Wang et. al, 2015).\nRecent research mainly focuses on further improving the quality of rumour detection while neglecting the increasing delay between the publication and detection of a rumour. The motivation for rumour detection lies in debunking them to prevent them from spreading and causing harm. Unfortunately, state-of-the-art systems operate in a retrospective manner, meaning they detect rumours long after they have spread. The most accurate systems rely on features based on propagation graphs and clustering techniques. These features can only detect rumours after the rumours have spread and already caused harm.\nTherefore, researchers like Liu et. al (2015), Wu et. al (2015), Zhao et. al (2015) and Zhou et. al (2015) focus on 'early rumour-detection' while allowing a delay up to 24 hours. Their focus on latency aware rumour detection makes their approaches conceptually related to ours. Zhao et. al (1015) found clustering tweets containing enquiry patterns as an indication of rumours. Also clustering tweets by keywords and subsequently judging rumours using an ensemble model that combine user, propagation and content-based features proved to be effective (Zhou et. al, 2015). Although the computation of their features is efficient, the need for repeated mentions in the form of response by other users results in increased latency between publication and detection. The approach with the lowest latency banks on the 'wisdom of the crowd' (Liu et. al, 2015). In addition to traditional context and user based features they also rely on clustering micro-blogs by their topicality to identify conflicting claims, which indicate increased likelihood of rumours. Although they claim to operate in real-time, they require a cluster of at least 5 messages to detect a rumour.\nIn contrast, we introduce new features to detect rumours as early as possible - preferably instantly, allowing them to be debunked before they spread and cause harm.\nRumour detection is a challenging task, as it requires determining the truth of information (Zhao et. al, 2015). The Cambridge dictionary, defines a rumour as information of doubtful or unconfirmed truth. We rely on classification using an SVM, which is the state-of-the-art approach for novelty detection. Numerous features have been proposed for rumour detection on social media, many of which originate from an original study on information credibility by Castillo et. al (2011). Unfortunately, the currently most successful features rely on information based on graph propagation and clustering, which can only be computed retrospectively. This renders them close to useless when detecting rumours early on. We introduce two new classes of features, one based on novelty, the other on pseudo feedback. Both feature categories improve detection accuracy early on, when information is limited.\nWe frame the Real-time Rumour Detection task as a classification problem that assesses a document's likelihood of becoming a future rumour at the time of its publication. Consequently, prediction takes place in real-time with a single pass over the data.\nMore formally, we denote by $d_t$ the document that arrives from stream $S:\\lbrace d_0, d_1, . . . d_n\\rbrace $ at time $t$ . Upon arrival of document $d_t$ we compute its corresponding feature vector $f_{d,t}$ . Given $f_{d,t}$ and the previously obtained weigh vector $w$ we compute the rumour score $RS_{d,t} = w^T \\times f_{d,t}$ . The rumour prediction is based on a fixed thresholding strategy with respect to $\\theta $ . We predict that message $d_t$ is likely to become a rumour if its rumour score exceeds the detection threshold $S:\\lbrace d_0, d_1, . . . d_n\\rbrace $0 . The optimal parameter setting for weight vector $S:\\lbrace d_0, d_1, . . . d_n\\rbrace $1 and detection threshold $S:\\lbrace d_0, d_1, . . . d_n\\rbrace $2 are learned on a test to maximise prediction accuracy.\nTo increase instantaneous detection performance, we compensate for the absence of future information by consulting additional data sources. In particular, we make use of news wire articles, which are considered to be of high credibility. This is reasonable as according to Petrovic et. al (2013), in the majority of cases, news wires lead social media for reporting news. When a message arrives from a social media stream, we build features based on its novelty with respect to the confirmed information in the trusted sources. In a nutshell, the presence of information unconfirmed by the official media is construed as an indication of being a rumour. Note that this closely resembles the definition of what a rumour is.\nHigh volume streams demand highly efficient feature computation. This applies in particular to novelty based features since they can be computationally expensive. We explore two approaches to novelty computation: one based on vector proximity, the other on kterm hashing.\nComputing novelty based on traditional vector proximity alone does not yield adequate performance due to the length discrepancy between news wire articles and social media messages. To make vector proximity applicable, we slide a term-level based window, whose length resembles the average social media message length, through each of the news articles. This results in sub-documents whose length resembles those of social media messages. Novelty is computed using term weighted tf-idf dot products between the social media message and all news sub-documents. The inverse of the minimum similarity to the nearest neighbour equates to the degree of novelty.\nThe second approach to compute novelty relies on kterm hashing (Wurzer et. al, 2015), a recent advance in novelty detection that improved the efficiency by an order of magnitude without sacrificing effectiveness. Kterm hashing computes novelty non-comparatively. Instead of measuring similarity between documents, a single representation of previously seen information is constructed. For each document, all possible kterms are formed and hashed onto a Bloom Filter. Novelty is computed by the fraction of unseen kterms. Kterm hashing has the interesting characteristic of forming a collective 'memory', able to span all trusted resources. We exhaustively form kterm for all news articles and store their corresponding hash positions in a Bloom Filter. This filter then captures the combined information of all trusted resources. A single representation allows computing novelty with a single step, instead of comparing each social media message individually with all trusted resources.\nWhen kterm hashing was introduced by Wurzer et. al (2015) for novelty detection on English tweets, they weighted all kterm uniformly. We found that treating all kterms as equally important, does not unlock the full potential of kterm hashing. Therefore, we additionally extract the top 10 keywords ranked by $tf.idf$ and build a separate set of kterms solely based on them. This allows us to compute a dedicated weight for kterms based on these top 10 keywords. The distinction in weights between kterms based on all versus keyword yields superior rumour detection quality, as described in section \"Feature analysis\" . This leaves us with a total of 6 novelty based features for kterm hashing - kterms of length 1 to 3 for all words and keywords.\nApart from novelty based features, we also apply a range of 51 context based features. The full list of features can be found in table 6 . The focus lies on features that can be computed instantly based only on the text of a message to keep the latency of our approach to a minimum. Most of these 51 features overlap with previous studies (Castillo et. al, 2011; Liu et. al, 2015; Qazvinian et. al, 2011; Yang et. al, 2012; Zhao et. al, 2015). This includes features based on the presence or number of URLs, hash-tags and user-names, POS tags, punctuation characters as well as 8 different categories of sentiment and emotions.\nOn the arrival of a new message from a stream, all its features are computed and linearly combined using weights obtained from an SVM classifier, yielding the rumour score. We then judge rumours based on an optimal threshold strategy for the rumour score.\nIn addition to novelty based features we introduce another category of features - dubbed Pseudo-Feedback (PF) feature - to boost detection performance. The feature is conceptually related to pseudo relevance feedback found in retrieval and ranking tasks in IR. The concept builds upon the idea that documents, which reveal similar characteristics as previously detected rumours are also likely to be a rumour. During detection, feedback about which of the previous documents describes a rumour is not available. Therefore, we rely on 'pseudo' feedback and consider all documents whose rumour score exceeds a threshold as true rumours.\nThe PF feature describes the maximum similarity between a new document and those documents previously considered as rumour. Similarities are measured by vector proximity in term space. Conceptually, PF passes on evidence to repeated signals by increasing the rumour score of future documents if they are similar to a recently detected rumour. Note that this allows harnessing information from repeated signals without the need of operating retrospectively.\nTraining Pseudo Feedback Features\nThe trainings routine differs from the standard procedure, because the computation of the PF feature requires two training rounds as we require a model of all other features to identify 'pseudo' rumours. In a first training round a SVM is used to compute weights for all features in the trainings set, except the PF features. This provides a model for all but the PF features. Then the trainings set is processed to computing rumour scores based on the model obtained from our initial trainings round. This time, we additionally compute the PF feature value by measuring the minimum distance in term space between the current document vector and those previous documents, whose rumour score exceeds a previously defined threshold. Since we operate on a stream, the number of documents previously considered as rumours grows without bound. To keep operation constant in time and space, we only compare against the k most recent documents considered to be rumours. Once we obtained the value for the PF feature, we compute its weight using the SVM. The combination of the weight for the PF feature with the weights for all other features, obtained in the initial trainings round, resembles the final model.\nThe previous sections introduced two new categories of features for rumour detection. Now we test their performance and impact on detection effectiveness and efficiency. In a streaming setting, documents arrive on a continual basis one at a time. We require our features to compute a rumour-score instantaneously for each document in a single-pass over the data. Messages with high rumour scores are considered likely being rumours. The classification decision is based on an optimal thresholding strategy based on the trainings set.\nWe report accuracy to evaluate effectiveness, as is usual in the literature (Zhou et. al, 2015). Additionally we use the standard TDT evaluation procedure (Allan et. al, 2000; NIST, 2008) with the official TDT3 evaluation scripts (NIST, 2008) using standard settings. This procedure evaluates detection tasks using Detection Error Trade-off (DET) curves, which show the trade-off between miss and false alarm probability. By visualizing the full range of thresholds, DET plots provide a more comprehensive illustration of effectiveness than single value metrics (Allan et. al, 2000). We also evaluate the efficiency of computing the proposed features, measured by the throughput per second, when applied to a high number of messages.\nRumour detection on social media is a novel research field without official data sets. Since licences agreements forbid redistribution of data, no data sets from previous publications are available. We therefore followed previous researchers like Liu et. al (2015) and Yang et. al (2012) and created our own dataset.\ntrusted resources: We randomly collected 200 news articles about broad topics commonly reported by news wires over our target time period. These range from news about celebrities and disasters to financial and political affairs as seen in table 1 . Since we operate on Chinese social media, we gathered news articles from Xinhua News Agency, the leading news-wire in China. To ensure a fair evaluation, we collected the news articles before judging rumours, not knowing which rumours we would find later on. We also only consider news articles published before the timestamps of the social media messages.\nFor our social media stream, we chose Sina Weibo, a Chinese social media service with more than 200 million active users. Micro-blogs from Sina Weibo are denoted as 'weibos'.\nrumours: Sina Weibo offers an official rumour debunking service, operated by trained human professionals. Following Yang et. al (2012) and Zhou et. al (2015), we use this service to obtain a high quality set of 202 confirmed rumours.\nnon-rumours: We additionally gathered 202 non-rumours using the public Sina Weibo API. Three human annotators judged these weibos based on unanimous decision making to ensure that they don't contain rumours.\nSince we operate in a streaming environment, all weibos are sorted based on their publication time-stamp. Table 3 shows a list of example for rumours found in our data set.\nWe ordered the rumours and non-rumours chronologically and divided them in half, forming a training and test set. We ensured that each of the sets consists of 50% rumours and non-rumours. This is important when effectiveness is measured by accuracy. All training and optimization use the trainings set. Performance is then reported based on a single run on the test set.\nTo evaluate our new features for rumour detection, we compare them with two state-of-the-art early rumour detection baselines Liu et. al (2015) and Yang et. al (2012), which we re-implemented. We chose the algorithm by Yang et. al (2012), dubbed Yang, because they proposed a feature set for early detection tailored to Sina Weibo and were used as a state-of-the-art baseline before by Liu et. al (2015). The algorithm by Liu et. al (2015), dubbed Liu, is said to operate in real-time and outperformed Yang, when only considering features available on Twitter. Both apply various message-, user-, topic- and propagation-based features and rely on an SVM classifier which they also found to perform best. The approaches advertise themselves as suitable for early or real-time detection and performed rumour detection with the smallest latency across all published methods. Yang performs early rumour detection and operates with a delay of 24 hours. Liu is claimed to perform in real-time while, requiring a cluster of 5 repeated messages to judge them for rumours. Note that although these algorithm are state-of-the-art for detecting rumours as quickly as possible, they still require a certain delay to reach their full potential.\nTable 2 compares the performance of our features with the two classifiers on the 101 rumours and 101 non-rumours of the test set, when detecting rumour instantly after their publication. The table reveals comparable accuracy for Yang and Liu at around 60%. Our observed performance of Yang matches those by Liu et. al (2015). Surprisingly, the algorithm Liu does not perform significantly better than Yang when applied to instantaneous rumour detection although they claimed to operate in real-time. Liu et. al (2015) report performance based on the first 5 messages which clearly outperforms Yang for early rumour detection. However, we find that when reducing the set from 5 to 1, their superiority is only marginal. In contrast, the combination of novelty and pseudo relevance based features performs significantly better (sign test with $p < 0.05$ ) than the baselines for instantaneous rumour detections. Novelty based features benefit from news articles as an external data source, which explains their superior performance. In particular for instantaneous rumour detection, where information can only be obtained from a single message, the use of external data proves to perform superior. Note that accuracy is a single value metric describing performance at an optimal threshold. Figure 1 compares the effectiveness of the three algorithms for the full range of rumour scores for instantaneous detection. Different applications require a different balance between miss and false alarm. But the DET curve shows that Liu\u2019s method would be preferable over Yang for any application. Similarly, the plot reveals that our approach dominates both baselines throughout all threshold settings and for the high-recall region in particular.\nWhen increasing the detection delay to 12 and 24 hours, all three algorithms reach comparable performance with no statistically significant difference, as seen in table 4. For our approach, none of the features are computed retrospectively, which explains why the performance does not change when increasing the detection delay. The additional time allows Liu and Yang to collect repeated signals, which improves their detection accuracy. After 24 hours Liu performs the highest due to its retrospectively computed features. Note that after 24 hours rumours might have already spread far through social networks and potentially caused harm.\nWe group our 57 features into 7 categories shown in Table 6 and analyse their contribution using feature ablation, as seen in Table 5 . Feature ablation illustrates the importance of a feature by measuring performance, when removing it from the set of features. Novelty related features based on kterm hashing were found to be dominant for instantaneous rumour detection $(p < 0.05)$ . 'Sentence char' features, which include punctuation, hashtags, user-symbols and URLs, contributed the most of the traditional features, followed by Part of Speech ('POS') and 'extreme word' features. Our experiments found 'sentiment' and 'emotion' based features to contribute the least. Since excluding them both results in a considerable drop of performance we conclude that they capture comparable information and therefore compensated for each other.\nNovelty based Features\nNovelty based features revealed the highest impact on detection performance. In particular kterms formed from the top keywords contribute the most. This is interesting, as when kterm hashing was introduced (Wurzer et. al, 2015), all kterms were considered as equally important. We found that prioritising certain kterms yields increased performance.\nInterestingly, novelty based features computed by the vector similarity between weibos and news sub-documents perform slightly worse (-2% absolute). When striping all but the top tf-idf weighted terms from the news sub-documents, the hit in performance can be reduced to -1 % absolute. Kterm constructs a combined memory of all information presented to it. Pulling all information into a single representation bridges the gab between documents and allows finding information matches within documents. We hypothesize that this causes increased detection performance.\nPseudo Feedbaack\nFeatures ablation revealed that pseudo feedback (PF) increased detection performance by 5.3% (relative). PF builds upon the output of the other features. High performance of the other features results in higher positive impact of PF. We want to further explore the behaviour of PF when other features perform badly in future studies.\nPrevious approaches to rumour detection rely on repeated signals to form propagation graphs or clustering methods. Beside causing a detection delay these methods are also blind to less popular rumours that don't go viral. In contrast, novelty based feature require only a single message enabling them to detect even the smallest rumours. Examples for such small rumours are shown in table 3 .\nTo demonstrate the high efficiency of computing novelty and pseudo feedback features, we implement a rumour detection system and measure its throughput when applied to 100k weibos. We implement our system in C and run it using a single core on a 2.2GHz Intel Core i7-4702HQ. We measure the throughput on an idle machine and average the observed performance over 5 runs. Figure 2 presents performance when processing more and more weibos. The average throughput of our system is around 7,000 weibos per second, which clearly exceeds the average volume of the full Twitter (5,700 tweets/sec.) and Sina Weibo (1,200 weibos/sec.) stream. Since the number of news articles is relatively small, we find no difference in terms of efficiency between computing novelty features based on kterm hashing and vector similarity. Figure 2 also illustrates that our proposed features can be computed in constant time with respect to the number of messages processed. This is crucial to keep operation in a true streaming environment feasible. Approaches, whose runtime depend on the number of documents processed become progressively slower, which is inapplicable when operating on data streams. Our experiments show that the proposed features perform effectively and their efficiency allows them to detect rumours instantly after their publication.\nWe introduced two new categories of features which significantly improve instantaneous rumour detection performance. Novelty based features consider the increased presence of unconfirmed information within a message with respect to trusted sources as an indication of being a rumour. Pseudo feedback features consider messages that are similar to previously detected rumours as more likely to also be a rumour. Pseudo feedback and its variant, recursive pseudo feedback, allow harnessing repeated signals without the need of operating retrospectively. Our evaluation showed that novelty and pseudo feedback based features perform significantly more effective than other real-time and early detection baselines, when detecting rumours instantly after their publication. This advantage vanishes when allowing an increased detection delay.

{"id": "1611.06322", "prompt": "Social Media has evolved from friendship based networks to become a major source for the consumption of news (NIST, 2008). On social media, news is decentralised as it provides everyone the means to efficiently report and spread information. In contrast to traditional news wire, information on social media is spread without intensive investigation, fact and background checking. The combination of ease and fast pace of sharing information provides a fertile breeding ground for rumours, false- and disinformation. Social media users tend to share controversial information in-order to verify it, while asking about for the opinions of their followers (Zhao et. al, 2015). This further amplifies the pace of a rumour's spread and reach. Rumours and deliberate disinformation have already caused panic and influenced public opinion.\nThe cases in Germany and Austria in 2016, show how misleading and false information about crimes committed by refugees negatively influenced the opinion of citizens.\nDetecting these rumours allows debunking them to prevent them from further spreading and causing harm. The further a rumour has spread, the more likely it is to be debunked by users or traditional media (Liu et. al, 2015). However, by then rumours might have already caused harm. This highlights the importance and necessity of recognizing rumours as early as possible - preferably instantaneously.\nRumour detection on social media is challenging due to the short texts, creative lexical variations and high volume of the streams. The task becomes even harder if we attempt to perform rumour detection on-the-fly, without looking into the future. We provide an effective and highly scalable approach to detect rumours instantly after they were posted with zero delay. We introduce a new features category called novelty based features. Novelty based features compensate the absence of repeated information by consulting additional data sources - news wire articles. We hypothesize that information not confirmed by official news is an indication of rumours. Additionally we introduce pseudo feedback for classification. In a nutshell, documents that are similar to previously detected rumours are considered to be more likely to also be a rumour. The proposed features can be computed in constant time and space allowing us to process high-volume streams in real-time (Muthukrishnan, 2005). Our experiments reveal that novelty based features and pseudo feedback significantly increases detection performance for early rumour detection.\nThe contributions of this paper include:\nNovelty based Features\nWe introduced a new category of features for instant rumour detection that harnesses trusted resources. Unconfirmed (novel) information with respect to trusted resources is considered as an indication of rumours.\nPseudo Feedback for Detection/Classification\nPseudo feedback increases detection accuracy by harnessing repeated signals, without the need of retrospective operation.\nBefore rumour detection, scientists already studied the related problem of information credibility evaluation (Castillo et. al. 2011; Richardson et. al, 2003). Recently, automated rumour detection on social media evolved into a popular research field which also relies on assessing the credibility of messages and their sources. The most successful methods proposed focus on classification harnessing lexical, user-centric, propagation-based (Wu et. al, 2015) and cluster-based (Cai et. al, 2014; Liu et. al, 2015; Zhao et. al, 2015) features.\nMany of these context based features originate from a study by Castillo et. al (2011), which pioneered in engineering features for credibility assessment on Twitter (Liu et. al, 2015). They observed a significant correlation between the trustworthiness of a tweet with context-based characteristics including hashtags, punctuation characters and sentiment polarity. When assessing the credibility of a tweet, they also assessed the source of its information by constructing features based on provided URLs as well as user based features like the activeness of the user and social graph based features like the frequency of re-tweets. A comprehensive study by Castillo et. al (2011) of information credibility assessment widely influenced recent research on rumour detection, whose main focuses lies upon improving detection quality.\nWhile studying the trustworthiness of tweets during crises, Mendoza et. al (2010) found that the topology of a distrustful tweet's propagation pattern differs from those of news and normal tweets. These findings along with the fact that rumours tend to more likely be questioned by responses than news paved the way for future research examining propagation graphs and clustering methods (Cai et. al, 2014; Zhao et. al, 2015). The majority of current research focuses on improving the accuracy of classifiers through new features based on clustering (Cai et. al, 2014; Zhao et. al, 2015), sentiment analysis (Qazvinian et. al, 2011; Wu et. al, 2015) as well as propagation graphs (Kwon, et. al, 2013; Wang et. al, 2015).\nRecent research mainly focuses on further improving the quality of rumour detection while neglecting the increasing delay between the publication and detection of a rumour. The motivation for rumour detection lies in debunking them to prevent them from spreading and causing harm. Unfortunately, state-of-the-art systems operate in a retrospective manner, meaning they detect rumours long after they have spread. The most accurate systems rely on features based on propagation graphs and clustering techniques. These features can only detect rumours after the rumours have spread and already caused harm.\nTherefore, researchers like Liu et. al (2015), Wu et. al (2015), Zhao et. al (2015) and Zhou et. al (2015) focus on 'early rumour-detection' while allowing a delay up to 24 hours. Their focus on latency aware rumour detection makes their approaches conceptually related to ours. Zhao et. al (1015) found clustering tweets containing enquiry patterns as an indication of rumours. Also clustering tweets by keywords and subsequently judging rumours using an ensemble model that combine user, propagation and content-based features proved to be effective (Zhou et. al, 2015). Although the computation of their features is efficient, the need for repeated mentions in the form of response by other users results in increased latency between publication and detection. The approach with the lowest latency banks on the 'wisdom of the crowd' (Liu et. al, 2015). In addition to traditional context and user based features they also rely on clustering micro-blogs by their topicality to identify conflicting claims, which indicate increased likelihood of rumours. Although they claim to operate in real-time, they require a cluster of at least 5 messages to detect a rumour.\nIn contrast, we introduce new features to detect rumours as early as possible - preferably instantly, allowing them to be debunked before they spread and cause harm.\nRumour detection is a challenging task, as it requires determining the truth of information (Zhao et. al, 2015). The Cambridge dictionary, defines a rumour as information of doubtful or unconfirmed truth. We rely on classification using an SVM, which is the state-of-the-art approach for novelty detection. Numerous features have been proposed for rumour detection on social media, many of which originate from an original study on information credibility by Castillo et. al (2011). Unfortunately, the currently most successful features rely on information based on graph propagation and clustering, which can only be computed retrospectively. This renders them close to useless when detecting rumours early on. We introduce two new classes of features, one based on novelty, the other on pseudo feedback. Both feature categories improve detection accuracy early on, when information is limited.\nWe frame the Real-time Rumour Detection task as a classification problem that assesses a document's likelihood of becoming a future rumour at the time of its publication. Consequently, prediction takes place in real-time with a single pass over the data.\nMore formally, we denote by $d_t$ the document that arrives from stream $S:\\lbrace d_0, d_1, . . . d_n\\rbrace $ at time $t$ . Upon arrival of document $d_t$ we compute its corresponding feature vector $f_{d,t}$ . Given $f_{d,t}$ and the previously obtained weigh vector $w$ we compute the rumour score $RS_{d,t} = w^T \\times f_{d,t}$ . The rumour prediction is based on a fixed thresholding strategy with respect to $\\theta $ . We predict that message $d_t$ is likely to become a rumour if its rumour score exceeds the detection threshold $S:\\lbrace d_0, d_1, . . . d_n\\rbrace $0 . The optimal parameter setting for weight vector $S:\\lbrace d_0, d_1, . . . d_n\\rbrace $1 and detection threshold $S:\\lbrace d_0, d_1, . . . d_n\\rbrace $2 are learned on a test to maximise prediction accuracy.\nTo increase instantaneous detection performance, we compensate for the absence of future information by consulting additional data sources. In particular, we make use of news wire articles, which are considered to be of high credibility. This is reasonable as according to Petrovic et. al (2013), in the majority of cases, news wires lead social media for reporting news. When a message arrives from a social media stream, we build features based on its novelty with respect to the confirmed information in the trusted sources. In a nutshell, the presence of information unconfirmed by the official media is construed as an indication of being a rumour. Note that this closely resembles the definition of what a rumour is.\nHigh volume streams demand highly efficient feature computation. This applies in particular to novelty based features since they can be computationally expensive. We explore two approaches to novelty computation: one based on vector proximity, the other on kterm hashing.\nComputing novelty based on traditional vector proximity alone does not yield adequate performance due to the length discrepancy between news wire articles and social media messages. To make vector proximity applicable, we slide a term-level based window, whose length resembles the average social media message length, through each of the news articles. This results in sub-documents whose length resembles those of social media messages. Novelty is computed using term weighted tf-idf dot products between the social media message and all news sub-documents. The inverse of the minimum similarity to the nearest neighbour equates to the degree of novelty.\nThe second approach to compute novelty relies on kterm hashing (Wurzer et. al, 2015), a recent advance in novelty detection that improved the efficiency by an order of magnitude without sacrificing effectiveness. Kterm hashing computes novelty non-comparatively. Instead of measuring similarity between documents, a single representation of previously seen information is constructed. For each document, all possible kterms are formed and hashed onto a Bloom Filter. Novelty is computed by the fraction of unseen kterms. Kterm hashing has the interesting characteristic of forming a collective 'memory', able to span all trusted resources. We exhaustively form kterm for all news articles and store their corresponding hash positions in a Bloom Filter. This filter then captures the combined information of all trusted resources. A single representation allows computing novelty with a single step, instead of comparing each social media message individually with all trusted resources.\nWhen kterm hashing was introduced by Wurzer et. al (2015) for novelty detection on English tweets, they weighted all kterm uniformly. We found that treating all kterms as equally important, does not unlock the full potential of kterm hashing. Therefore, we additionally extract the top 10 keywords ranked by $tf.idf$ and build a separate set of kterms solely based on them. This allows us to compute a dedicated weight for kterms based on these top 10 keywords. The distinction in weights between kterms based on all versus keyword yields superior rumour detection quality, as described in section \"Feature analysis\" . This leaves us with a total of 6 novelty based features for kterm hashing - kterms of length 1 to 3 for all words and keywords.\nApart from novelty based features, we also apply a range of 51 context based features. The full list of features can be found in table 6 . The focus lies on features that can be computed instantly based only on the text of a message to keep the latency of our approach to a minimum. Most of these 51 features overlap with previous studies (Castillo et. al, 2011; Liu et. al, 2015; Qazvinian et. al, 2011; Yang et. al, 2012; Zhao et. al, 2015). This includes features based on the presence or number of URLs, hash-tags and user-names, POS tags, punctuation characters as well as 8 different categories of sentiment and emotions.\nOn the arrival of a new message from a stream, all its features are computed and linearly combined using weights obtained from an SVM classifier, yielding the rumour score. We then judge rumours based on an optimal threshold strategy for the rumour score.\nIn addition to novelty based features we introduce another category of features - dubbed Pseudo-Feedback (PF) feature - to boost detection performance. The feature is conceptually related to pseudo relevance feedback found in retrieval and ranking tasks in IR. The concept builds upon the idea that documents, which reveal similar characteristics as previously detected rumours are also likely to be a rumour. During detection, feedback about which of the previous documents describes a rumour is not available. Therefore, we rely on 'pseudo' feedback and consider all documents whose rumour score exceeds a threshold as true rumours.\nThe PF feature describes the maximum similarity between a new document and those documents previously considered as rumour. Similarities are measured by vector proximity in term space. Conceptually, PF passes on evidence to repeated signals by increasing the rumour score of future documents if they are similar to a recently detected rumour. Note that this allows harnessing information from repeated signals without the need of operating retrospectively.\nTraining Pseudo Feedback Features\nThe trainings routine differs from the standard procedure, because the computation of the PF feature requires two training rounds as we require a model of all other features to identify 'pseudo' rumours. In a first training round a SVM is used to compute weights for all features in the trainings set, except the PF features. This provides a model for all but the PF features. Then the trainings set is processed to computing rumour scores based on the model obtained from our initial trainings round. This time, we additionally compute the PF feature value by measuring the minimum distance in term space between the current document vector and those previous documents, whose rumour score exceeds a previously defined threshold. Since we operate on a stream, the number of documents previously considered as rumours grows without bound. To keep operation constant in time and space, we only compare against the k most recent documents considered to be rumours. Once we obtained the value for the PF feature, we compute its weight using the SVM. The combination of the weight for the PF feature with the weights for all other features, obtained in the initial trainings round, resembles the final model.\nThe previous sections introduced two new categories of features for rumour detection. Now we test their performance and impact on detection effectiveness and efficiency. In a streaming setting, documents arrive on a continual basis one at a time. We require our features to compute a rumour-score instantaneously for each document in a single-pass over the data. Messages with high rumour scores are considered likely being rumours. The classification decision is based on an optimal thresholding strategy based on the trainings set.\nWe report accuracy to evaluate effectiveness, as is usual in the literature (Zhou et. al, 2015). Additionally we use the standard TDT evaluation procedure (Allan et. al, 2000; NIST, 2008) with the official TDT3 evaluation scripts (NIST, 2008) using standard settings. This procedure evaluates detection tasks using Detection Error Trade-off (DET) curves, which show the trade-off between miss and false alarm probability. By visualizing the full range of thresholds, DET plots provide a more comprehensive illustration of effectiveness than single value metrics (Allan et. al, 2000). We also evaluate the efficiency of computing the proposed features, measured by the throughput per second, when applied to a high number of messages.\nRumour detection on social media is a novel research field without official data sets. Since licences agreements forbid redistribution of data, no data sets from previous publications are available. We therefore followed previous researchers like Liu et. al (2015) and Yang et. al (2012) and created our own dataset.\ntrusted resources: We randomly collected 200 news articles about broad topics commonly reported by news wires over our target time period. These range from news about celebrities and disasters to financial and political affairs as seen in table 1 . Since we operate on Chinese social media, we gathered news articles from Xinhua News Agency, the leading news-wire in China. To ensure a fair evaluation, we collected the news articles before judging rumours, not knowing which rumours we would find later on. We also only consider news articles published before the timestamps of the social media messages.\nFor our social media stream, we chose Sina Weibo, a Chinese social media service with more than 200 million active users. Micro-blogs from Sina Weibo are denoted as 'weibos'.\nrumours: Sina Weibo offers an official rumour debunking service, operated by trained human professionals. Following Yang et. al (2012) and Zhou et. al (2015), we use this service to obtain a high quality set of 202 confirmed rumours.\nnon-rumours: We additionally gathered 202 non-rumours using the public Sina Weibo API. Three human annotators judged these weibos based on unanimous decision making to ensure that they don't contain rumours.\nSince we operate in a streaming environment, all weibos are sorted based on their publication time-stamp. Table 3 shows a list of example for rumours found in our data set.\nWe ordered the rumours and non-rumours chronologically and divided them in half, forming a training and test set. We ensured that each of the sets consists of 50% rumours and non-rumours. This is important when effectiveness is measured by accuracy. All training and optimization use the trainings set. Performance is then reported based on a single run on the test set.\nTo evaluate our new features for rumour detection, we compare them with two state-of-the-art early rumour detection baselines Liu et. al (2015) and Yang et. al (2012), which we re-implemented. We chose the algorithm by Yang et. al (2012), dubbed Yang, because they proposed a feature set for early detection tailored to Sina Weibo and were used as a state-of-the-art baseline before by Liu et. al (2015). The algorithm by Liu et. al (2015), dubbed Liu, is said to operate in real-time and outperformed Yang, when only considering features available on Twitter. Both apply various message-, user-, topic- and propagation-based features and rely on an SVM classifier which they also found to perform best. The approaches advertise themselves as suitable for early or real-time detection and performed rumour detection with the smallest latency across all published methods. Yang performs early rumour detection and operates with a delay of 24 hours. Liu is claimed to perform in real-time while, requiring a cluster of 5 repeated messages to judge them for rumours. Note that although these algorithm are state-of-the-art for detecting rumours as quickly as possible, they still require a certain delay to reach their full potential.\nTable 2 compares the performance of our features with the two classifiers on the 101 rumours and 101 non-rumours of the test set, when detecting rumour instantly after their publication. The table reveals comparable accuracy for Yang and Liu at around 60%. Our observed performance of Yang matches those by Liu et. al (2015). Surprisingly, the algorithm Liu does not perform significantly better than Yang when applied to instantaneous rumour detection although they claimed to operate in real-time. Liu et. al (2015) report performance based on the first 5 messages which clearly outperforms Yang for early rumour detection. However, we find that when reducing the set from 5 to 1, their superiority is only marginal. In contrast, the combination of novelty and pseudo relevance based features performs significantly better (sign test with $p < 0.05$ ) than the baselines for instantaneous rumour detections. Novelty based features benefit from news articles as an external data source, which explains their superior performance. In particular for instantaneous rumour detection, where information can only be obtained from a single message, the use of external data proves to perform superior. Note that accuracy is a single value metric describing performance at an optimal threshold. Figure 1 compares the effectiveness of the three algorithms for the full range of rumour scores for instantaneous detection. Different applications require a different balance between miss and false alarm. But the DET curve shows that Liu\u2019s method would be preferable over Yang for any application. Similarly, the plot reveals that our approach dominates both baselines throughout all threshold settings and for the high-recall region in particular.\nWhen increasing the detection delay to 12 and 24 hours, all three algorithms reach comparable performance with no statistically significant difference, as seen in table 4. For our approach, none of the features are computed retrospectively, which explains why the performance does not change when increasing the detection delay. The additional time allows Liu and Yang to collect repeated signals, which improves their detection accuracy. After 24 hours Liu performs the highest due to its retrospectively computed features. Note that after 24 hours rumours might have already spread far through social networks and potentially caused harm.\nWe group our 57 features into 7 categories shown in Table 6 and analyse their contribution using feature ablation, as seen in Table 5 . Feature ablation illustrates the importance of a feature by measuring performance, when removing it from the set of features.

A comprehensive study by Castillo et. al (2011) of information credibility assessment widely influenced recent research on rumour detection, whose main focuses lies upon improving detection quality.\nWhile studying the trustworthiness of tweets during crises, Mendoza et. al (2010) found that the topology of a distrustful tweet's propagation pattern differs from those of news and normal tweets. These findings along with the fact that rumours tend to more likely be questioned by responses than news paved the way for future research examining propagation graphs and clustering methods (Cai et. al, 2014; Zhao et. al, 2015). The majority of current research focuses on improving the accuracy of classifiers through new features based on clustering (Cai et. al, 2014; Zhao et. al, 2015), sentiment analysis (Qazvinian et. al, 2011; Wu et. al, 2015) as well as propagation graphs (Kwon, et. al, 2013; Wang et. al, 2015).\nRecent research mainly focuses on further improving the quality of rumour detection while neglecting the increasing delay between the publication and detection of a rumour. The motivation for rumour detection lies in debunking them to prevent them from spreading and causing harm. Unfortunately, state-of-the-art systems operate in a retrospective manner, meaning they detect rumours long after they have spread. The most accurate systems rely on features based on propagation graphs and clustering techniques. These features can only detect rumours after the rumours have spread and already caused harm.\nTherefore, researchers like Liu et. al (2015), Wu et. al (2015), Zhao et. al (2015) and Zhou et. al (2015) focus on 'early rumour-detection' while allowing a delay up to 24 hours. Their focus on latency aware rumour detection makes their approaches conceptually related to ours. Zhao et. al (1015) found clustering tweets containing enquiry patterns as an indication of rumours. Also clustering tweets by keywords and subsequently judging rumours using an ensemble model that combine user, propagation and content-based features proved to be effective (Zhou et. al, 2015). Although the computation of their features is efficient, the need for repeated mentions in the form of response by other users results in increased latency between publication and detection. The approach with the lowest latency banks on the 'wisdom of the crowd' (Liu et. al, 2015). In addition to traditional context and user based features they also rely on clustering micro-blogs by their topicality to identify conflicting claims, which indicate increased likelihood of rumours. Although they claim to operate in real-time, they require a cluster of at least 5 messages to detect a rumour.\nIn contrast, we introduce new features to detect rumours as early as possible - preferably instantly, allowing them to be debunked before they spread and cause harm.\nRumour detection is a challenging task, as it requires determining the truth of information (Zhao et. al, 2015). The Cambridge dictionary, defines a rumour as information of doubtful or unconfirmed truth. We rely on classification using an SVM, which is the state-of-the-art approach for novelty detection. Numerous features have been proposed for rumour detection on social media, many of which originate from an original study on information credibility by Castillo et. al (2011). Unfortunately, the currently most successful features rely on information based on graph propagation and clustering, which can only be computed retrospectively. This renders them close to useless when detecting rumours early on. We introduce two new classes of features, one based on novelty, the other on pseudo feedback. Both feature categories improve detection accuracy early on, when information is limited.\nWe frame the Real-time Rumour Detection task as a classification problem that assesses a document's likelihood of becoming a future rumour at the time of its publication. Consequently, prediction takes place in real-time with a single pass over the data.\nMore formally, we denote by $d_t$ the document that arrives from stream $S:\\lbrace d_0, d_1, . . . d_n\\rbrace $ at time $t$ . Upon arrival of document $d_t$ we compute its corresponding feature vector $f_{d,t}$ . Given $f_{d,t}$ and the previously obtained weigh vector $w$ we compute the rumour score $RS_{d,t} = w^T \\times f_{d,t}$ . The rumour prediction is based on a fixed thresholding strategy with respect to $\\theta $ . We predict that message $d_t$ is likely to become a rumour if its rumour score exceeds the detection threshold $S:\\lbrace d_0, d_1, . . . d_n\\rbrace $0 . The optimal parameter setting for weight vector $S:\\lbrace d_0, d_1, . . . d_n\\rbrace $1 and detection threshold $S:\\lbrace d_0, d_1, . . . d_n\\rbrace $2 are learned on a test to maximise prediction accuracy.\nTo increase instantaneous detection performance, we compensate for the absence of future information by consulting additional data sources. In particular, we make use of news wire articles, which are considered to be of high credibility. This is reasonable as according to Petrovic et. al (2013), in the majority of cases, news wires lead social media for reporting news. When a message arrives from a social media stream, we build features based on its novelty with respect to the confirmed information in the trusted sources. In a nutshell, the presence of information unconfirmed by the official media is construed as an indication of being a rumour. Note that this closely resembles the definition of what a rumour is.\nHigh volume streams demand highly efficient feature computation. This applies in particular to novelty based features since they can be computationally expensive. We explore two approaches to novelty computation: one based on vector proximity, the other on kterm hashing.\nComputing novelty based on traditional vector proximity alone does not yield adequate performance due to the length discrepancy between news wire articles and social media messages. To make vector proximity applicable, we slide a term-level based window, whose length resembles the average social media message length, through each of the news articles. This results in sub-documents whose length resembles those of social media messages. Novelty is computed using term weighted tf-idf dot products between the social media message and all news sub-documents. The inverse of the minimum similarity to the nearest neighbour equates to the degree of novelty.\nThe second approach to compute novelty relies on kterm hashing (Wurzer et. al, 2015), a recent advance in novelty detection that improved the efficiency by an order of magnitude without sacrificing effectiveness. Kterm hashing computes novelty non-comparatively. Instead of measuring similarity between documents, a single representation of previously seen information is constructed. For each document, all possible kterms are formed and hashed onto a Bloom Filter. Novelty is computed by the fraction of unseen kterms. Kterm hashing has the interesting characteristic of forming a collective 'memory', able to span all trusted resources. We exhaustively form kterm for all news articles and store their corresponding hash positions in a Bloom Filter. This filter then captures the combined information of all trusted resources. A single representation allows computing novelty with a single step, instead of comparing each social media message individually with all trusted resources.\nWhen kterm hashing was introduced by Wurzer et. al (2015) for novelty detection on English tweets, they weighted all kterm uniformly. We found that treating all kterms as equally important, does not unlock the full potential of kterm hashing. Therefore, we additionally extract the top 10 keywords ranked by $tf.idf$ and build a separate set of kterms solely based on them. This allows us to compute a dedicated weight for kterms based on these top 10 keywords. The distinction in weights between kterms based on all versus keyword yields superior rumour detection quality, as described in section \"Feature analysis\" . This leaves us with a total of 6 novelty based features for kterm hashing - kterms of length 1 to 3 for all words and keywords.\nApart from novelty based features, we also apply a range of 51 context based features. The full list of features can be found in table 6 . The focus lies on features that can be computed instantly based only on the text of a message to keep the latency of our approach to a minimum. Most of these 51 features overlap with previous studies (Castillo et. al, 2011; Liu et. al, 2015; Qazvinian et. al, 2011; Yang et. al, 2012; Zhao et. al, 2015). This includes features based on the presence or number of URLs, hash-tags and user-names, POS tags, punctuation characters as well as 8 different categories of sentiment and emotions.\nOn the arrival of a new message from a stream, all its features are computed and linearly combined using weights obtained from an SVM classifier, yielding the rumour score. We then judge rumours based on an optimal threshold strategy for the rumour score.\nIn addition to novelty based features we introduce another category of features - dubbed Pseudo-Feedback (PF) feature - to boost detection performance. The feature is conceptually related to pseudo relevance feedback found in retrieval and ranking tasks in IR. The concept builds upon the idea that documents, which reveal similar characteristics as previously detected rumours are also likely to be a rumour. During detection, feedback about which of the previous documents describes a rumour is not available. Therefore, we rely on 'pseudo' feedback and consider all documents whose rumour score exceeds a threshold as true rumours.\nThe PF feature describes the maximum similarity between a new document and those documents previously considered as rumour. Similarities are measured by vector proximity in term space. Conceptually, PF passes on evidence to repeated signals by increasing the rumour score of future documents if they are similar to a recently detected rumour. Note that this allows harnessing information from repeated signals without the need of operating retrospectively.\nTraining Pseudo Feedback Features\nThe trainings routine differs from the standard procedure, because the computation of the PF feature requires two training rounds as we require a model of all other features to identify 'pseudo' rumours. In a first training round a SVM is used to compute weights for all features in the trainings set, except the PF features. This provides a model for all but the PF features. Then the trainings set is processed to computing rumour scores based on the model obtained from our initial trainings round. This time, we additionally compute the PF feature value by measuring the minimum distance in term space between the current document vector and those previous documents, whose rumour score exceeds a previously defined threshold. Since we operate on a stream, the number of documents previously considered as rumours grows without bound. To keep operation constant in time and space, we only compare against the k most recent documents considered to be rumours. Once we obtained the value for the PF feature, we compute its weight using the SVM. The combination of the weight for the PF feature with the weights for all other features, obtained in the initial trainings round, resembles the final model.\nThe previous sections introduced two new categories of features for rumour detection. Now we test their performance and impact on detection effectiveness and efficiency. In a streaming setting, documents arrive on a continual basis one at a time. We require our features to compute a rumour-score instantaneously for each document in a single-pass over the data. Messages with high rumour scores are considered likely being rumours. The classification decision is based on an optimal thresholding strategy based on the trainings set.\nWe report accuracy to evaluate effectiveness, as is usual in the literature (Zhou et. al, 2015). Additionally we use the standard TDT evaluation procedure (Allan et. al, 2000; NIST, 2008) with the official TDT3 evaluation scripts (NIST, 2008) using standard settings. This procedure evaluates detection tasks using Detection Error Trade-off (DET) curves, which show the trade-off between miss and false alarm probability. By visualizing the full range of thresholds, DET plots provide a more comprehensive illustration of effectiveness than single value metrics (Allan et. al, 2000). We also evaluate the efficiency of computing the proposed features, measured by the throughput per second, when applied to a high number of messages.\nRumour detection on social media is a novel research field without official data sets. Since licences agreements forbid redistribution of data, no data sets from previous publications are available. We therefore followed previous researchers like Liu et. al (2015) and Yang et. al (2012) and created our own dataset.\ntrusted resources: We randomly collected 200 news articles about broad topics commonly reported by news wires over our target time period. These range from news about celebrities and disasters to financial and political affairs as seen in table 1 . Since we operate on Chinese social media, we gathered news articles from Xinhua News Agency, the leading news-wire in China. To ensure a fair evaluation, we collected the news articles before judging rumours, not knowing which rumours we would find later on. We also only consider news articles published before the timestamps of the social media messages.\nFor our social media stream, we chose Sina Weibo, a Chinese social media service with more than 200 million active users. Micro-blogs from Sina Weibo are denoted as 'weibos'.\nrumours: Sina Weibo offers an official rumour debunking service, operated by trained human professionals. Following Yang et. al (2012) and Zhou et. al (2015), we use this service to obtain a high quality set of 202 confirmed rumours.\nnon-rumours: We additionally gathered 202 non-rumours using the public Sina Weibo API. Three human annotators judged these weibos based on unanimous decision making to ensure that they don't contain rumours.\nSince we operate in a streaming environment, all weibos are sorted based on their publication time-stamp. Table 3 shows a list of example for rumours found in our data set.\nWe ordered the rumours and non-rumours chronologically and divided them in half, forming a training and test set. We ensured that each of the sets consists of 50% rumours and non-rumours. This is important when effectiveness is measured by accuracy. All training and optimization use the trainings set. Performance is then reported based on a single run on the test set.\nTo evaluate our new features for rumour detection, we compare them with two state-of-the-art early rumour detection baselines Liu et. al (2015) and Yang et. al (2012), which we re-implemented. We chose the algorithm by Yang et. al (2012), dubbed Yang, because they proposed a feature set for early detection tailored to Sina Weibo and were used as a state-of-the-art baseline before by Liu et. al (2015). The algorithm by Liu et. al (2015), dubbed Liu, is said to operate in real-time and outperformed Yang, when only considering features available on Twitter. Both apply various message-, user-, topic- and propagation-based features and rely on an SVM classifier which they also found to perform best. The approaches advertise themselves as suitable for early or real-time detection and performed rumour detection with the smallest latency across all published methods. Yang performs early rumour detection and operates with a delay of 24 hours. Liu is claimed to perform in real-time while, requiring a cluster of 5 repeated messages to judge them for rumours. Note that although these algorithm are state-of-the-art for detecting rumours as quickly as possible, they still require a certain delay to reach their full potential.\nTable 2 compares the performance of our features with the two classifiers on the 101 rumours and 101 non-rumours of the test set, when detecting rumour instantly after their publication. The table reveals comparable accuracy for Yang and Liu at around 60%. Our observed performance of Yang matches those by Liu et. al (2015). Surprisingly, the algorithm Liu does not perform significantly better than Yang when applied to instantaneous rumour detection although they claimed to operate in real-time. Liu et. al (2015) report performance based on the first 5 messages which clearly outperforms Yang for early rumour detection. However, we find that when reducing the set from 5 to 1, their superiority is only marginal. In contrast, the combination of novelty and pseudo relevance based features performs significantly better (sign test with $p < 0.05$ ) than the baselines for instantaneous rumour detections. Novelty based features benefit from news articles as an external data source, which explains their superior performance. In particular for instantaneous rumour detection, where information can only be obtained from a single message, the use of external data proves to perform superior. Note that accuracy is a single value metric describing performance at an optimal threshold. Figure 1 compares the effectiveness of the three algorithms for the full range of rumour scores for instantaneous detection. Different applications require a different balance between miss and false alarm. But the DET curve shows that Liu\u2019s method would be preferable over Yang for any application. Similarly, the plot reveals that our approach dominates both baselines throughout all threshold settings and for the high-recall region in particular.\nWhen increasing the detection delay to 12 and 24 hours, all three algorithms reach comparable performance with no statistically significant difference, as seen in table 4. For our approach, none of the features are computed retrospectively, which explains why the performance does not change when increasing the detection delay. The additional time allows Liu and Yang to collect repeated signals, which improves their detection accuracy. After 24 hours Liu performs the highest due to its retrospectively computed features. Note that after 24 hours rumours might have already spread far through social networks and potentially caused harm.\nWe group our 57 features into 7 categories shown in Table 6 and analyse their contribution using feature ablation, as seen in Table 5 . Feature ablation illustrates the importance of a feature by measuring performance, when removing it from the set of features. Novelty related features based on kterm hashing were found to be dominant for instantaneous rumour detection $(p < 0.05)$ . 'Sentence char' features, which include punctuation, hashtags, user-symbols and URLs, contributed the most of the traditional features, followed by Part of Speech ('POS') and 'extreme word' features. Our experiments found 'sentiment' and 'emotion' based features to contribute the least. Since excluding them both results in a considerable drop of performance we conclude that they capture comparable information and therefore compensated for each other.\nNovelty based Features\nNovelty based features revealed the highest impact on detection performance. In particular kterms formed from the top keywords contribute the most. This is interesting, as when kterm hashing was introduced (Wurzer et. al, 2015), all kterms were considered as equally important. We found that prioritising certain kterms yields increased performance.\nInterestingly, novelty based features computed by the vector similarity between weibos and news sub-documents perform slightly worse (-2% absolute). When striping all but the top tf-idf weighted terms from the news sub-documents, the hit in performance can be reduced to -1 % absolute. Kterm constructs a combined memory of all information presented to it. Pulling all information into a single representation bridges the gab between documents and allows finding information matches within documents. We hypothesize that this causes increased detection performance.\nPseudo Feedbaack\nFeatures ablation revealed that pseudo feedback (PF) increased detection performance by 5.3% (relative). PF builds upon the output of the other features. High performance of the other features results in higher positive impact of PF. We want to further explore the behaviour of PF when other features perform badly in future studies.\nPrevious approaches to rumour detection rely on repeated signals to form propagation graphs or clustering methods. Beside causing a detection delay these methods are also blind to less popular rumours that don't go viral. In contrast, novelty based feature require only a single message enabling them to detect even the smallest rumours. Examples for such small rumours are shown in table 3 .\nTo demonstrate the high efficiency of computing novelty and pseudo feedback features, we implement a rumour detection system and measure its throughput when applied to 100k weibos. We implement our system in C and run it using a single core on a 2.2GHz Intel Core i7-4702HQ. We measure the throughput on an idle machine and average the observed performance over 5 runs. Figure 2 presents performance when processing more and more weibos. The average throughput of our system is around 7,000 weibos per second, which clearly exceeds the average volume of the full Twitter (5,700 tweets/sec.) and Sina Weibo (1,200 weibos/sec.) stream. Since the number of news articles is relatively small, we find no difference in terms of efficiency between computing novelty features based on kterm hashing and vector similarity. Figure 2 also illustrates that our proposed features can be computed in constant time with respect to the number of messages processed. This is crucial to keep operation in a true streaming environment feasible. Approaches, whose runtime depend on the number of documents processed become progressively slower, which is inapplicable when operating on data streams. Our experiments show that the proposed features perform effectively and their efficiency allows them to detect rumours instantly after their publication.\nWe introduced two new categories of features which significantly improve instantaneous rumour detection performance. Novelty based features consider the increased presence of unconfirmed information within a message with respect to trusted sources as an indication of being a rumour. Pseudo feedback features consider messages that are similar to previously detected rumours as more likely to also be a rumour. Pseudo feedback and its variant, recursive pseudo feedback, allow harnessing repeated signals without the need of operating retrospectively. Our evaluation showed that novelty and pseudo feedback based features perform significantly more effective than other real-time and early detection baselines, when detecting rumours instantly after their publication. This advantage vanishes when allowing an increased detection delay. We also showed that the proposed features can be computed efficiently enough to operate on the average Twitter and Sina Weibo stream while keeping time and space requirements constant.", "question": "Are their methods fully supervised?", "expected_output": "No. They additionally use similarity to previously detected rumors to make the decision of whether a document is likely to be a rumor.

{"id": "1611.06322", "prompt": "Social Media has evolved from friendship based networks to become a major source for the consumption of news (NIST, 2008). On social media, news is decentralised as it provides everyone the means to efficiently report and spread information. In contrast to traditional news wire, information on social media is spread without intensive investigation, fact and background checking. The combination of ease and fast pace of sharing information provides a fertile breeding ground for rumours, false- and disinformation. Social media users tend to share controversial information in-order to verify it, while asking about for the opinions of their followers (Zhao et. al, 2015). This further amplifies the pace of a rumour's spread and reach. Rumours and deliberate disinformation have already caused panic and influenced public opinion.\nThe cases in Germany and Austria in 2016, show how misleading and false information about crimes committed by refugees negatively influenced the opinion of citizens.\nDetecting these rumours allows debunking them to prevent them from further spreading and causing harm. The further a rumour has spread, the more likely it is to be debunked by users or traditional media (Liu et. al, 2015). However, by then rumours might have already caused harm. This highlights the importance and necessity of recognizing rumours as early as possible - preferably instantaneously.\nRumour detection on social media is challenging due to the short texts, creative lexical variations and high volume of the streams. The task becomes even harder if we attempt to perform rumour detection on-the-fly, without looking into the future. We provide an effective and highly scalable approach to detect rumours instantly after they were posted with zero delay. We introduce a new features category called novelty based features. Novelty based features compensate the absence of repeated information by consulting additional data sources - news wire articles. We hypothesize that information not confirmed by official news is an indication of rumours. Additionally we introduce pseudo feedback for classification. In a nutshell, documents that are similar to previously detected rumours are considered to be more likely to also be a rumour. The proposed features can be computed in constant time and space allowing us to process high-volume streams in real-time (Muthukrishnan, 2005). Our experiments reveal that novelty based features and pseudo feedback significantly increases detection performance for early rumour detection.\nThe contributions of this paper include:\nNovelty based Features\nWe introduced a new category of features for instant rumour detection that harnesses trusted resources. Unconfirmed (novel) information with respect to trusted resources is considered as an indication of rumours.\nPseudo Feedback for Detection/Classification\nPseudo feedback increases detection accuracy by harnessing repeated signals, without the need of retrospective operation.\nBefore rumour detection, scientists already studied the related problem of information credibility evaluation (Castillo et. al. 2011; Richardson et. al, 2003). Recently, automated rumour detection on social media evolved into a popular research field which also relies on assessing the credibility of messages and their sources. The most successful methods proposed focus on classification harnessing lexical, user-centric, propagation-based (Wu et. al, 2015) and cluster-based (Cai et. al, 2014; Liu et. al, 2015; Zhao et. al, 2015) features.\nMany of these context based features originate from a study by Castillo et. al (2011), which pioneered in engineering features for credibility assessment on Twitter (Liu et. al, 2015). They observed a significant correlation between the trustworthiness of a tweet with context-based characteristics including hashtags, punctuation characters and sentiment polarity. When assessing the credibility of a tweet, they also assessed the source of its information by constructing features based on provided URLs as well as user based features like the activeness of the user and social graph based features like the frequency of re-tweets.

Similarities are measured by vector proximity in term space. Conceptually, PF passes on evidence to repeated signals by increasing the rumour score of future documents if they are similar to a recently detected rumour. Note that this allows harnessing information from repeated signals without the need of operating retrospectively.\nTraining Pseudo Feedback Features\nThe trainings routine differs from the standard procedure, because the computation of the PF feature requires two training rounds as we require a model of all other features to identify 'pseudo' rumours. In a first training round a SVM is used to compute weights for all features in the trainings set, except the PF features. This provides a model for all but the PF features. Then the trainings set is processed to computing rumour scores based on the model obtained from our initial trainings round. This time, we additionally compute the PF feature value by measuring the minimum distance in term space between the current document vector and those previous documents, whose rumour score exceeds a previously defined threshold. Since we operate on a stream, the number of documents previously considered as rumours grows without bound. To keep operation constant in time and space, we only compare against the k most recent documents considered to be rumours. Once we obtained the value for the PF feature, we compute its weight using the SVM. The combination of the weight for the PF feature with the weights for all other features, obtained in the initial trainings round, resembles the final model.\nThe previous sections introduced two new categories of features for rumour detection. Now we test their performance and impact on detection effectiveness and efficiency. In a streaming setting, documents arrive on a continual basis one at a time. We require our features to compute a rumour-score instantaneously for each document in a single-pass over the data. Messages with high rumour scores are considered likely being rumours. The classification decision is based on an optimal thresholding strategy based on the trainings set.\nWe report accuracy to evaluate effectiveness, as is usual in the literature (Zhou et. al, 2015). Additionally we use the standard TDT evaluation procedure (Allan et. al, 2000; NIST, 2008) with the official TDT3 evaluation scripts (NIST, 2008) using standard settings. This procedure evaluates detection tasks using Detection Error Trade-off (DET) curves, which show the trade-off between miss and false alarm probability. By visualizing the full range of thresholds, DET plots provide a more comprehensive illustration of effectiveness than single value metrics (Allan et. al, 2000). We also evaluate the efficiency of computing the proposed features, measured by the throughput per second, when applied to a high number of messages.\nRumour detection on social media is a novel research field without official data sets. Since licences agreements forbid redistribution of data, no data sets from previous publications are available. We therefore followed previous researchers like Liu et. al (2015) and Yang et. al (2012) and created our own dataset.\ntrusted resources: We randomly collected 200 news articles about broad topics commonly reported by news wires over our target time period. These range from news about celebrities and disasters to financial and political affairs as seen in table 1 . Since we operate on Chinese social media, we gathered news articles from Xinhua News Agency, the leading news-wire in China. To ensure a fair evaluation, we collected the news articles before judging rumours, not knowing which rumours we would find later on. We also only consider news articles published before the timestamps of the social media messages.\nFor our social media stream, we chose Sina Weibo, a Chinese social media service with more than 200 million active users. Micro-blogs from Sina Weibo are denoted as 'weibos'.\nrumours: Sina Weibo offers an official rumour debunking service, operated by trained human professionals. Following Yang et. al (2012) and Zhou et. al (2015), we use this service to obtain a high quality set of 202 confirmed rumours.\nnon-rumours: We additionally gathered 202 non-rumours using the public Sina Weibo API. Three human annotators judged these weibos based on unanimous decision making to ensure that they don't contain rumours.\nSince we operate in a streaming environment, all weibos are sorted based on their publication time-stamp. Table 3 shows a list of example for rumours found in our data set.\nWe ordered the rumours and non-rumours chronologically and divided them in half, forming a training and test set. We ensured that each of the sets consists of 50% rumours and non-rumours. This is important when effectiveness is measured by accuracy. All training and optimization use the trainings set. Performance is then reported based on a single run on the test set.\nTo evaluate our new features for rumour detection, we compare them with two state-of-the-art early rumour detection baselines Liu et. al (2015) and Yang et. al (2012), which we re-implemented. We chose the algorithm by Yang et. al (2012), dubbed Yang, because they proposed a feature set for early detection tailored to Sina Weibo and were used as a state-of-the-art baseline before by Liu et. al (2015). The algorithm by Liu et. al (2015), dubbed Liu, is said to operate in real-time and outperformed Yang, when only considering features available on Twitter. Both apply various message-, user-, topic- and propagation-based features and rely on an SVM classifier which they also found to perform best. The approaches advertise themselves as suitable for early or real-time detection and performed rumour detection with the smallest latency across all published methods. Yang performs early rumour detection and operates with a delay of 24 hours. Liu is claimed to perform in real-time while, requiring a cluster of 5 repeated messages to judge them for rumours. Note that although these algorithm are state-of-the-art for detecting rumours as quickly as possible, they still require a certain delay to reach their full potential.\nTable 2 compares the performance of our features with the two classifiers on the 101 rumours and 101 non-rumours of the test set, when detecting rumour instantly after their publication. The table reveals comparable accuracy for Yang and Liu at around 60%. Our observed performance of Yang matches those by Liu et. al (2015). Surprisingly, the algorithm Liu does not perform significantly better than Yang when applied to instantaneous rumour detection although they claimed to operate in real-time. Liu et. al (2015) report performance based on the first 5 messages which clearly outperforms Yang for early rumour detection. However, we find that when reducing the set from 5 to 1, their superiority is only marginal. In contrast, the combination of novelty and pseudo relevance based features performs significantly better (sign test with $p < 0.05$ ) than the baselines for instantaneous rumour detections. Novelty based features benefit from news articles as an external data source, which explains their superior performance. In particular for instantaneous rumour detection, where information can only be obtained from a single message, the use of external data proves to perform superior. Note that accuracy is a single value metric describing performance at an optimal threshold. Figure 1 compares the effectiveness of the three algorithms for the full range of rumour scores for instantaneous detection. Different applications require a different balance between miss and false alarm. But the DET curve shows that Liu\u2019s method would be preferable over Yang for any application. Similarly, the plot reveals that our approach dominates both baselines throughout all threshold settings and for the high-recall region in particular.\nWhen increasing the detection delay to 12 and 24 hours, all three algorithms reach comparable performance with no statistically significant difference, as seen in table 4. For our approach, none of the features are computed retrospectively, which explains why the performance does not change when increasing the detection delay. The additional time allows Liu and Yang to collect repeated signals, which improves their detection accuracy. After 24 hours Liu performs the highest due to its retrospectively computed features. Note that after 24 hours rumours might have already spread far through social networks and potentially caused harm.\nWe group our 57 features into 7 categories shown in Table 6 and analyse their contribution using feature ablation, as seen in Table 5 . Feature ablation illustrates the importance of a feature by measuring performance, when removing it from the set of features. Novelty related features based on kterm hashing were found to be dominant for instantaneous rumour detection $(p < 0.05)$ . 'Sentence char' features, which include punctuation, hashtags, user-symbols and URLs, contributed the most of the traditional features, followed by Part of Speech ('POS') and 'extreme word' features. Our experiments found 'sentiment' and 'emotion' based features to contribute the least. Since excluding them both results in a considerable drop of performance we conclude that they capture comparable information and therefore compensated for each other.\nNovelty based Features\nNovelty based features revealed the highest impact on detection performance. In particular kterms formed from the top keywords contribute the most. This is interesting, as when kterm hashing was introduced (Wurzer et. al, 2015), all kterms were considered as equally important. We found that prioritising certain kterms yields increased performance.\nInterestingly, novelty based features computed by the vector similarity between weibos and news sub-documents perform slightly worse (-2% absolute). When striping all but the top tf-idf weighted terms from the news sub-documents, the hit in performance can be reduced to -1 % absolute. Kterm constructs a combined memory of all information presented to it. Pulling all information into a single representation bridges the gab between documents and allows finding information matches within documents. We hypothesize that this causes increased detection performance.\nPseudo Feedbaack\nFeatures ablation revealed that pseudo feedback (PF) increased detection performance by 5.3% (relative). PF builds upon the output of the other features. High performance of the other features results in higher positive impact of PF. We want to further explore the behaviour of PF when other features perform badly in future studies.\nPrevious approaches to rumour detection rely on repeated signals to form propagation graphs or clustering methods. Beside causing a detection delay these methods are also blind to less popular rumours that don't go viral. In contrast, novelty based feature require only a single message enabling them to detect even the smallest rumours. Examples for such small rumours are shown in table 3 .\nTo demonstrate the high efficiency of computing novelty and pseudo feedback features, we implement a rumour detection system and measure its throughput when applied to 100k weibos. We implement our system in C and run it using a single core on a 2.2GHz Intel Core i7-4702HQ. We measure the throughput on an idle machine and average the observed performance over 5 runs. Figure 2 presents performance when processing more and more weibos. The average throughput of our system is around 7,000 weibos per second, which clearly exceeds the average volume of the full Twitter (5,700 tweets/sec.) and Sina Weibo (1,200 weibos/sec.) stream. Since the number of news articles is relatively small, we find no difference in terms of efficiency between computing novelty features based on kterm hashing and vector similarity. Figure 2 also illustrates that our proposed features can be computed in constant time with respect to the number of messages processed. This is crucial to keep operation in a true streaming environment feasible. Approaches, whose runtime depend on the number of documents processed become progressively slower, which is inapplicable when operating on data streams. Our experiments show that the proposed features perform effectively and their efficiency allows them to detect rumours instantly after their publication.\nWe introduced two new categories of features which significantly improve instantaneous rumour detection performance. Novelty based features consider the increased presence of unconfirmed information within a message with respect to trusted sources as an indication of being a rumour. Pseudo feedback features consider messages that are similar to previously detected rumours as more likely to also be a rumour. Pseudo feedback and its variant, recursive pseudo feedback, allow harnessing repeated signals without the need of operating retrospectively. Our evaluation showed that novelty and pseudo feedback based features perform significantly more effective than other real-time and early detection baselines, when detecting rumours instantly after their publication. This advantage vanishes when allowing an increased detection delay. We also showed that the proposed features can be computed efficiently enough to operate on the average Twitter and Sina Weibo stream while keeping time and space requirements constant.", "question": "What languages do they evaluate their methods on?", "expected_output": "Chinese.

{"id": "1611.06322", "prompt": "Social Media has evolved from friendship based networks to become a major source for the consumption of news (NIST, 2008). On social media, news is decentralised as it provides everyone the means to efficiently report and spread information. In contrast to traditional news wire, information on social media is spread without intensive investigation, fact and background checking. The combination of ease and fast pace of sharing information provides a fertile breeding ground for rumours, false- and disinformation. Social media users tend to share controversial information in-order to verify it, while asking about for the opinions of their followers (Zhao et. al, 2015). This further amplifies the pace of a rumour's spread and reach. Rumours and deliberate disinformation have already caused panic and influenced public opinion.\nThe cases in Germany and Austria in 2016, show how misleading and false information about crimes committed by refugees negatively influenced the opinion of citizens.\nDetecting these rumours allows debunking them to prevent them from further spreading and causing harm. The further a rumour has spread, the more likely it is to be debunked by users or traditional media (Liu et. al, 2015). However, by then rumours might have already caused harm. This highlights the importance and necessity of recognizing rumours as early as possible - preferably instantaneously.\nRumour detection on social media is challenging due to the short texts, creative lexical variations and high volume of the streams. The task becomes even harder if we attempt to perform rumour detection on-the-fly, without looking into the future. We provide an effective and highly scalable approach to detect rumours instantly after they were posted with zero delay. We introduce a new features category called novelty based features. Novelty based features compensate the absence of repeated information by consulting additional data sources - news wire articles. We hypothesize that information not confirmed by official news is an indication of rumours. Additionally we introduce pseudo feedback for classification. In a nutshell, documents that are similar to previously detected rumours are considered to be more likely to also be a rumour. The proposed features can be computed in constant time and space allowing us to process high-volume streams in real-time (Muthukrishnan, 2005). Our experiments reveal that novelty based features and pseudo feedback significantly increases detection performance for early rumour detection.\nThe contributions of this paper include:\nNovelty based Features\nWe introduced a new category of features for instant rumour detection that harnesses trusted resources. Unconfirmed (novel) information with respect to trusted resources is considered as an indication of rumours.\nPseudo Feedback for Detection/Classification\nPseudo feedback increases detection accuracy by harnessing repeated signals, without the need of retrospective operation.\nBefore rumour detection, scientists already studied the related problem of information credibility evaluation (Castillo et. al. 2011; Richardson et. al, 2003). Recently, automated rumour detection on social media evolved into a popular research field which also relies on assessing the credibility of messages and their sources. The most successful methods proposed focus on classification harnessing lexical, user-centric, propagation-based (Wu et. al, 2015) and cluster-based (Cai et. al, 2014; Liu et. al, 2015; Zhao et. al, 2015) features.\nMany of these context based features originate from a study by Castillo et. al (2011), which pioneered in engineering features for credibility assessment on Twitter (Liu et. al, 2015). They observed a significant correlation between the trustworthiness of a tweet with context-based characteristics including hashtags, punctuation characters and sentiment polarity. When assessing the credibility of a tweet, they also assessed the source of its information by constructing features based on provided URLs as well as user based features like the activeness of the user and social graph based features like the frequency of re-tweets. A comprehensive study by Castillo et. al (2011) of information credibility assessment widely influenced recent research on rumour detection, whose main focuses lies upon improving detection quality.\nWhile studying the trustworthiness of tweets during crises, Mendoza et. al (2010) found that the topology of a distrustful tweet's propagation pattern differs from those of news and normal tweets. These findings along with the fact that rumours tend to more likely be questioned by responses than news paved the way for future research examining propagation graphs and clustering methods (Cai et. al, 2014; Zhao et. al, 2015). The majority of current research focuses on improving the accuracy of classifiers through new features based on clustering (Cai et. al, 2014; Zhao et. al, 2015), sentiment analysis (Qazvinian et. al, 2011; Wu et. al, 2015) as well as propagation graphs (Kwon, et. al, 2013; Wang et. al, 2015).\nRecent research mainly focuses on further improving the quality of rumour detection while neglecting the increasing delay between the publication and detection of a rumour. The motivation for rumour detection lies in debunking them to prevent them from spreading and causing harm. Unfortunately, state-of-the-art systems operate in a retrospective manner, meaning they detect rumours long after they have spread. The most accurate systems rely on features based on propagation graphs and clustering techniques. These features can only detect rumours after the rumours have spread and already caused harm.\nTherefore, researchers like Liu et. al (2015), Wu et. al (2015), Zhao et. al (2015) and Zhou et. al (2015) focus on 'early rumour-detection' while allowing a delay up to 24 hours. Their focus on latency aware rumour detection makes their approaches conceptually related to ours. Zhao et. al (1015) found clustering tweets containing enquiry patterns as an indication of rumours. Also clustering tweets by keywords and subsequently judging rumours using an ensemble model that combine user, propagation and content-based features proved to be effective (Zhou et. al, 2015). Although the computation of their features is efficient, the need for repeated mentions in the form of response by other users results in increased latency between publication and detection. The approach with the lowest latency banks on the 'wisdom of the crowd' (Liu et. al, 2015). In addition to traditional context and user based features they also rely on clustering micro-blogs by their topicality to identify conflicting claims, which indicate increased likelihood of rumours. Although they claim to operate in real-time, they require a cluster of at least 5 messages to detect a rumour.\nIn contrast, we introduce new features to detect rumours as early as possible - preferably instantly, allowing them to be debunked before they spread and cause harm.\nRumour detection is a challenging task, as it requires determining the truth of information (Zhao et. al, 2015). The Cambridge dictionary, defines a rumour as information of doubtful or unconfirmed truth. We rely on classification using an SVM, which is the state-of-the-art approach for novelty detection. Numerous features have been proposed for rumour detection on social media, many of which originate from an original study on information credibility by Castillo et. al (2011). Unfortunately, the currently most successful features rely on information based on graph propagation and clustering, which can only be computed retrospectively. This renders them close to useless when detecting rumours early on. We introduce two new classes of features, one based on novelty, the other on pseudo feedback. Both feature categories improve detection accuracy early on, when information is limited.\nWe frame the Real-time Rumour Detection task as a classification problem that assesses a document's likelihood of becoming a future rumour at the time of its publication. Consequently, prediction takes place in real-time with a single pass over the data.\nMore formally, we denote by $d_t$ the document that arrives from stream $S:\\lbrace d_0, d_1, . . . d_n\\rbrace $ at time $t$ . Upon arrival of document $d_t$ we compute its corresponding feature vector $f_{d,t}$ . Given $f_{d,t}$ and the previously obtained weigh vector $w$ we compute the rumour score $RS_{d,t} = w^T \\times f_{d,t}$ . The rumour prediction is based on a fixed thresholding strategy with respect to $\\theta $ . We predict that message $d_t$ is likely to become a rumour if its rumour score exceeds the detection threshold $S:\\lbrace d_0, d_1, . . . d_n\\rbrace $0 . The optimal parameter setting for weight vector $S:\\lbrace d_0, d_1, . . . d_n\\rbrace $1 and detection threshold $S:\\lbrace d_0, d_1, . . . d_n\\rbrace $2 are learned on a test to maximise prediction accuracy.\nTo increase instantaneous detection performance, we compensate for the absence of future information by consulting additional data sources. In particular, we make use of news wire articles, which are considered to be of high credibility. This is reasonable as according to Petrovic et. al (2013), in the majority of cases, news wires lead social media for reporting news. When a message arrives from a social media stream, we build features based on its novelty with respect to the confirmed information in the trusted sources. In a nutshell, the presence of information unconfirmed by the official media is construed as an indication of being a rumour. Note that this closely resembles the definition of what a rumour is.\nHigh volume streams demand highly efficient feature computation. This applies in particular to novelty based features since they can be computationally expensive. We explore two approaches to novelty computation: one based on vector proximity, the other on kterm hashing.\nComputing novelty based on traditional vector proximity alone does not yield adequate performance due to the length discrepancy between news wire articles and social media messages. To make vector proximity applicable, we slide a term-level based window, whose length resembles the average social media message length, through each of the news articles. This results in sub-documents whose length resembles those of social media messages. Novelty is computed using term weighted tf-idf dot products between the social media message and all news sub-documents. The inverse of the minimum similarity to the nearest neighbour equates to the degree of novelty.\nThe second approach to compute novelty relies on kterm hashing (Wurzer et. al, 2015), a recent advance in novelty detection that improved the efficiency by an order of magnitude without sacrificing effectiveness. Kterm hashing computes novelty non-comparatively. Instead of measuring similarity between documents, a single representation of previously seen information is constructed. For each document, all possible kterms are formed and hashed onto a Bloom Filter. Novelty is computed by the fraction of unseen kterms. Kterm hashing has the interesting characteristic of forming a collective 'memory', able to span all trusted resources. We exhaustively form kterm for all news articles and store their corresponding hash positions in a Bloom Filter. This filter then captures the combined information of all trusted resources. A single representation allows computing novelty with a single step, instead of comparing each social media message individually with all trusted resources.\nWhen kterm hashing was introduced by Wurzer et. al (2015) for novelty detection on English tweets, they weighted all kterm uniformly. We found that treating all kterms as equally important, does not unlock the full potential of kterm hashing. Therefore, we additionally extract the top 10 keywords ranked by $tf.idf$ and build a separate set of kterms solely based on them. This allows us to compute a dedicated weight for kterms based on these top 10 keywords. The distinction in weights between kterms based on all versus keyword yields superior rumour detection quality, as described in section \"Feature analysis\" . This leaves us with a total of 6 novelty based features for kterm hashing - kterms of length 1 to 3 for all words and keywords.\nApart from novelty based features, we also apply a range of 51 context based features. The full list of features can be found in table 6 . The focus lies on features that can be computed instantly based only on the text of a message to keep the latency of our approach to a minimum. Most of these 51 features overlap with previous studies (Castillo et. al, 2011; Liu et. al, 2015; Qazvinian et. al, 2011; Yang et. al, 2012; Zhao et. al, 2015). This includes features based on the presence or number of URLs, hash-tags and user-names, POS tags, punctuation characters as well as 8 different categories of sentiment and emotions.\nOn the arrival of a new message from a stream, all its features are computed and linearly combined using weights obtained from an SVM classifier, yielding the rumour score. We then judge rumours based on an optimal threshold strategy for the rumour score.\nIn addition to novelty based features we introduce another category of features - dubbed Pseudo-Feedback (PF) feature - to boost detection performance. The feature is conceptually related to pseudo relevance feedback found in retrieval and ranking tasks in IR. The concept builds upon the idea that documents, which reveal similar characteristics as previously detected rumours are also likely to be a rumour. During detection, feedback about which of the previous documents describes a rumour is not available. Therefore, we rely on 'pseudo' feedback and consider all documents whose rumour score exceeds a threshold as true rumours.\nThe PF feature describes the maximum similarity between a new document and those documents previously considered as rumour. Similarities are measured by vector proximity in term space. Conceptually, PF passes on evidence to repeated signals by increasing the rumour score of future documents if they are similar to a recently detected rumour. Note that this allows harnessing information from repeated signals without the need of operating retrospectively.\nTraining Pseudo Feedback Features\nThe trainings routine differs from the standard procedure, because the computation of the PF feature requires two training rounds as we require a model of all other features to identify 'pseudo' rumours. In a first training round a SVM is used to compute weights for all features in the trainings set, except the PF features. This provides a model for all but the PF features. Then the trainings set is processed to computing rumour scores based on the model obtained from our initial trainings round. This time, we additionally compute the PF feature value by measuring the minimum distance in term space between the current document vector and those previous documents, whose rumour score exceeds a previously defined threshold. Since we operate on a stream, the number of documents previously considered as rumours grows without bound. To keep operation constant in time and space, we only compare against the k most recent documents considered to be rumours. Once we obtained the value for the PF feature, we compute its weight using the SVM. The combination of the weight for the PF feature with the weights for all other features, obtained in the initial trainings round, resembles the final model.\nThe previous sections introduced two new categories of features for rumour detection. Now we test their performance and impact on detection effectiveness and efficiency. In a streaming setting, documents arrive on a continual basis one at a time.

PF builds upon the output of the other features. High performance of the other features results in higher positive impact of PF. We want to further explore the behaviour of PF when other features perform badly in future studies.\nPrevious approaches to rumour detection rely on repeated signals to form propagation graphs or clustering methods. Beside causing a detection delay these methods are also blind to less popular rumours that don't go viral. In contrast, novelty based feature require only a single message enabling them to detect even the smallest rumours. Examples for such small rumours are shown in table 3 .\nTo demonstrate the high efficiency of computing novelty and pseudo feedback features, we implement a rumour detection system and measure its throughput when applied to 100k weibos. We implement our system in C and run it using a single core on a 2.2GHz Intel Core i7-4702HQ. We measure the throughput on an idle machine and average the observed performance over 5 runs. Figure 2 presents performance when processing more and more weibos. The average throughput of our system is around 7,000 weibos per second, which clearly exceeds the average volume of the full Twitter (5,700 tweets/sec.) and Sina Weibo (1,200 weibos/sec.) stream. Since the number of news articles is relatively small, we find no difference in terms of efficiency between computing novelty features based on kterm hashing and vector similarity. Figure 2 also illustrates that our proposed features can be computed in constant time with respect to the number of messages processed. This is crucial to keep operation in a true streaming environment feasible. Approaches, whose runtime depend on the number of documents processed become progressively slower, which is inapplicable when operating on data streams. Our experiments show that the proposed features perform effectively and their efficiency allows them to detect rumours instantly after their publication.\nWe introduced two new categories of features which significantly improve instantaneous rumour detection performance. Novelty based features consider the increased presence of unconfirmed information within a message with respect to trusted sources as an indication of being a rumour. Pseudo feedback features consider messages that are similar to previously detected rumours as more likely to also be a rumour. Pseudo feedback and its variant, recursive pseudo feedback, allow harnessing repeated signals without the need of operating retrospectively. Our evaluation showed that novelty and pseudo feedback based features perform significantly more effective than other real-time and early detection baselines, when detecting rumours instantly after their publication. This advantage vanishes when allowing an increased detection delay. We also showed that the proposed features can be computed efficiently enough to operate on the average Twitter and Sina Weibo stream while keeping time and space requirements constant.", "question": "How do they define rumors?", "expected_output": "the presence of information unconfirmed by the official media is construed as an indication of being a rumour..

{"id": "1604.02038", "prompt": "Statistic topic models such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and its variants BIBREF0 , BIBREF1 , BIBREF2 , BIBREF3 , BIBREF4 have been proven to be effective in modeling textual documents. In these models, a word token in a document is assumed to be generated by a hidden mixture model, where the hidden variables are the topic indexes for each word and the topic assignments for words are related to document level topic weights. Due to the effectiveness and efficiency in modeling the document generation process, topic models are widely adopted in quite a lot of real world tasks such as sentiment classification BIBREF5 , social network analysis BIBREF6 , BIBREF5 , and recommendation systems BIBREF7 .\nMost topic models take the bag-of-words assumption, in which every document is treated as an unordered set of words and the word tokens in such a document are sampled independently with each other. The bag-of-words assumption brings computational convenience, however, it sacrifices the characterization of sequential properties of words in a document and the topic coherence between words belonging to the same language segment (e.g., sentence). As a result, people have observed many negative examples. Just list one for illustration BIBREF8 : the department chair couches offers and the chair department offers couches have very different topics, although they have exactly the same bag of words.\nThere have been some works trying to solve the aforementioned problems, although still insufficiently. For example, several sentence level topic models BIBREF9 , BIBREF10 , BIBREF11 tackle the topic coherence problem by assuming all the words in a sentence to share the same topic (i.e., every sentence has only one topic). In addition, they model the sequential information by assuming the transition between sentence topics to be Markovian. However, words within the same sentence are still exchangeable in these models, and thus the bag-of-words assumption still holds within a sentence. For another example, in BIBREF12 , the embedding based neural language model BIBREF13 , BIBREF14 , BIBREF15 and topic model are integrated. They assume the generation of a given word in a sentence to depend on its local context (including its preceding words within a fixed window) as well as the topics of the sentence and document it lies in. However, using a fixed window of preceding words, instead of the whole word stream within a sentence, could only introduce limited sequential dependency. Furthermore, there is no explicit coherence constraints on the word topics and sentence topics, since every word can have its own topics in their model.\nWe propose Sentence Level Recurrent Topic Model (SLRTM) to tackle the limitations of the aforementioned works. In the new model, we assume the words in the same sentence to share the same topic in order to guarantee topic coherence, and we assume the generation of a word to rely on the whole history in the same sentence in order to fully characterize the sequential dependency. Specifically, for a particular word INLINEFORM0 within a sentence INLINEFORM1 , we assume its generation depends on two factors: the first is the whole set of its historical words in the sentence and the second is the sentence topic, which we regard as a pseudo word and has its own distributed representations. We use Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) BIBREF16 , such as Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) BIBREF17 or Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) network BIBREF18 , to model such a long term dependency.\nWith the proposed SLRTM, we can not only model the document generation process more accurately, but also construct new natural sentences that are coherent with a given topic (we call it topic2sentence, similar to image2sentece BIBREF19 ). Topic2sentence has its huge potential for many real world tasks. For example, it can serve as the basis of personalized short text conversation system BIBREF20 , BIBREF21 , in which once we detect that the user is interested in certain topics, we can let these topics speak for themselves using SLRTM to improve the user satisfactory.\nWe have conducted experiments to compare SLRTM with several strong topic model baselines on two tasks: generative model evaluation (i.e. test set perplexity) and document classification. The results on several benchmark datasets quantitatively demonstrate SLRTM's advantages in modeling documents. We further provide some qualitative results on topic2sentence, the generated sentences for different topics clearly demonstrate the power of SLRTM in topic-sensitive short text conversations.\nOne of the most representative topic models is Latent Dirichlet Allocation BIBREF2 , in which every word in a document has its topic drawn from document level topic weights. Several variants of LDA have been developed such as hierarchical topic models BIBREF22 and supervised topic models BIBREF3 . With the recent development of deep learning, there are also neural network based topic models such as BIBREF23 , BIBREF24 , BIBREF25 , BIBREF26 , which use distributed representations of words to improve topic semantics.\nMost of the aforementioned works take the bag-of-words assumption, which might be too simple according to our discussions in the introduction. That is, it ignores both sequential dependency of words and topic coherence of words.\nThere are some efforts trying to address the limitations of the bag-of-words assumption. For example, in BIBREF27 , both semantic (i.e., related with topics) and syntactic properties of words were modeled. After that, a hidden Markov transition model for topics was proposed BIBREF9 , in which all the words in a sentence were regarded as having the same topic. Such a one sentence, one topic assumption was also used by some other works, including BIBREF10 , BIBREF11 . Although these works have made some meaningful attempts on topic coherence and sequential dependency across sentences, they have not sufficiently model the sequential dependency of words within a sentence. To address this problem, the authors of BIBREF12 adopted the neural language model technology BIBREF13 to enhance topic model. In particular, they assume that every document, sentence, and word have their own topics and the topical information is conveyed by their embedding vectors through a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) as a prior. In the GMM distribution, each topic corresponds to a mixture parameterized by the mean vector and covariance matrix of the Gaussian distribution. The embedding vectors sampled from the GMM are further used to generate words in a sentence according to a feedforward neural network. To be specific, the preceding words in a fixed sized window, together with the sentence and document, act as the context to generate the next word by a softmax conditional distribution, in which the context is represented by embedding vectors. While this work has explicitly modeled the sequential dependency of words, it ignores the topic coherence among adjacent words.\nAnother line of research related to our model is Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), especially some recently developed effective RNN models such as Long Short Term Memory BIBREF17 and Gated Recurrent Unit BIBREF18 . These new RNN models characterize long range dependencies for a sequence, and has been widely adopted in sequence modeling tasks such as machine translation BIBREF18 and short text conversation BIBREF20 . In particular, for language modeling tasks, it has been shown that RNN (and its variants such as LSTM) is much more effective than simple feedforward neural networks with fixed window size BIBREF16 given that it can model dependencies with nearly arbitrary length.\nIn this section, we describe the proposed Sentence Level Recurrent Topic Model (SLRTM). First of all, we list three important design factors in SLRTM as below.\nWith the three points in mind, let us introduce the detailed generative process of SLRTM, as well as the stochastic variational inference and learning algorithm for SLRTM in the following subsections.\nSuppose we have INLINEFORM0 topics, INLINEFORM1 words contained in dictionary INLINEFORM2 , and INLINEFORM3 documents INLINEFORM4 . For any document INLINEFORM5 , it is composed of INLINEFORM6 sentences and its INLINEFORM7 th sentence INLINEFORM8 consists of INLINEFORM9 words. Similar to LDA, we assume there is a INLINEFORM10 -dimensional Dirichlet prior distribution INLINEFORM11 for topic mixture weights of each document. With these notations, the generative process for document INLINEFORM12 can be written as below: \nSample the multinomial parameter INLINEFORM0 from INLINEFORM1 ;\nFor the INLINEFORM0 th sentence of document INLINEFORM1 INLINEFORM2 , INLINEFORM3 , where INLINEFORM4 is the INLINEFORM5 th word for INLINEFORM6 :\nDraw the topic index INLINEFORM0 of this sentence from INLINEFORM1 ;\nFor INLINEFORM0 :\nCompute LSTM hidden state INLINEFORM0 ;\n INLINEFORM0 , draw INLINEFORM1 from DISPLAYFORM0 \nHere we use bold characters to denote the distributed representations for the corresponding items. For example, INLINEFORM0 and INLINEFORM1 denote the embeddings for word INLINEFORM2 and topic INLINEFORM3 , respectively. INLINEFORM4 is a zero vector and INLINEFORM5 is a fake starting word. Function INLINEFORM6 is the LSTM unit to generate hidden states, for which we omit the details due to space restrictions. Function INLINEFORM7 typically takes the following form: DISPLAYFORM0 \nwhere INLINEFORM0 , INLINEFORM1 denotes the output embedding for word INLINEFORM2 . INLINEFORM3 are feedforward weight matrices and INLINEFORM4 is the bias vector.\nThen the probability of observing document INLINEFORM0 can be written as: DISPLAYFORM0 \nwhere INLINEFORM0 is the probability of generating sentence INLINEFORM1 under topic INLINEFORM2 , and it is decomposed through the probability chain rule; INLINEFORM3 is specified in equation ( EQREF11 ) and ( EQREF12 ); INLINEFORM4 represents all the model parameters, including the distributed representations for all the words and topics, as well as the weight parameters for LSTM.\nTo sum up, we use Figure FIGREF14 to illustrate the generative process of SLRTM, from which we can see that in SLRTM, the historical words and topic of the sentence jointly affect the LSTM hidden state and the next word.\nAs the computation of the true posterior of hidden variables in equation ( EQREF13 ) is untractable, we adopt mean field variational inference to approximate it. Particularly, we use multinomial distribution INLINEFORM0 and Dirichlet distribution INLINEFORM1 as the variational distribution for the hidden variables INLINEFORM2 and INLINEFORM3 , and we denote the variational parameters for document INLINEFORM4 as INLINEFORM5 , with the subscript INLINEFORM6 omitted. Then the variational lower bound of the data likelihood BIBREF2 can be written as: DISPLAYFORM0 \nwhere INLINEFORM0 is the true distribution for corresponding variables.\nThe introduction of LSTM-RNN makes the optimization of ( EQREF16 ) computationally expensive, since we need to update both the model parameters INLINEFORM0 and variational parameters INLINEFORM1 after scanning the whole corpus. Considering that mini-batch (containing several sentences) inference and training are necessary to optimize the neural network, we leverage the stochastic variational inference algorithm developed in BIBREF4 , BIBREF28 to conduct inference and learning in a variational Expectation-Maximization framework. The detailed algorithm is given in Algorithm SECREF15 . The execution of the whole inference and learning process includes several epochs of iteration over all documents INLINEFORM2 with Algorithm SECREF15 (starting with INLINEFORM3 ).\n[ht] Stochastic Variational EM for SLRTM Input: document INLINEFORM0 , variation parameters INLINEFORM1 , and model weights INLINEFORM2 . every sentence minibatch INLINEFORM3 in INLINEFORM4 INLINEFORM5 E-Step: INLINEFORM6 INLINEFORM7 , i.e., every topic index: Obtain INLINEFORM8 by LSTM forward pass. INLINEFORM9 DISPLAYFORM0 \n convergence Collect variational parameters INLINEFORM0 . M-Step: Compute the gradient INLINEFORM1 by LSTM backward pass. Use INLINEFORM2 to obtain INLINEFORM3 by stochastic gradient descent methods such as Adagrad BIBREF30 . In Algorithm SECREF15 , INLINEFORM4 is the digamma function. Equation ( EQREF18 ) guarantees the estimate of INLINEFORM5 is unbiased. In equation (), INLINEFORM6 is set as INLINEFORM7 , where INLINEFORM8 , to make sure INLINEFORM9 will converge BIBREF4 . Due to space limit, we omit the derivation details for the updating equations in Algorithm SECREF15 , as well as the forward/backward pass details for LSTM BIBREF17 .\nWe report our experimental results in this section. Our experiments include two parts: (1) quantitative experiments, including a generative document evaluation task and a document classification task, on two datasets; (2) qualitative inspection, including the examination of the sentences generated under each topic, in order to test whether SLRTM performs well in the topic2sentence task.\nWe compare SLRTM with several state-of-the-art topic models on two tasks: generative document evaluation and document classification. The former task is to investigate the generation capability of the models, while the latter is to show the representation ability of the models.\nWe base our experiments on two benchmark datasets:\n20Newsgroup, which contains 18,845 emails categorized into 20 different topical groups such as religion, politics, and sports. The dataset is originally partitioned into 11,314 training documents and 7,531 test documents.\nWiki10+ BIBREF31 , which contains Web documents from Wikipedia, each of which is associated with several tags such as philosophy, software, and music. Following BIBREF25 , we kept the most frequent 25 tags and removed those documents without any of these tags, forming a training set and a test set with 11,164 and 6,161 documents, respectively. The social tags associated with each document are regarded as supervised labels in classification. Wiki10+ contains much more words per document (i.e., 1,704) than 20Newsgroup (i.e., 135).\nWe followed the practice in many previous works and removed infrequent words. After that, the dictionary contains about INLINEFORM0 unique words for 20Newsgroup and INLINEFORM1 for Wiki10+. We adopted the NLTK sentence tokenizer to split the datasets into sentences if sentence boundaries are needed.\nThe following baselines were used in our experiments:\nLDA BIBREF2 . LDA is the classic topic model, and we used GibbsLDA++ for its implementation.\nDoc-NADE BIBREF24 . Doc-NADE is a representative neural network based topic model. We used the open-source code provided by the authors.\nHTMM BIBREF9 . HTMM models consider the sentence level Markov transitions. Similar to Doc-NADE, the implementation was provided by the authors.\nGMNTM BIBREF12 . GMNTM considers models the order of words within a sentence by a feedforward neural network. We implemented GMNTM according the descriptions in their papers by our own.\nFor SLRTM, we implemented it in C++ using Eigen and Intel MKL. For the sake of fairness, similar to BIBREF12 , we set the word embedding size, topic embedding size, and LSTM hidden layer size to be 128, 128, and 600 respectively. In the experiment, we tested the performances of SLRTM and the baselines with respect to different number of topics INLINEFORM0 , i.e., INLINEFORM1 . In initialization (values of INLINEFORM2 and INLINEFORM3 ), the LSTM weight matrices were initialized as orthogonal matrices, the word/topic embeddings were randomly sampled from the uniform distribution INLINEFORM4 and are fined-tuned through the training process, INLINEFORM5 and INLINEFORM6 were both set to INLINEFORM7 . The mini-batch size in Algorithm SECREF15 was set as INLINEFORM8 , and we ran the E-Step of the algorithm for only one iteration for efficiently consideration, which leads to the final convergence after about 6 epochs for both datasets. Gradient clipping with a clip value of 20 was used during the optimization of LSTM weights. Asynchronous stochastic gradient descent BIBREF32 with Adagrad was used to perform multi-thread parallel training.\nWe measure the performances of different topic models according to the perplexity per word on the test set, defined as INLINEFORM0 , where INLINEFORM1 is the number of words in document INLINEFORM2 . The experimental results are summarized in Table TABREF33 . Based on the table, we have the following discussions:\nOur proposed SLRTM consistently outperforms the baseline models by significant margins, showing its outstanding ability in modelling the generative process of documents. In fact, as tested in our further verifications, the perplexity of SLRTM is close to that of standard LSTM language model, with a small gap of about 100 (higher perplexity) on both datasets which we conjecture is due to the margin between the lower bound in equation ( EQREF16 ) and true data likelihood for SLRTM.\nModels that consider sequential property within sentences (i.e., GMNTM and SLRTM) are generally better than other models, which verifies the importance of words' sequential information. Furthermore, LSTM-RNN is much better in modelling such a sequential dependency than standard feed-forward networks with fixed words window as input, as verified by the lower perplexity of SLRTM compared with GMNTM.\nIn this experiment, we fed the document vectors (e.g., the INLINEFORM0 values in SLRTM) learnt by different topic models to supervised classifiers, to compare their representation power. For 20Newsgroup, we used the multi-class logistic regression classifier and used accuracy as the evaluation criterion. For Wiki10+, since multiple labels (tags) might be associated with each document, we used logistic regression for each label and the classification result is measured by Micro- INLINEFORM1 score BIBREF33 . For both datasets, we use INLINEFORM2 of the original training set for validation, and the remaining for training.\nAll the classification results are shown in Table TABREF37 . From the table, we can see that SLRTM is the best model under each setting on both datasets. We can further find that the embedding based methods (Doc-NADE, GMNTM and SLRTM) generate better document representations than other models, demonstrating the representative power of neural networks based on distributed representations. In addition, when the training data is larger (i.e., with more sentences per document as Wiki10+), GMNTM generates worse topical information than Doc-NADE while our SLRTM outperforms Doc-NADE, showing that with sufficient data, SLRTM is more effective in topic modeling since topic coherence is further constrained for each sentence.\nIn this subsection, we demonstrate the capability of SLRTM in generating reasonable and understandable sentences given particular topics. In the experiment, we trained a larger SLRTM with 128 topics on a randomly sampled INLINEFORM0 Wikipedia documents in the year of 2010 with average 275 words per document. The dictionary is composed of roughly INLINEFORM1 most frequent words including common punctuation marks, with uppercase letters transformed into lowercases. The size of word embedding, topic embedding and RNN hidden layer are set to 512, 1024 and 1024, respectively.\nWe used two different mechanisms in sentence generating. The first mechanism is random sampling new word INLINEFORM0 at every time step INLINEFORM1 from the probability distribution defined in equation ( EQREF13 ). The second is dynamic programming based beam search BIBREF19 , which seeks to generate sentences by globally maximized likelihood. We set the beam size as 30. The generating process terminates until a predefined maximum sentence length is reached (set as 25) or an EOS token is met. Such an EOS is also appended after every training sentence.\nThe generating results are shown in Table TABREF40 . In the table, the sentences generated by random sampling and beam search are shown in the second and the third columns respectively. In the fourth column, we show the most representative words for each topics generated by SLRTM. For this purpose, we constrained the maximum sentence length to 1 in beam search, and removed stop words that are frequently used to start a sentence such as the, he, and there.\nFrom the table we have the following observations:\nMost of the sentences generated by both mechanisms are natural and semantically correlated with particular topics that are summarized in the first column of the table.\nThe random sampling mechanism usually produces diverse sentences, whereas some grammar errors may happen (e.g., the last sampled sentence for Topic 4; re-ranking the randomly sampled words by a standalone language model might further improve the correctness of the sentence). In contrast, sentences outputted by beam search are safer in matching grammar rules, but are not diverse enough. This is consistent with the observations in BIBREF21 .\nIn addition to topic2sentece, SLRTM maintains the capability of generating words for topics (shown in the last column of the table), similar to conventional topic models.\nIn this paper, we proposed a novel topic model called Sentence Level Recurrent Topic Model (SLRTM), which models the sequential dependency of words and topic coherence within a sentence using Recurrent Neural Networks, and shows superior performance in both predictive document modeling and document classification. In addition, it makes topic2sentence possible, which can benefit many real world tasks such as personalized short text conversation (STC).\nIn the future, we plan to integrate SLRTM into RNN-based STC systems BIBREF20 to make the dialogue more topic sensitive. We would also like to conduct large scale SLRTM training on bigger corpus with more topics by specially designed scalable algorithms and computational platforms.", "question": "What baselines did they compare with?", "expected_output": "LDA.

In addition, they model the sequential information by assuming the transition between sentence topics to be Markovian. However, words within the same sentence are still exchangeable in these models, and thus the bag-of-words assumption still holds within a sentence. For another example, in BIBREF12 , the embedding based neural language model BIBREF13 , BIBREF14 , BIBREF15 and topic model are integrated. They assume the generation of a given word in a sentence to depend on its local context (including its preceding words within a fixed window) as well as the topics of the sentence and document it lies in. However, using a fixed window of preceding words, instead of the whole word stream within a sentence, could only introduce limited sequential dependency. Furthermore, there is no explicit coherence constraints on the word topics and sentence topics, since every word can have its own topics in their model.\nWe propose Sentence Level Recurrent Topic Model (SLRTM) to tackle the limitations of the aforementioned works. In the new model, we assume the words in the same sentence to share the same topic in order to guarantee topic coherence, and we assume the generation of a word to rely on the whole history in the same sentence in order to fully characterize the sequential dependency.

Topic2sentence has its huge potential for many real world tasks. For example, it can serve as the basis of personalized short text conversation system BIBREF20 , BIBREF21 , in which once we detect that the user is interested in certain topics, we can let these topics speak for themselves using SLRTM to improve the user satisfactory.\nWe have conducted experiments to compare SLRTM with several strong topic model baselines on two tasks: generative model evaluation (i.e. test set perplexity) and document classification.

For example, in BIBREF27 , both semantic (i.e., related with topics) and syntactic properties of words were modeled. After that, a hidden Markov transition model for topics was proposed BIBREF9 , in which all the words in a sentence were regarded as having the same topic. Such a one sentence, one topic assumption was also used by some other works, including BIBREF10 , BIBREF11 .

For any document INLINEFORM5 , it is composed of INLINEFORM6 sentences and its INLINEFORM7 th sentence INLINEFORM8 consists of INLINEFORM9 words. Similar to LDA, we assume there is a INLINEFORM10 -dimensional Dirichlet prior distribution INLINEFORM11 for topic mixture weights of each document. With these notations, the generative process for document INLINEFORM12 can be written as below: \nSample the multinomial parameter INLINEFORM0 from INLINEFORM1 ;\nFor the INLINEFORM0 th sentence of document INLINEFORM1 INLINEFORM2 , INLINEFORM3 , where INLINEFORM4 is the INLINEFORM5 th word for INLINEFORM6 :\nDraw the topic index INLINEFORM0 of this sentence from INLINEFORM1 ;\nFor INLINEFORM0 :\nCompute LSTM hidden state INLINEFORM0 ;\n INLINEFORM0 , draw INLINEFORM1 from DISPLAYFORM0 \nHere we use bold characters to denote the distributed representations for the corresponding items. For example, INLINEFORM0 and INLINEFORM1 denote the embeddings for word INLINEFORM2 and topic INLINEFORM3 , respectively. INLINEFORM4 is a zero vector and INLINEFORM5 is a fake starting word. Function INLINEFORM6 is the LSTM unit to generate hidden states, for which we omit the details due to space restrictions. Function INLINEFORM7 typically takes the following form: DISPLAYFORM0 \nwhere INLINEFORM0 , INLINEFORM1 denotes the output embedding for word INLINEFORM2 . INLINEFORM3 are feedforward weight matrices and INLINEFORM4 is the bias vector.\nThen the probability of observing document INLINEFORM0 can be written as: DISPLAYFORM0 \nwhere INLINEFORM0 is the probability of generating sentence INLINEFORM1 under topic INLINEFORM2 , and it is decomposed through the probability chain rule; INLINEFORM3 is specified in equation ( EQREF11 ) and ( EQREF12 ); INLINEFORM4 represents all the model parameters, including the distributed representations for all the words and topics, as well as the weight parameters for LSTM.\nTo sum up, we use Figure FIGREF14 to illustrate the generative process of SLRTM, from which we can see that in SLRTM, the historical words and topic of the sentence jointly affect the LSTM hidden state and the next word.\nAs the computation of the true posterior of hidden variables in equation ( EQREF13 ) is untractable, we adopt mean field variational inference to approximate it. Particularly, we use multinomial distribution INLINEFORM0 and Dirichlet distribution INLINEFORM1 as the variational distribution for the hidden variables INLINEFORM2 and INLINEFORM3 , and we denote the variational parameters for document INLINEFORM4 as INLINEFORM5 , with the subscript INLINEFORM6 omitted. Then the variational lower bound of the data likelihood BIBREF2 can be written as: DISPLAYFORM0 \nwhere INLINEFORM0 is the true distribution for corresponding variables.\nThe introduction of LSTM-RNN makes the optimization of ( EQREF16 ) computationally expensive, since we need to update both the model parameters INLINEFORM0 and variational parameters INLINEFORM1 after scanning the whole corpus. Considering that mini-batch (containing several sentences) inference and training are necessary to optimize the neural network, we leverage the stochastic variational inference algorithm developed in BIBREF4 , BIBREF28 to conduct inference and learning in a variational Expectation-Maximization framework. The detailed algorithm is given in Algorithm SECREF15 . The execution of the whole inference and learning process includes several epochs of iteration over all documents INLINEFORM2 with Algorithm SECREF15 (starting with INLINEFORM3 ).\n[ht] Stochastic Variational EM for SLRTM Input: document INLINEFORM0 , variation parameters INLINEFORM1 , and model weights INLINEFORM2 . every sentence minibatch INLINEFORM3 in INLINEFORM4 INLINEFORM5 E-Step: INLINEFORM6 INLINEFORM7 , i.e., every topic index: Obtain INLINEFORM8 by LSTM forward pass.

Use INLINEFORM2 to obtain INLINEFORM3 by stochastic gradient descent methods such as Adagrad BIBREF30 . In Algorithm SECREF15 , INLINEFORM4 is the digamma function. Equation ( EQREF18 ) guarantees the estimate of INLINEFORM5 is unbiased. In equation (), INLINEFORM6 is set as INLINEFORM7 , where INLINEFORM8 , to make sure INLINEFORM9 will converge BIBREF4 . Due to space limit, we omit the derivation details for the updating equations in Algorithm SECREF15 , as well as the forward/backward pass details for LSTM BIBREF17 .\nWe report our experimental results in this section. Our experiments include two parts: (1) quantitative experiments, including a generative document evaluation task and a document classification task, on two datasets; (2) qualitative inspection, including the examination of the sentences generated under each topic, in order to test whether SLRTM performs well in the topic2sentence task.\nWe compare SLRTM with several state-of-the-art topic models on two tasks: generative document evaluation and document classification. The former task is to investigate the generation capability of the models, while the latter is to show the representation ability of the models.\nWe base our experiments on two benchmark datasets:\n20Newsgroup, which contains 18,845 emails categorized into 20 different topical groups such as religion, politics, and sports. The dataset is originally partitioned into 11,314 training documents and 7,531 test documents.\nWiki10+ BIBREF31 , which contains Web documents from Wikipedia, each of which is associated with several tags such as philosophy, software, and music. Following BIBREF25 , we kept the most frequent 25 tags and removed those documents without any of these tags, forming a training set and a test set with 11,164 and 6,161 documents, respectively. The social tags associated with each document are regarded as supervised labels in classification. Wiki10+ contains much more words per document (i.e., 1,704) than 20Newsgroup (i.e., 135).\nWe followed the practice in many previous works and removed infrequent words. After that, the dictionary contains about INLINEFORM0 unique words for 20Newsgroup and INLINEFORM1 for Wiki10+. We adopted the NLTK sentence tokenizer to split the datasets into sentences if sentence boundaries are needed.\nThe following baselines were used in our experiments:\nLDA BIBREF2 . LDA is the classic topic model, and we used GibbsLDA++ for its implementation.\nDoc-NADE BIBREF24 . Doc-NADE is a representative neural network based topic model. We used the open-source code provided by the authors.\nHTMM BIBREF9 . HTMM models consider the sentence level Markov transitions. Similar to Doc-NADE, the implementation was provided by the authors.\nGMNTM BIBREF12 . GMNTM considers models the order of words within a sentence by a feedforward neural network. We implemented GMNTM according the descriptions in their papers by our own.\nFor SLRTM, we implemented it in C++ using Eigen and Intel MKL. For the sake of fairness, similar to BIBREF12 , we set the word embedding size, topic embedding size, and LSTM hidden layer size to be 128, 128, and 600 respectively. In the experiment, we tested the performances of SLRTM and the baselines with respect to different number of topics INLINEFORM0 , i.e., INLINEFORM1 . In initialization (values of INLINEFORM2 and INLINEFORM3 ), the LSTM weight matrices were initialized as orthogonal matrices, the word/topic embeddings were randomly sampled from the uniform distribution INLINEFORM4 and are fined-tuned through the training process, INLINEFORM5 and INLINEFORM6 were both set to INLINEFORM7 . The mini-batch size in Algorithm SECREF15 was set as INLINEFORM8 , and we ran the E-Step of the algorithm for only one iteration for efficiently consideration, which leads to the final convergence after about 6 epochs for both datasets. Gradient clipping with a clip value of 20 was used during the optimization of LSTM weights. Asynchronous stochastic gradient descent BIBREF32 with Adagrad was used to perform multi-thread parallel training.\nWe measure the performances of different topic models according to the perplexity per word on the test set, defined as INLINEFORM0 , where INLINEFORM1 is the number of words in document INLINEFORM2 . The experimental results are summarized in Table TABREF33 . Based on the table, we have the following discussions:\nOur proposed SLRTM consistently outperforms the baseline models by significant margins, showing its outstanding ability in modelling the generative process of documents. In fact, as tested in our further verifications, the perplexity of SLRTM is close to that of standard LSTM language model, with a small gap of about 100 (higher perplexity) on both datasets which we conjecture is due to the margin between the lower bound in equation ( EQREF16 ) and true data likelihood for SLRTM.\nModels that consider sequential property within sentences (i.e., GMNTM and SLRTM) are generally better than other models, which verifies the importance of words' sequential information. Furthermore, LSTM-RNN is much better in modelling such a sequential dependency than standard feed-forward networks with fixed words window as input, as verified by the lower perplexity of SLRTM compared with GMNTM.\nIn this experiment, we fed the document vectors (e.g., the INLINEFORM0 values in SLRTM) learnt by different topic models to supervised classifiers, to compare their representation power. For 20Newsgroup, we used the multi-class logistic regression classifier and used accuracy as the evaluation criterion. For Wiki10+, since multiple labels (tags) might be associated with each document, we used logistic regression for each label and the classification result is measured by Micro- INLINEFORM1 score BIBREF33 . For both datasets, we use INLINEFORM2 of the original training set for validation, and the remaining for training.\nAll the classification results are shown in Table TABREF37 . From the table, we can see that SLRTM is the best model under each setting on both datasets. We can further find that the embedding based methods (Doc-NADE, GMNTM and SLRTM) generate better document representations than other models, demonstrating the representative power of neural networks based on distributed representations. In addition, when the training data is larger (i.e., with more sentences per document as Wiki10+), GMNTM generates worse topical information than Doc-NADE while our SLRTM outperforms Doc-NADE, showing that with sufficient data, SLRTM is more effective in topic modeling since topic coherence is further constrained for each sentence.\nIn this subsection, we demonstrate the capability of SLRTM in generating reasonable and understandable sentences given particular topics. In the experiment, we trained a larger SLRTM with 128 topics on a randomly sampled INLINEFORM0 Wikipedia documents in the year of 2010 with average 275 words per document. The dictionary is composed of roughly INLINEFORM1 most frequent words including common punctuation marks, with uppercase letters transformed into lowercases. The size of word embedding, topic embedding and RNN hidden layer are set to 512, 1024 and 1024, respectively.\nWe used two different mechanisms in sentence generating. The first mechanism is random sampling new word INLINEFORM0 at every time step INLINEFORM1 from the probability distribution defined in equation ( EQREF13 ). The second is dynamic programming based beam search BIBREF19 , which seeks to generate sentences by globally maximized likelihood. We set the beam size as 30. The generating process terminates until a predefined maximum sentence length is reached (set as 25) or an EOS token is met. Such an EOS is also appended after every training sentence.\nThe generating results are shown in Table TABREF40 . In the table, the sentences generated by random sampling and beam search are shown in the second and the third columns respectively. In the fourth column, we show the most representative words for each topics generated by SLRTM. For this purpose, we constrained the maximum sentence length to 1 in beam search, and removed stop words that are frequently used to start a sentence such as the, he, and there.\nFrom the table we have the following observations:\nMost of the sentences generated by both mechanisms are natural and semantically correlated with particular topics that are summarized in the first column of the table.\nThe random sampling mechanism usually produces diverse sentences, whereas some grammar errors may happen (e.g., the last sampled sentence for Topic 4; re-ranking the randomly sampled words by a standalone language model might further improve the correctness of the sentence). In contrast, sentences outputted by beam search are safer in matching grammar rules, but are not diverse enough. This is consistent with the observations in BIBREF21 .\nIn addition to topic2sentece, SLRTM maintains the capability of generating words for topics (shown in the last column of the table), similar to conventional topic models.\nIn this paper, we proposed a novel topic model called Sentence Level Recurrent Topic Model (SLRTM), which models the sequential dependency of words and topic coherence within a sentence using Recurrent Neural Networks, and shows superior performance in both predictive document modeling and document classification. In addition, it makes topic2sentence possible, which can benefit many real world tasks such as personalized short text conversation (STC).\nIn the future, we plan to integrate SLRTM into RNN-based STC systems BIBREF20 to make the dialogue more topic sensitive. We would also like to conduct large scale SLRTM training on bigger corpus with more topics by specially designed scalable algorithms and computational platforms.", "question": "Which tasks are explored in this paper?", "expected_output": "generative model evaluation (i.e. test set perplexity) and document classification.

{"id": "1911.04474", "prompt": "The named entity recognition (NER) is the task of finding the start and end of an entity in a sentence and assigning a class for this entity. NER has been widely studied in the field of natural language processing (NLP) because of its potential assistance in question generation BIBREF0, relation extraction BIBREF1, and coreference resolution BIBREF2. Since BIBREF3, various neural models have been introduced to avoid hand-crafted features BIBREF4, BIBREF5, BIBREF6.\nNER is usually viewed as a sequence labeling task, the neural models usually contain three components: word embedding layer, context encoder layer, and decoder layer BIBREF4, BIBREF5, BIBREF6, BIBREF7, BIBREF8, BIBREF9, BIBREF10. The difference between various NER models mainly lies in the variance in these components.\nRecurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are widely employed in NLP tasks due to its sequential characteristic, which is aligned well with language. Specifically, bidirectional long short-term memory networks (BiLSTM) BIBREF11 is one of the most widely used RNN structures. BIBREF4 was the first one to apply the BiLSTM and Conditional Random Fields (CRF) BIBREF12 to sequence labeling tasks. Owing to BiLSTM's high power to learn the contextual representation of words, it has been adopted by the majority of NER models as the encoder BIBREF5, BIBREF6, BIBREF9, BIBREF10.\nRecently, Transformer BIBREF13 began to prevail in various NLP tasks, like machine translation BIBREF13, language modeling BIBREF14, and pretraining models BIBREF15. The Transformer encoder adopts a fully-connected self-attention structure to model the long-range context, which is the weakness of RNNs. Moreover, Transformer has better parallelism ability than RNNs. However, in the NER task, Transformer encoder has been reported to perform poorly BIBREF16, our experiments also confirm this result. Therefore, it is intriguing to explore the reason why Transformer does not work well in NER task.\nIn this paper, we analyze the properties of Transformer and propose two specific improvements for NER.\nThe first is that the sinusoidal position embedding used in the vanilla Transformer is aware of distance but unaware of the directionality. In addition, this property will lose when used in the vanilla Transformer. However, both the direction and distance information are important in the NER task. For example in Fig FIGREF3, words after \u201cin\" are more likely to be a location or time than words before it, and words before \u201cInc.\" are mostly likely to be of the entity type \u201cORG\". Besides, an entity is a continuous span of words. Therefore, the awareness of distance might help the word better recognizes its neighbor. To endow the Transformer with the ability of direction- and distance-awareness, we adopt the relative positional encoding BIBREF17, BIBREF18, BIBREF19. instead of the absolute position encoding. We propose a revised relative positional encoding that uses fewer parameters and performs better.\nThe second is an empirical finding. The attention distribution of the vanilla Transformer is scaled and smooth. But for NER, a sparse attention is suitable since not all words are necessary to be attended. Given a current word, a few contextual words are enough to judge its label. The smooth attention could include some noisy information. Therefore, we abandon the scale factor of dot-production attention and use an un-scaled and sharp attention.\nWith the above improvements, we can greatly boost the performance of Transformer encoder for NER.\nOther than only using Transformer to model the word-level context, we also tried to apply it as a character encoder to model word representation with character-level information. The previous work has proved that character encoder is necessary to capture the character-level features and alleviate the out-of-vocabulary (OOV) problem BIBREF6, BIBREF5, BIBREF7, BIBREF20. In NER, CNN is commonly used as the character encoder. However, we argue that CNN is also not perfect for representing character-level information, because the receptive field of CNN is limited, and the kernel size of the CNN character encoder is usually 3, which means it cannot correctly recognize 2-gram or 4-gram patterns. Although we can deliberately design different kernels, CNN still cannot solve patterns with discontinuous characters, such as \u201cun..ily\u201d in \u201cunhappily\" and \u201cunnecessarily\". Instead, the Transformer-based character encoder shall not only fully make use of the concurrence power of GPUs, but also have the potentiality to recognize different n-grams and even discontinuous patterns. Therefore, in this paper, we also try to use Transformer as the character encoder, and we compare four kinds of character encoders.\nIn summary, to improve the performance of the Transformer-based model in the NER task, we explicitly utilize the directional relative positional encoding, reduce the number of parameters and sharp the attention distribution. After the adaptation, the performance raises a lot, making our model even performs better than BiLSTM based models. Furthermore, in the six NER datasets, we achieve state-of-the-art performance among models without considering the pre-trained language models or designed features.\nBIBREF3 utilized the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and CNN to avoid using task-specific features to tackle different sequence labeling tasks, such as Chunking, Part-of-Speech (POS) and NER. In BIBREF4, BiLSTM-CRF was introduced to solve sequence labeling questions. Since then, the BiLSTM has been extensively used in the field of NER BIBREF7, BIBREF21, BIBREF22, BIBREF5.\nDespite BiLSTM's great success in the NER task, it has to compute token representations one by one, which massively hinders full exploitation of GPU's parallelism. Therefore, CNN has been proposed by BIBREF23, BIBREF24 to encode words concurrently. In order to enlarge the receptive field of CNNs, BIBREF23 used iterative dilated CNNs (ID-CNN).\nSince the word shape information, such as the capitalization and n-gram, is important in recognizing named entities, CNN and BiLSTM have been used to extract character-level information BIBREF7, BIBREF6, BIBREF5, BIBREF23, BIBREF8.\nAlmost all neural-based NER models used pre-trained word embeddings, like Word2vec and Glove BIBREF25, BIBREF26. And when contextual word embeddings are combined, the performance of NER models will boost a lot BIBREF27, BIBREF28, BIBREF29. ELMo introduced by BIBREF28 used the CNN character encoder and BiLSTM language models to get contextualized word representations. Except for the BiLSTM based pre-trained models, BERT was based on Transformer BIBREF15.\nTransformer was introduced by BIBREF13, which was mainly based on self-attention. It achieved great success in various NLP tasks. Since the self-attention mechanism used in the Transformer is unaware of positions, to avoid this shortage, position embeddings were used BIBREF13, BIBREF15. Instead of using the sinusoidal position embedding BIBREF13 and learned absolute position embedding, BIBREF17 argued that the distance between two tokens should be considered when calculating their attention score. BIBREF18 reduced the computation complexity of relative positional encoding from $O(l^2d)$ to $O(ld)$, where $l$ is the length of sequences and $d$ is the hidden size. BIBREF19 derived a new form of relative positional encodings, so that the relative relation could be better considered.\nWe first introduce the Transformer encoder proposed in BIBREF13. The Transformer encoder takes in an matrix $H \\in \\mathbb {R}^{l \\times d}$, where $l$ is the sequence length, $d$ is the input dimension. Then three learnable matrix $W_q$, $W_k$, $W_v$ are used to project $H$ into different spaces. Usually, the matrix size of the three matrix are all $\\mathbb {R}^{d \\times d_k}$, where $d_k$ is a hyper-parameter. After that, the scaled dot-product attention can be calculated by the following equations,\nwhere $Q_t$ is the query vector of the $t$th token, $j$ is the token the $t$th token attends. $K_j$ is the key vector representation of the $j$th token. The softmax is along the last dimension. Instead of using one group of $W_q$, $W_k$, $W_v$, using several groups will enhance the ability of self-attention. When several groups are used, it is called multi-head self-attention, the calculation can be formulated as follows,\nwhere $n$ is the number of heads, the superscript $h$ represents the head index. $[head^{(1)}; ...; head^{(n)}]$ means concatenation in the last dimension. Usually $d_k \\times n = d$, which means the output of $[head^{(1)}; ...; head^{(n)}]$ will be of size $\\mathbb {R}^{l \\times d}$. $W_o$ is a learnable parameter, which is of size $\\mathbb {R}^{d \\times d}$.\nThe output of the multi-head attention will be further processed by the position-wise feed-forward networks, which can be represented as follows,\nwhere $W_1$, $W_2$, $b_1$, $b_2$ are learnable parameters, and $W_1 \\in \\mathbb {R}^{d \\times d_{ff}}$, $W_2 \\in \\mathbb {R}^{d_{ff} \\times d}$, $b_1 \\in \\mathbb {R}^{d_{ff}}$, $b_2 \\in \\mathbb {R}^{d}$. $d_{ff}$ is a hyper-parameter. Other components of the Transformer encoder includes layer normalization and Residual connection, we use them the same as BIBREF13.\nThe self-attention is not aware of the positions of different tokens, making it unable to capture the sequential characteristic of languages. In order to solve this problem, BIBREF13 suggested to use position embeddings generated by sinusoids of varying frequency. The $t$th token's position embedding can be represented by the following equations\nwhere $i$ is in the range of $[0, \\frac{d}{2}]$, $d$ is the input dimension. This sinusoid based position embedding makes Transformer have an ability to model the position of a token and the distance of each two tokens. For any fixed offset $k$, $PE_{t+k}$ can be represented by a linear transformation of $PE_{t}$ BIBREF13.\nIn this paper, we utilize the Transformer encoder to model the long-range and complicated interactions of sentence for NER. The structure of proposed model is shown in Fig FIGREF12. We detail each parts in the following sections.\nTo alleviate the problems of data sparsity and out-of-vocabulary (OOV), most NER models adopted the CNN character encoder BIBREF5, BIBREF30, BIBREF8 to represent words. Compared to BiLSTM based character encoder BIBREF6, BIBREF31, CNN is more efficient. Since Transformer can also fully exploit the GPU's parallelism, it is interesting to use Transformer as the character encoder. A potential benefit of Transformer-based character encoder is to extract different n-grams and even uncontinuous character patterns, like \u201cun..ily\u201d in \u201cunhappily\u201d and \u201cuneasily\u201d. For the model's uniformity, we use the \u201cadapted Transformer\u201d to represent the Transformer introduced in next subsection.\nThe final word embedding is the concatenation of the character features extracted by the character encoder and the pre-trained word embeddings.\nAlthough Transformer encoder has potential advantage in modeling long-range context, it is not working well for NER task. In this paper, we propose an adapted Transformer for NER task with two improvements.\nInspired by the success of BiLSTM in NER tasks, we consider what properties the Transformer lacks compared to BiLSTM-based models. One observation is that BiLSTM can discriminatively collect the context information of a token from its left and right sides. But it is not easy for the Transformer to distinguish which side the context information comes from.\nAlthough the dot product between two sinusoidal position embeddings is able to reflect their distance, it lacks directionality and this property will be broken by the vanilla Transformer attention. To illustrate this, we first prove two properties of the sinusoidal position embeddings.\nProperty 1 For an offset $k$ and a position $t$, $PE_{t+k}^TPE_{t}$ only depends on $k$, which means the dot product of two sinusoidal position embeddings can reflect the distance between two tokens.\nBased on the definitions of Eq.(DISPLAY_FORM11) and Eq.(), the position embedding of $t$-th token is PEt = [ c (c0t)\n(c0t)\n$\\vdots $\n(cd2-1t)\n(cd2-1t)\n], where $d$ is the dimension of the position embedding, $c_i$ is a constant decided by $i$, and its value is $1/10000^{2i/d}$.\nTherefore,\nwhere Eq.(DISPLAY_FORM17) to Eq.() is based on the equation $\\cos (x-y) = \\sin (x)\\sin (y) + \\cos (x)\\cos (y)$.\nProperty 2 For an offset $k$ and a position $t$, $PE_{t}^TPE_{t-k}=PE_{t}^TPE_{t+k}$, which means the sinusoidal position embeddings is unware of directionality.\nLet $j=t-k$, according to property 1, we have\nThe relation between $d$, $k$ and $PE_t^TPE_{t+k}$ is displayed in Fig FIGREF18. The sinusoidal position embeddings are distance-aware but lacks directionality.\nHowever, the property of distance-awareness also disappears when $PE_t$ is projected into the query and key space of self-attention. Since in vanilla Transformer the calculation between $PE_t$ and $PE_{t+k}$ is actually $PE_t^TW_q^TW_kPE_{t+k}$, where $W_q, W_k$ are parameters in Eq.(DISPLAY_FORM7). Mathematically, it can be viewed as $PE_t^TWPE_{t+k}$ with only one parameter $W$. The relation between $PE_t^TPE_{t+k}$ and $PE_t^TWPE_{t+k}$ is depicted in Fig FIGREF19.\nTherefore, to improve the Transformer with direction- and distance-aware characteristic, we calculate the attention scores using the equations below:\nwhere $t$ is index of the target token, $j$ is the index of the context token, $Q_t, K_j$ is the query vector and key vector of token $t, j$ respectively, $W_q, W_v \\in \\mathbb {R}^{d \\times d_k}$. To get $H_{d_k}\\in \\mathbb {R}^{l \\times d_k}$, we first split $H$ into $d/d_k$ partitions in the second dimension, then for each head we use one partition. $\\mathbf {u} \\in \\mathbb {R}^{d_k}$, $\\mathbf {v} \\in \\mathbb {R}^{d_k}$ are learnable parameters, $R_{t-j}$ is the relative positional encoding, and $R_{t-j} \\in \\mathbb {R}^{d_k}$, $i$ in Eq.() is in the range $[0, \\frac{d_k}{2}]$. $Q_t^TK_j$ in Eq.() is the attention score between two tokens; $Q_t^TR_{t-j}$ is the $t$th token's bias on certain relative distance; $u^TK_j$ is the bias on the $j$th token; $v^TR_{t-j}$ is the bias term for certain distance and direction.\nBased on Eq.(), we have\nbecause $\\sin (-x)=-\\sin (x), \\cos (x)=\\cos (-x)$. This means for an offset $t$, the forward and backward relative positional encoding are the same with respect to the $\\cos (c_it)$ terms, but is the opposite with respect to the $\\sin (c_it)$ terms. Therefore, by using $R_{t-j}$, the attention score can distinguish different directions and distances.\nThe above improvement is based on the work BIBREF17, BIBREF19. Since the size of NER datasets is usually small, we avoid direct multiplication of two learnable parameters, because they can be represented by one learnable parameter. Therefore we do not use $W_k$ in Eq.(DISPLAY_FORM22). The multi-head version is the same as Eq.(DISPLAY_FORM8), but we discard $W_o$ since it is directly multiplied by $W_1$ in Eq.(DISPLAY_FORM9).\nThe vanilla Transformer use the scaled dot-product attention to smooth the output of softmax function. In Eq.(), the dot product of key and value matrices is divided by the scaling factor $\\sqrt{d_k}$.\nWe empirically found that models perform better without the scaling factor $\\sqrt{d_k}$. We presume this is because without the scaling factor the attention will be sharper. And the sharper attention might be beneficial in the NER task since only few words in the sentence are named entities.\nIn order to take advantage of dependency between different tags, the Conditional Random Field (CRF) was used in all of our models. Given a sequence $\\mathbf {s}=[s_1, s_2, ..., s_T]$, the corresponding golden label sequence is $\\mathbf {y}=[y_1, y_2, ..., y_T]$, and $\\mathbf {Y}(\\mathbf {s})$ represents all valid label sequences. The probability of $\\mathbf {y}$ is calculated by the following equation\nwhere $f(\\mathbf {y}_{t-1},\\mathbf {y}_t,\\mathbf {s})$ computes the transition score from $\\mathbf {y}_{t-1}$ to $\\mathbf {y}_t$ and the score for $\\mathbf {y}_t$. The optimization target is to maximize $P(\\mathbf {y}|\\mathbf {s})$. When decoding, the Viterbi Algorithm is used to find the path achieves the maximum probability.\nWe evaluate our model in two English NER datasets and four Chinese NER datasets.\n(1) CoNLL2003 is one of the most evaluated English NER datasets, which contains four different named entities: PERSON, LOCATION, ORGANIZATION, and MISC BIBREF34.\n(2) OntoNotes 5.0 is an English NER dataset whose corpus comes from different domains, such as telephone conversation, newswire. We exclude the New Testaments portion since there is no named entity in it BIBREF8, BIBREF7. This dataset has eleven entity names and seven value types, like CARDINAL, MONEY, LOC.\n(3) BIBREF35 released OntoNotes 4.0. In this paper, we use the Chinese part. We adopted the same pre-process as BIBREF36.\n(4) The corpus of the Chinese NER dataset MSRA came from news domain BIBREF37.\n(5) Weibo NER was built based on text in Chinese social media Sina Weibo BIBREF38, and it contained 4 kinds of entities.\n(6) Resume NER was annotated by BIBREF33.\nTheir statistics are listed in Table TABREF28. For all datasets, we replace all digits with \u201c0\u201d, and use the BIOES tag schema. For English, we use the Glove 100d pre-trained embedding BIBREF25. For the character encoder, we use 30d randomly initialized character embeddings. More details on models' hyper-parameters can be found in the supplementary material. For Chinese, we used the character embedding and bigram embedding released by BIBREF33. All pre-trained embeddings are finetuned during training. In order to reduce the impact of randomness, we ran all of our experiments at least three times, and its average F1 score and standard deviation are reported.\nWe used random-search to find the optimal hyper-parameters, hyper-parameters and their ranges are displayed in the supplemental material. We use SGD and 0.9 momentum to optimize the model. We run 100 epochs and each batch has 16 samples. During the optimization, we use the triangle learning rate BIBREF39 where the learning rate rises to the pre-set learning rate at the first 1% steps and decreases to 0 in the left 99% steps. The model achieves the highest development performance was used to evaluate the test set. The hyper-parameter search range and other settings can be found in the supplementary material. Codes are available at https://github.com/fastnlp/TENER.\nWe first present our results in the four Chinese NER datasets. Since Chinese NER is directly based on the characters, it is more straightforward to show the abilities of different models without considering the influence of word representation.\nAs shown in Table TABREF29, the vanilla Transformer does not perform well and is worse than the BiLSTM and CNN based models. However, when relative positional encoding combined, the performance was enhanced greatly, resulting in better results than the BiLSTM and CNN in all datasets. The number of training examples of the Weibo dataset is tiny, therefore the performance of the Transformer is abysmal, which is as expected since the Transformer is data-hungry. Nevertheless, when enhanced with the relative positional encoding and unscaled attention, it can achieve even better performance than the BiLSTM-based model. The superior performance of the adapted Transformer in four datasets ranging from small datasets to big datasets depicts that the adapted Transformer is more robust to the number of training examples than the vanilla Transformer. As the last line of Table TABREF29 depicts, the scaled attention will deteriorate the performance.\nThe comparison between different NER models on English NER datasets is shown in Table TABREF32. The poor performance of the Transformer in the NER datasets was also reported by BIBREF16. Although performance of the Transformer is higher than BIBREF16, it still lags behind the BiLSTM-based models BIBREF5. Nonetheless, the performance is massively enhanced by incorporating the relative positional encoding and unscaled attention into the Transformer. The adaptation not only makes the Transformer achieve superior performance than BiLSTM based models, but also unveil the new state-of-the-art performance in two NER datasets when only the Glove 100d embedding and CNN character embedding are used. The same deterioration of performance was observed when using the scaled attention. Besides, if ELMo was used BIBREF28, the performance of TENER can be further boosted as depicted in Table TABREF33.\nThe character-level encoder has been widely used in the English NER task to alleviate the data sparsity and OOV problem in word representation. In this section, we cross different character-level encoders (BiLSTM, CNN, Transformer encoder and our adapted Transformer encoder (AdaTrans for short) ) and different word-level encoders (BiLSTM, ID-CNN and AdaTrans) to implement the NER task. Results on CoNLL2003 and OntoNotes 5.0 are presented in Table TABREF34 and Table TABREF34, respectively.\nThe ID-CNN encoder is from BIBREF23, and we re-implement their model in PyTorch. For different combinations, we use random search to find its best hyper-parameters. Hyper-parameters for character encoders were fixed. The details can be found in the supplementary material.\nFor the results on CoNLL2003 dataset which is depicted in Table TABREF34, the AdaTrans performs as good as the BiLSTM in different character encoder scenario averagely. In addition, from Table TABREF34, we can find the pattern that the AdaTrans character encoder outpaces the BiLSTM and CNN character encoders when different word-level encoders being used. Moreover, no matter what character encoder being used or none being used, the AdaTrans word-level encoder gets the best performance. This implies that when the number of training examples increases, the AdaTrans character-level and word-level encoder can better realize their ability.\nWe compare the convergent speed of BiLSTM, ID-CNN, Transformer, and TENER in the development set of the OntoNotes 5.0. The curves are shown in Fig FIGREF37. TENER converges as fast as the BiLSTM model and outperforms the vanilla Transformer.\nIn this paper, we propose TENER, a model adopting Transformer Encoder with specific customizations for the NER task. Transformer Encoder has a powerful ability to capture the long-range context. In order to make the Transformer more suitable to the NER task, we introduce the direction-aware, distance-aware and un-scaled attention. Experiments in two English NER tasks and four Chinese NER tasks show that the performance can be massively increased. Under the same pre-trained embeddings and external knowledge, our proposed modification outperforms previous models in the six datasets. Meanwhile, we also found the adapted Transformer is suitable for being used as the English character encoder, because it has the potentiality to extract intricate patterns from characters. Experiments in two English NER datasets show that the adapted Transformer character encoder performs better than BiLSTM and CNN character encoders.\nWe exploit four kinds of character encoders. For all character encoders, the randomly initialized character embeddings are 30d. The hidden size of BiLSTM used in the character encoder is 50d in each direction. The kernel size of CNN used in the character encoder is 3, and we used 30 kernels with stride 1. For Transformer and adapted Transformer, the number of heads is 3, and every head is 10d, the dropout rate is 0.15, the feed-forward dimension is 60. The Transformer used the sinusoid position embedding. The number of parameters for the character encoder (excluding character embedding) when using BiLSTM, CNN, Transformer and adapted Transformer are 35830, 3660, 8460 and 6600 respectively. For all experiments, the hyper-parameters of character encoders stay unchanged.\nThe hyper-parameters and search ranges for different encoders are presented in Table TABREF40, Table TABREF41 and Table TABREF42.", "question": "Which NER dataset do they use?", "expected_output": "CoNLL2003.

{"id": "1911.04474", "prompt": "The named entity recognition (NER) is the task of finding the start and end of an entity in a sentence and assigning a class for this entity. NER has been widely studied in the field of natural language processing (NLP) because of its potential assistance in question generation BIBREF0, relation extraction BIBREF1, and coreference resolution BIBREF2. Since BIBREF3, various neural models have been introduced to avoid hand-crafted features BIBREF4, BIBREF5, BIBREF6.\nNER is usually viewed as a sequence labeling task, the neural models usually contain three components: word embedding layer, context encoder layer, and decoder layer BIBREF4, BIBREF5, BIBREF6, BIBREF7, BIBREF8, BIBREF9, BIBREF10. The difference between various NER models mainly lies in the variance in these components.\nRecurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are widely employed in NLP tasks due to its sequential characteristic, which is aligned well with language. Specifically, bidirectional long short-term memory networks (BiLSTM) BIBREF11 is one of the most widely used RNN structures. BIBREF4 was the first one to apply the BiLSTM and Conditional Random Fields (CRF) BIBREF12 to sequence labeling tasks. Owing to BiLSTM's high power to learn the contextual representation of words, it has been adopted by the majority of NER models as the encoder BIBREF5, BIBREF6, BIBREF9, BIBREF10.\nRecently, Transformer BIBREF13 began to prevail in various NLP tasks, like machine translation BIBREF13, language modeling BIBREF14, and pretraining models BIBREF15. The Transformer encoder adopts a fully-connected self-attention structure to model the long-range context, which is the weakness of RNNs. Moreover, Transformer has better parallelism ability than RNNs. However, in the NER task, Transformer encoder has been reported to perform poorly BIBREF16, our experiments also confirm this result. Therefore, it is intriguing to explore the reason why Transformer does not work well in NER task.\nIn this paper, we analyze the properties of Transformer and propose two specific improvements for NER.\nThe first is that the sinusoidal position embedding used in the vanilla Transformer is aware of distance but unaware of the directionality. In addition, this property will lose when used in the vanilla Transformer. However, both the direction and distance information are important in the NER task. For example in Fig FIGREF3, words after \u201cin\" are more likely to be a location or time than words before it, and words before \u201cInc.\" are mostly likely to be of the entity type \u201cORG\". Besides, an entity is a continuous span of words. Therefore, the awareness of distance might help the word better recognizes its neighbor. To endow the Transformer with the ability of direction- and distance-awareness, we adopt the relative positional encoding BIBREF17, BIBREF18, BIBREF19. instead of the absolute position encoding. We propose a revised relative positional encoding that uses fewer parameters and performs better.\nThe second is an empirical finding. The attention distribution of the vanilla Transformer is scaled and smooth. But for NER, a sparse attention is suitable since not all words are necessary to be attended. Given a current word, a few contextual words are enough to judge its label. The smooth attention could include some noisy information. Therefore, we abandon the scale factor of dot-production attention and use an un-scaled and sharp attention.\nWith the above improvements, we can greatly boost the performance of Transformer encoder for NER.\nOther than only using Transformer to model the word-level context, we also tried to apply it as a character encoder to model word representation with character-level information. The previous work has proved that character encoder is necessary to capture the character-level features and alleviate the out-of-vocabulary (OOV) problem BIBREF6, BIBREF5, BIBREF7, BIBREF20. In NER, CNN is commonly used as the character encoder. However, we argue that CNN is also not perfect for representing character-level information, because the receptive field of CNN is limited, and the kernel size of the CNN character encoder is usually 3, which means it cannot correctly recognize 2-gram or 4-gram patterns. Although we can deliberately design different kernels, CNN still cannot solve patterns with discontinuous characters, such as \u201cun..ily\u201d in \u201cunhappily\" and \u201cunnecessarily\". Instead, the Transformer-based character encoder shall not only fully make use of the concurrence power of GPUs, but also have the potentiality to recognize different n-grams and even discontinuous patterns. Therefore, in this paper, we also try to use Transformer as the character encoder, and we compare four kinds of character encoders.\nIn summary, to improve the performance of the Transformer-based model in the NER task, we explicitly utilize the directional relative positional encoding, reduce the number of parameters and sharp the attention distribution. After the adaptation, the performance raises a lot, making our model even performs better than BiLSTM based models. Furthermore, in the six NER datasets, we achieve state-of-the-art performance among models without considering the pre-trained language models or designed features.\nBIBREF3 utilized the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and CNN to avoid using task-specific features to tackle different sequence labeling tasks, such as Chunking, Part-of-Speech (POS) and NER. In BIBREF4, BiLSTM-CRF was introduced to solve sequence labeling questions. Since then, the BiLSTM has been extensively used in the field of NER BIBREF7, BIBREF21, BIBREF22, BIBREF5.\nDespite BiLSTM's great success in the NER task, it has to compute token representations one by one, which massively hinders full exploitation of GPU's parallelism. Therefore, CNN has been proposed by BIBREF23, BIBREF24 to encode words concurrently. In order to enlarge the receptive field of CNNs, BIBREF23 used iterative dilated CNNs (ID-CNN).\nSince the word shape information, such as the capitalization and n-gram, is important in recognizing named entities, CNN and BiLSTM have been used to extract character-level information BIBREF7, BIBREF6, BIBREF5, BIBREF23, BIBREF8.\nAlmost all neural-based NER models used pre-trained word embeddings, like Word2vec and Glove BIBREF25, BIBREF26. And when contextual word embeddings are combined, the performance of NER models will boost a lot BIBREF27, BIBREF28, BIBREF29. ELMo introduced by BIBREF28 used the CNN character encoder and BiLSTM language models to get contextualized word representations. Except for the BiLSTM based pre-trained models, BERT was based on Transformer BIBREF15.\nTransformer was introduced by BIBREF13, which was mainly based on self-attention. It achieved great success in various NLP tasks. Since the self-attention mechanism used in the Transformer is unaware of positions, to avoid this shortage, position embeddings were used BIBREF13, BIBREF15. Instead of using the sinusoidal position embedding BIBREF13 and learned absolute position embedding, BIBREF17 argued that the distance between two tokens should be considered when calculating their attention score. BIBREF18 reduced the computation complexity of relative positional encoding from $O(l^2d)$ to $O(ld)$, where $l$ is the length of sequences and $d$ is the hidden size. BIBREF19 derived a new form of relative positional encodings, so that the relative relation could be better considered.\nWe first introduce the Transformer encoder proposed in BIBREF13. The Transformer encoder takes in an matrix $H \\in \\mathbb {R}^{l \\times d}$, where $l$ is the sequence length, $d$ is the input dimension. Then three learnable matrix $W_q$, $W_k$, $W_v$ are used to project $H$ into different spaces. Usually, the matrix size of the three matrix are all $\\mathbb {R}^{d \\times d_k}$, where $d_k$ is a hyper-parameter. After that, the scaled dot-product attention can be calculated by the following equations,\nwhere $Q_t$ is the query vector of the $t$th token, $j$ is the token the $t$th token attends. $K_j$ is the key vector representation of the $j$th token. The softmax is along the last dimension. Instead of using one group of $W_q$, $W_k$, $W_v$, using several groups will enhance the ability of self-attention. When several groups are used, it is called multi-head self-attention, the calculation can be formulated as follows,\nwhere $n$ is the number of heads, the superscript $h$ represents the head index. $[head^{(1)}; ...; head^{(n)}]$ means concatenation in the last dimension. Usually $d_k \\times n = d$, which means the output of $[head^{(1)}; ...; head^{(n)}]$ will be of size $\\mathbb {R}^{l \\times d}$. $W_o$ is a learnable parameter, which is of size $\\mathbb {R}^{d \\times d}$.\nThe output of the multi-head attention will be further processed by the position-wise feed-forward networks, which can be represented as follows,\nwhere $W_1$, $W_2$, $b_1$, $b_2$ are learnable parameters, and $W_1 \\in \\mathbb {R}^{d \\times d_{ff}}$, $W_2 \\in \\mathbb {R}^{d_{ff} \\times d}$, $b_1 \\in \\mathbb {R}^{d_{ff}}$, $b_2 \\in \\mathbb {R}^{d}$. $d_{ff}$ is a hyper-parameter. Other components of the Transformer encoder includes layer normalization and Residual connection, we use them the same as BIBREF13.\nThe self-attention is not aware of the positions of different tokens, making it unable to capture the sequential characteristic of languages. In order to solve this problem, BIBREF13 suggested to use position embeddings generated by sinusoids of varying frequency. The $t$th token's position embedding can be represented by the following equations\nwhere $i$ is in the range of $[0, \\frac{d}{2}]$, $d$ is the input dimension. This sinusoid based position embedding makes Transformer have an ability to model the position of a token and the distance of each two tokens. For any fixed offset $k$, $PE_{t+k}$ can be represented by a linear transformation of $PE_{t}$ BIBREF13.\nIn this paper, we utilize the Transformer encoder to model the long-range and complicated interactions of sentence for NER. The structure of proposed model is shown in Fig FIGREF12. We detail each parts in the following sections.\nTo alleviate the problems of data sparsity and out-of-vocabulary (OOV), most NER models adopted the CNN character encoder BIBREF5, BIBREF30, BIBREF8 to represent words. Compared to BiLSTM based character encoder BIBREF6, BIBREF31, CNN is more efficient. Since Transformer can also fully exploit the GPU's parallelism, it is interesting to use Transformer as the character encoder. A potential benefit of Transformer-based character encoder is to extract different n-grams and even uncontinuous character patterns, like \u201cun..ily\u201d in \u201cunhappily\u201d and \u201cuneasily\u201d. For the model's uniformity, we use the \u201cadapted Transformer\u201d to represent the Transformer introduced in next subsection.\nThe final word embedding is the concatenation of the character features extracted by the character encoder and the pre-trained word embeddings.\nAlthough Transformer encoder has potential advantage in modeling long-range context, it is not working well for NER task. In this paper, we propose an adapted Transformer for NER task with two improvements.\nInspired by the success of BiLSTM in NER tasks, we consider what properties the Transformer lacks compared to BiLSTM-based models. One observation is that BiLSTM can discriminatively collect the context information of a token from its left and right sides. But it is not easy for the Transformer to distinguish which side the context information comes from.\nAlthough the dot product between two sinusoidal position embeddings is able to reflect their distance, it lacks directionality and this property will be broken by the vanilla Transformer attention. To illustrate this, we first prove two properties of the sinusoidal position embeddings.\nProperty 1 For an offset $k$ and a position $t$, $PE_{t+k}^TPE_{t}$ only depends on $k$, which means the dot product of two sinusoidal position embeddings can reflect the distance between two tokens.\nBased on the definitions of Eq.(DISPLAY_FORM11) and Eq.(), the position embedding of $t$-th token is PEt = [ c (c0t)\n(c0t)\n$\\vdots $\n(cd2-1t)\n(cd2-1t)\n], where $d$ is the dimension of the position embedding, $c_i$ is a constant decided by $i$, and its value is $1/10000^{2i/d}$.\nTherefore,\nwhere Eq.(DISPLAY_FORM17) to Eq.() is based on the equation $\\cos (x-y) = \\sin (x)\\sin (y) + \\cos (x)\\cos (y)$.\nProperty 2 For an offset $k$ and a position $t$, $PE_{t}^TPE_{t-k}=PE_{t}^TPE_{t+k}$, which means the sinusoidal position embeddings is unware of directionality.\nLet $j=t-k$, according to property 1, we have\nThe relation between $d$, $k$ and $PE_t^TPE_{t+k}$ is displayed in Fig FIGREF18. The sinusoidal position embeddings are distance-aware but lacks directionality.\nHowever, the property of distance-awareness also disappears when $PE_t$ is projected into the query and key space of self-attention. Since in vanilla Transformer the calculation between $PE_t$ and $PE_{t+k}$ is actually $PE_t^TW_q^TW_kPE_{t+k}$, where $W_q, W_k$ are parameters in Eq.(DISPLAY_FORM7). Mathematically, it can be viewed as $PE_t^TWPE_{t+k}$ with only one parameter $W$. The relation between $PE_t^TPE_{t+k}$ and $PE_t^TWPE_{t+k}$ is depicted in Fig FIGREF19.\nTherefore, to improve the Transformer with direction- and distance-aware characteristic, we calculate the attention scores using the equations below:\nwhere $t$ is index of the target token, $j$ is the index of the context token, $Q_t, K_j$ is the query vector and key vector of token $t, j$ respectively, $W_q, W_v \\in \\mathbb {R}^{d \\times d_k}$. To get $H_{d_k}\\in \\mathbb {R}^{l \\times d_k}$, we first split $H$ into $d/d_k$ partitions in the second dimension, then for each head we use one partition. $\\mathbf {u} \\in \\mathbb {R}^{d_k}$, $\\mathbf {v} \\in \\mathbb {R}^{d_k}$ are learnable parameters, $R_{t-j}$ is the relative positional encoding, and $R_{t-j} \\in \\mathbb {R}^{d_k}$, $i$ in Eq.() is in the range $[0, \\frac{d_k}{2}]$. $Q_t^TK_j$ in Eq.() is the attention score between two tokens; $Q_t^TR_{t-j}$ is the $t$th token's bias on certain relative distance; $u^TK_j$ is the bias on the $j$th token; $v^TR_{t-j}$ is the bias term for certain distance and direction.\nBased on Eq.(), we have\nbecause $\\sin (-x)=-\\sin (x), \\cos (x)=\\cos (-x)$. This means for an offset $t$, the forward and backward relative positional encoding are the same with respect to the $\\cos (c_it)$ terms, but is the opposite with respect to the $\\sin (c_it)$ terms. Therefore, by using $R_{t-j}$, the attention score can distinguish different directions and distances.\nThe above improvement is based on the work BIBREF17, BIBREF19. Since the size of NER datasets is usually small, we avoid direct multiplication of two learnable parameters, because they can be represented by one learnable parameter. Therefore we do not use $W_k$ in Eq.(DISPLAY_FORM22). The multi-head version is the same as Eq.(DISPLAY_FORM8), but we discard $W_o$ since it is directly multiplied by $W_1$ in Eq.(DISPLAY_FORM9).\nThe vanilla Transformer use the scaled dot-product attention to smooth the output of softmax function. In Eq.(), the dot product of key and value matrices is divided by the scaling factor $\\sqrt{d_k}$.\nWe empirically found that models perform better without the scaling factor $\\sqrt{d_k}$. We presume this is because without the scaling factor the attention will be sharper. And the sharper attention might be beneficial in the NER task since only few words in the sentence are named entities.\nIn order to take advantage of dependency between different tags, the Conditional Random Field (CRF) was used in all of our models. Given a sequence $\\mathbf {s}=[s_1, s_2, ..., s_T]$, the corresponding golden label sequence is $\\mathbf {y}=[y_1, y_2, ..., y_T]$, and $\\mathbf {Y}(\\mathbf {s})$ represents all valid label sequences. The probability of $\\mathbf {y}$ is calculated by the following equation\nwhere $f(\\mathbf {y}_{t-1},\\mathbf {y}_t,\\mathbf {s})$ computes the transition score from $\\mathbf {y}_{t-1}$ to $\\mathbf {y}_t$ and the score for $\\mathbf {y}_t$. The optimization target is to maximize $P(\\mathbf {y}|\\mathbf {s})$. When decoding, the Viterbi Algorithm is used to find the path achieves the maximum probability.\nWe evaluate our model in two English NER datasets and four Chinese NER datasets.\n(1) CoNLL2003 is one of the most evaluated English NER datasets, which contains four different named entities: PERSON, LOCATION, ORGANIZATION, and MISC BIBREF34.\n(2) OntoNotes 5.0 is an English NER dataset whose corpus comes from different domains, such as telephone conversation, newswire. We exclude the New Testaments portion since there is no named entity in it BIBREF8, BIBREF7. This dataset has eleven entity names and seven value types, like CARDINAL, MONEY, LOC.\n(3) BIBREF35 released OntoNotes 4.0. In this paper, we use the Chinese part. We adopted the same pre-process as BIBREF36.\n(4) The corpus of the Chinese NER dataset MSRA came from news domain BIBREF37.\n(5) Weibo NER was built based on text in Chinese social media Sina Weibo BIBREF38, and it contained 4 kinds of entities.\n(6) Resume NER was annotated by BIBREF33.\nTheir statistics are listed in Table TABREF28. For all datasets, we replace all digits with \u201c0\u201d, and use the BIOES tag schema. For English, we use the Glove 100d pre-trained embedding BIBREF25. For the character encoder, we use 30d randomly initialized character embeddings. More details on models' hyper-parameters can be found in the supplementary material. For Chinese, we used the character embedding and bigram embedding released by BIBREF33. All pre-trained embeddings are finetuned during training. In order to reduce the impact of randomness, we ran all of our experiments at least three times, and its average F1 score and standard deviation are reported.\nWe used random-search to find the optimal hyper-parameters, hyper-parameters and their ranges are displayed in the supplemental material. We use SGD and 0.9 momentum to optimize the model. We run 100 epochs and each batch has 16 samples. During the optimization, we use the triangle learning rate BIBREF39 where the learning rate rises to the pre-set learning rate at the first 1% steps and decreases to 0 in the left 99% steps. The model achieves the highest development performance was used to evaluate the test set. The hyper-parameter search range and other settings can be found in the supplementary material. Codes are available at https://github.com/fastnlp/TENER.\nWe first present our results in the four Chinese NER datasets. Since Chinese NER is directly based on the characters, it is more straightforward to show the abilities of different models without considering the influence of word representation.\nAs shown in Table TABREF29, the vanilla Transformer does not perform well and is worse than the BiLSTM and CNN based models. However, when relative positional encoding combined, the performance was enhanced greatly, resulting in better results than the BiLSTM and CNN in all datasets. The number of training examples of the Weibo dataset is tiny, therefore the performance of the Transformer is abysmal, which is as expected since the Transformer is data-hungry. Nevertheless, when enhanced with the relative positional encoding and unscaled attention, it can achieve even better performance than the BiLSTM-based model. The superior performance of the adapted Transformer in four datasets ranging from small datasets to big datasets depicts that the adapted Transformer is more robust to the number of training examples than the vanilla Transformer. As the last line of Table TABREF29 depicts, the scaled attention will deteriorate the performance.\nThe comparison between different NER models on English NER datasets is shown in Table TABREF32. The poor performance of the Transformer in the NER datasets was also reported by BIBREF16. Although performance of the Transformer is higher than BIBREF16, it still lags behind the BiLSTM-based models BIBREF5. Nonetheless, the performance is massively enhanced by incorporating the relative positional encoding and unscaled attention into the Transformer. The adaptation not only makes the Transformer achieve superior performance than BiLSTM based models, but also unveil the new state-of-the-art performance in two NER datasets when only the Glove 100d embedding and CNN character embedding are used. The same deterioration of performance was observed when using the scaled attention. Besides, if ELMo was used BIBREF28, the performance of TENER can be further boosted as depicted in Table TABREF33.\nThe character-level encoder has been widely used in the English NER task to alleviate the data sparsity and OOV problem in word representation. In this section, we cross different character-level encoders (BiLSTM, CNN, Transformer encoder and our adapted Transformer encoder (AdaTrans for short) ) and different word-level encoders (BiLSTM, ID-CNN and AdaTrans) to implement the NER task. Results on CoNLL2003 and OntoNotes 5.0 are presented in Table TABREF34 and Table TABREF34, respectively.\nThe ID-CNN encoder is from BIBREF23, and we re-implement their model in PyTorch. For different combinations, we use random search to find its best hyper-parameters. Hyper-parameters for character encoders were fixed. The details can be found in the supplementary material.\nFor the results on CoNLL2003 dataset which is depicted in Table TABREF34, the AdaTrans performs as good as the BiLSTM in different character encoder scenario averagely. In addition, from Table TABREF34, we can find the pattern that the AdaTrans character encoder outpaces the BiLSTM and CNN character encoders when different word-level encoders being used. Moreover, no matter what character encoder being used or none being used, the AdaTrans word-level encoder gets the best performance. This implies that when the number of training examples increases, the AdaTrans character-level and word-level encoder can better realize their ability.\nWe compare the convergent speed of BiLSTM, ID-CNN, Transformer, and TENER in the development set of the OntoNotes 5.0. The curves are shown in Fig FIGREF37. TENER converges as fast as the BiLSTM model and outperforms the vanilla Transformer.\nIn this paper, we propose TENER, a model adopting Transformer Encoder with specific customizations for the NER task. Transformer Encoder has a powerful ability to capture the long-range context.

{"id": "1905.00840", "prompt": "Knowledge representation and reasoning (KRR) is the process of representing the domain knowledge in formal languages (e.g., SPARQL, Prolog) such that it can be used by expert systems to execute querying and reasoning services. KRR have been applied in many fields including financial regulations, medical diagnosis, laws, and so on. One major obstacle in KRR is the creation of large-scale knowledge bases with high quality. For one thing, this requires the knowledge engineers (KEs) not only to have the background knowledge in a certain domain but have enough skills in knowledge representation as well. Unfortunately, qualified KEs are also in short supply. Therefore, it would be useful to build a tool that allows the domain experts without any background in logic to construct and query the knowledge base simply from text.\nControlled natural languages (CNLs) BIBREF0 were developed as a technology that achieves this goal. CNLs are designed based on natural languages (NLs) but with restricted syntax and interpretation rules that determine the unique meaning of the sentence. Representative CNLs include Attempto Controlled English BIBREF1 and PENG BIBREF2 . Each CNL is developed with a language parser which translates the English sentences into an intermediate structure, discourse representation structure (DRS) BIBREF3 . Based on the DRS structure, the language parsers further translate the DRS into the corresponding logical representations, e.g., Answer Set Programming (ASP) BIBREF4 programs. One main issue with the aforementioned CNLs is that the systems do not provide enough background knowledge to preserve semantic equivalences of sentences that represent the same meaning but are expressed via different linguistic structures. For instance, the sentences Mary buys a car and Mary makes a purchase of a car are translated into different logical representations by the current CNL parsers. As a result, if the user ask a question who is a buyer of a car, these systems will fail to find the answer.\nIn this thesis proposal, I will present KALM BIBREF5 , BIBREF6 , a system for knowledge authoring and question answering. KALM is superior to the current CNL systems in that KALM has a complex frame-semantic parser which can standardize the semantics of the sentences that express the same meaning via different linguistic structures. The frame-semantic parser is built based on FrameNet BIBREF7 and BabelNet BIBREF8 where FrameNet is used to capture the meaning of the sentence and BabelNet BIBREF8 is used to disambiguate the meaning of the extracted entities from the sentence. Experiment results show that KALM achieves superior accuracy in knowledge authoring and question answering as compared to the state-of-the-art systems.\nThe rest parts are organized as follows: Section SECREF2 discusses the related works, Section SECREF3 presents the KALM architecture, Section SECREF4 presents KALM-QA, the question answering part of KALM, Section SECREF5 shows the evaluation results, Section SECREF6 shows the future work beyond the thesis, and Section SECREF7 concludes the paper.\nAs is described in Section SECREF1 , CNL systems were proposed as the technology for knowledge representation and reasoning. Related works also include knowledge extraction tools, e.g., OpenIE BIBREF9 , SEMEFOR BIBREF10 , SLING BIBREF11 , and Standford KBP system BIBREF12 . These knowledge extraction tools are designed to extract semantic relations from English sentences that capture the meaning. The limitations of these tools are two-fold: first, they lack sufficient accuracy to extract the correct semantic relations and entities while KRR is very sensitive to incorrect data; second, these systems are not able to map the semantic relations to logical forms and therefore not capable of doing KRR. Other related works include the question answering frameworks, e.g., Memory Network BIBREF13 , Variational Reasoning Network BIBREF14 , ATHENA BIBREF15 , PowerAqua BIBREF16 . The first two belong to end-to-end learning approaches based on machine learning models. The last two systems have implemented semantic parsers which translate natural language sentences into intermediate query languages and then query the knowledge base to get the answers. For the machine learning based approaches, the results are not explainable. Besides, their accuracy is not high enough to provide correct answers. For ATHENA and PowerAqua, these systems perform question answering based on a priori knowledge bases. Therefore, they do not support knowledge authoring while KALM is able to support both knowledge authoring and question answering.\nFigure FIGREF1 shows the architecture of KALM which translates a CNL sentence to the corresponding logical representations, unique logical representations (ULR).\nAttempto Parsing Engine. The input sentences are CNL sentences based on ACE grammar. KALM starts with parsing the input sentence using ACE Parser and generates the DRS structure BIBREF17 which captures the syntactic information of the sentences.\nFrame Parser. KALM performs frame-based parsing based on the DRS and produces a set of frames that represent the semantic relations a sentence implies. A frame BIBREF18 represents a semantic relation of a set of entities where each plays a particular role in the frame relation. We have designed a frame ontology, called FrameOnt, which is based on the frames in FrameNet BIBREF7 and encoded as a Prolog fact. For instance, the Commerce_Buy frame is shown below:\n fp(Commerce_Buy,[\n role(Buyer,[bn:00014332n],[]),\n role(Seller,[bn:00053479n],[]),\n role(Goods,[bn:00006126n,bn:00021045n],[]),\n role(Recipient,[bn:00066495n],[]),\n role(Money,[bn:00017803n],[currency])]).\n In each role-term, the first argument is the name of the role and the second is a list of role meanings represented via BabelNet synset IDs BIBREF8 . The third argument of a role-term is a list of constraints on that role. For instance, the sentence Mary buys a car implies the Commerce_Buy frame where Mary is the Buyer and car is the Goods. To extract a frame instance from a given CNL sentence, KALM uses logical valence patterns (lvps) which are learned via structural learning. An example of the lvp is shown below:\n lvp(buy,v,Commerce_Buy, [\n pattern(Buyer,verb->subject,required),\n pattern(Goods,verb->object,required),\n pattern(Recipient,verb->pp(for)->dep,optnl),\n pattern(Money,verb->pp(for)->dep,optnl),\n pattern(Seller,verb->pp(from)->dep,optnl)]).\nThe first three arguments of an lvp-fact identify the lexical unit, its part of speech, and the frame. The fourth argument is a set of pattern-terms, each having three parts: the name of a role, a grammatical pattern, and the required/optional flag. The grammatical pattern determines the grammatical context in which the lexical unit, a role, and a role-filler word can appear in that frame. Each grammatical pattern is captured by a parsing rule (a Prolog rule) that can be used to extract appropriate role-filler words based on the APE parses.\nRole-filler Disambiguation. Based on the extracted frame instance, the role-filler disambiguation module disambiguates the meaning of each role-filler word for the corresponding frame role a BabelNet Synset ID. A complex algorithm BIBREF5 was proposed to measure the semantic similarity between a candidate BabelNet synset that contains the role-filler word and the frame-role synset. The algorithm also has optimizations that improve the efficiency of the algorithm e.g., priority-based search, caching, and so on. In addition to disambiguating the meaning of the role-fillers, this module is also used to prune the extracted frame instances where the role-filler word and the frame role are semantically incompatible.\nConstructing ULR. The extracted frame instances are translated into the corresponding logical representations, unique logical representation (ULR). Examples can be found in reference BIBREF5 .\nBased on KALM, KALM-QA BIBREF6 is developed for question answering. KALM-QA shares the same components with KALM for syntactic parsing, frame-based parsing and role-filler disambiguation. Different from KALM, KALM-QA translates the questions to unique logical representation for queries (ULRQ), which are used to query the authored knowledge base.\nThis section provides a summary of the evaluation of KALM and KALM-QA, where KALM is evaluated for knowledge authoring and KALM-QA is evaluated for question answering. We have created a total of 50 logical frames, mostly derived from FrameNet but also some that FrameNet is missing (like Restaurant, Human_Gender) for representing the meaning of English sentences. Based on the 50 frames, we have manually constructed 250 sentences that are adapted from FrameNet exemplar sentences and evaluate these sentences on KALM, SEMAFOR, SLING, and Stanford KBP system. KALM achieves an accuracy of 95.6%\u2014much higher than the other systems.\nFor KALM-QA, we evaluate it on two datasets. The first dataset is manually constructed general questions based on the 50 logical frames. KALM-QA achieves an accuracy of 95% for parsing the queries. The second dataset we use is MetaQA dataset BIBREF14 , which contains contains almost 29,000 test questions and over 260,000 training questions. KALM-QA achieves 100% accuracy\u2014much higher than the state-of-the-art machine learning approach BIBREF14 . Details of the evaluations can be found in BIBREF5 and BIBREF6 .\nThis section discusses the future work beyond the thesis: (1) enhancing KALM to author rules, and (2) supporting time reasoning.\nAuthoring Rules from CNL. There are two research problems with rules. The first problem is the standardization of rules parses that express the same information but via different syntactic forms or using different expressions. Suppose the knowledge base contains sentences like: (1) if a person buys a car then the person owns the car, (2) every person who is a purchaser of a car is an owner of the car, (3) if a car is bought by a person then the person possesses the car. All the above sentences represent rules and express exactly the same meaning. However, KALM's current syntactic parser will represent them in different DRSs and therefore not being able to map them into the same logical form. The second problem involves the recognition and representation of different types of rules in logic. For instance, defeasible rules are very common in text. However, this type of rules cannot be handled by first order logic. We believe defeasible logic BIBREF19 is a good fit.\nTime Reasoning. Time-related information is a crucial part of human knowledge, but semantic parsing that takes the time into account is rather hard. However, we can develop a CNL that would incorporate enough time related idioms to be useful in a number of domains of discourse (e.g., tax law). Time can then be added to DRSs and incorporated into our frame based approach down to the very level of the logical facts into which sentences will be translated. This time information can be represented either via special time-aware relations among events (e.g., before, after, causality, triggering) or using a reserved argument to represent time in each fluent.\nThis thesis proposal provides an overview of KALM, a system for knowledge authoring.

{"id": "1905.00840", "prompt": "Knowledge representation and reasoning (KRR) is the process of representing the domain knowledge in formal languages (e.g., SPARQL, Prolog) such that it can be used by expert systems to execute querying and reasoning services. KRR have been applied in many fields including financial regulations, medical diagnosis, laws, and so on. One major obstacle in KRR is the creation of large-scale knowledge bases with high quality. For one thing, this requires the knowledge engineers (KEs) not only to have the background knowledge in a certain domain but have enough skills in knowledge representation as well. Unfortunately, qualified KEs are also in short supply. Therefore, it would be useful to build a tool that allows the domain experts without any background in logic to construct and query the knowledge base simply from text.\nControlled natural languages (CNLs) BIBREF0 were developed as a technology that achieves this goal. CNLs are designed based on natural languages (NLs) but with restricted syntax and interpretation rules that determine the unique meaning of the sentence. Representative CNLs include Attempto Controlled English BIBREF1 and PENG BIBREF2 . Each CNL is developed with a language parser which translates the English sentences into an intermediate structure, discourse representation structure (DRS) BIBREF3 . Based on the DRS structure, the language parsers further translate the DRS into the corresponding logical representations, e.g., Answer Set Programming (ASP) BIBREF4 programs. One main issue with the aforementioned CNLs is that the systems do not provide enough background knowledge to preserve semantic equivalences of sentences that represent the same meaning but are expressed via different linguistic structures. For instance, the sentences Mary buys a car and Mary makes a purchase of a car are translated into different logical representations by the current CNL parsers. As a result, if the user ask a question who is a buyer of a car, these systems will fail to find the answer.\nIn this thesis proposal, I will present KALM BIBREF5 , BIBREF6 , a system for knowledge authoring and question answering. KALM is superior to the current CNL systems in that KALM has a complex frame-semantic parser which can standardize the semantics of the sentences that express the same meaning via different linguistic structures. The frame-semantic parser is built based on FrameNet BIBREF7 and BabelNet BIBREF8 where FrameNet is used to capture the meaning of the sentence and BabelNet BIBREF8 is used to disambiguate the meaning of the extracted entities from the sentence. Experiment results show that KALM achieves superior accuracy in knowledge authoring and question answering as compared to the state-of-the-art systems.\nThe rest parts are organized as follows: Section SECREF2 discusses the related works, Section SECREF3 presents the KALM architecture, Section SECREF4 presents KALM-QA, the question answering part of KALM, Section SECREF5 shows the evaluation results, Section SECREF6 shows the future work beyond the thesis, and Section SECREF7 concludes the paper.\nAs is described in Section SECREF1 , CNL systems were proposed as the technology for knowledge representation and reasoning. Related works also include knowledge extraction tools, e.g., OpenIE BIBREF9 , SEMEFOR BIBREF10 , SLING BIBREF11 , and Standford KBP system BIBREF12 . These knowledge extraction tools are designed to extract semantic relations from English sentences that capture the meaning. The limitations of these tools are two-fold: first, they lack sufficient accuracy to extract the correct semantic relations and entities while KRR is very sensitive to incorrect data; second, these systems are not able to map the semantic relations to logical forms and therefore not capable of doing KRR. Other related works include the question answering frameworks, e.g., Memory Network BIBREF13 , Variational Reasoning Network BIBREF14 , ATHENA BIBREF15 , PowerAqua BIBREF16 .

{"id": "1810.02229", "prompt": "Current societies are exposed to a continuous flow of information that results in a large production of data (e.g. news articles, micro-blogs, social media posts, among others), at different moments in time. In addition to this, the consumption of information has dramatically changed: more and more people directly access information through social media platforms (e.g. Facebook and Twitter), and are less and less exposed to a diversity of perspectives and opinions. The combination of these factors may easily result in information overload and impenetrable \u201cfilter bubbles\u201d. Events, i.e. things that happen or hold as true in the world, are the basic components of such data stream. Being able to correctly identify and classify them plays a major role to develop robust solutions to deal with the current stream of data (e.g. the storyline framework BIBREF0 ), as well to improve the performance of many Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications such as automatic summarization and question answering (Q.A.).\nEvent detection and classification has seen a growing interest in the NLP community thanks to the availability of annotated corpora BIBREF1 , BIBREF2 , BIBREF3 , BIBREF4 and evaluation campaigns BIBREF5 , BIBREF6 , BIBREF7 , BIBREF8 , BIBREF9 , BIBREF10 . In the context of the 2014 EVALITA Workshop, the EVENTI evaluation exercise BIBREF11 was organized to promote research in Italian Temporal Processing, of which event detection and classification is a core subtask.\nSince the EVENTI campaign, there has been a lack of further research, especially in the application of deep learning models to this task in Italian. The contributions of this paper are the followings: i.) the adaptation of a state-of-the-art sequence to sequence (seq2seq) neural system to event detection and classification for Italian in a single step approach; ii.) an investigation on the quality of existing Italian word embeddings for this task; iii.) a comparison against a state-of-the-art discrete classifier. The pre-trained models and scripts running the system (or re-train it) are publicly available. .\nWe follow the formulation of the task as specified in the EVENTI exercise: determine the extent and the class of event mentions in a text, according to the It-TimeML $<$ EVENT $>$ tag definition (Subtask B in EVENTI).\nIn EVENTI, the tag $<$ EVENT $>$ is applied to every linguistic expression denoting a situation that happens or occurs, or a state in which something obtains or holds true, regardless of the specific parts-of-speech that may realize it. EVENTI distinguishes between single token and multi-tokens events, where the latter are restricted to specific cases of eventive multi-word expressions in lexicographic dictionaries (e.g. \u201cfare le valigie\u201d [to pack]), verbal periphrases (e.g. \u201c(essere) in grado di\u201d [(to be) able to]; \u201cc'\u00e8\u201d [there is]), and named events (e.g. \u201cla strage di Beslan\u201d [Beslan school siege]).\nEach event is further assigned to one of 7 possible classes, namely: OCCURRENCE, ASPECTUAL, PERCEPTION, REPORTING, I(NTESIONAL)_STATE, I(NTENSIONAL)_ACTION, and STATE. These classes are derived from the English TimeML Annotation Guidelines BIBREF12 . The TimeML event classes distinguishes with respect to other classifications, such as ACE BIBREF1 or FrameNet BIBREF13 , because they expresses relationships the target event participates in (such as factual, evidential, reported, intensional) rather than semantic categories denoting the meaning of the event. This means that the EVENT classes are assigned by taking into account both the semantic and the syntactic context of occurrence of the target event. Readers are referred to the EVENTI Annotation Guidelines for more details.\nThe EVENTI corpus consists of three datasets: the Main Task training data, the Main task test data, and the Pilot task test data. The Main Task data are on contemporary news articles, while the Pilot Task on historical news articles. For our experiments, we focused only on the Main Task. In addition to the training and test data, we have created also a Main Task development set by excluding from the training data all the articles that composed the test data of the Italian dataset at the SemEval 2010 TempEval-2 campaign BIBREF6 . The new partition of the corpus results in the following distribution of the $<$ EVENT $>$ tag: i) 17,528 events in the training data, of which 1,207 are multi-token mentions; ii.) 301 events in the development set, of which 13 are multi-token mentions; and finally, iii.) 3,798 events in the Main task test, of which 271 are multi-token mentions.\nTables 1 and 1 report, respectively, the distribution of the events per token part-of speech (POS) and per event class. Not surprisingly, verbs are the largest annotated category, followed by nouns, adjectives, and prepositional phrases. Such a distribution reflects both a kind of \u201cnatural\u201d distribution of the realization of events in an Indo-european language, and, at the same time, specific annotation choices. For instance, adjectives have been annotated only when in a predicative position and when introduced by a copula or a copular construction. As for the classes, OCCURRENCE and STATE represent the large majority of all events, followed by the intensional ones (I_STATE and I_ACTION), expressing some factual relationship between the target events and their arguments, and finally the others (REPORTING, ASPECTUAL, and PERCEPTION).\nWe adapted a publicly available Bi-LSTM network with a CRF classifier as last layer BIBREF14 . BIBREF14 demonstrated that word embeddings, among other hyper-parameters, have a major impact on the performance of the network, regardless of the specific task. On the basis of these experimental observations, we decided to investigate the impact of different Italian word embeddings for the Subtask B Main Task of the EVENTI exercise. We thus selected 5 word embeddings for Italian to initialize the network, differentiating one with respect to each other either for the representation model used (word2vec vs. GloVe; CBOW vs. skip-gram), dimensionality (300 vs. 100), or corpora used for their generation (Italian Wikipedia vs. crawled web document vs. large textual corpora or archives):\nAs for the other parameters, the network maintains the optimized configurations used for the event detection task for English BIBREF14 : two LSTM layers of 100 units each, Nadam optimizer, variational dropout (0.5, 0.5), with gradient normalization ( $\\tau $ = 1), and batch size of 8. Character-level embeddings, learned using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) BIBREF22 , are concatenated with the word embedding vector to feed into the LSTM network. Final layer of the network is a CRF classifier.\nEvaluation is conducted using the EVENTI evaluation framework. Standard Precision, Recall, and F1 apply for the event detection. Given that the extent of an event tag may be composed by more than one tokens, systems are evaluated both for strict match, i.e. one point only if all tokens which compose an $<$ EVENT $>$ tag are correctly identified, and relaxed match, i.e. one point for any correct overlap between the system output and the reference gold data. The classification aspect is evaluated using the F1-attribute score BIBREF7 , that captures how well a system identify both the entity (extent) and attribute (i.e. class) together.\nWe approached the task in a single-step by detecting and classifying event mentions at once rather than in the standard two step approach, i.e. detection first and classification on top of the detected elements. The task is formulated as a seq2seq problem, by converting the original annotation format into an BIO scheme (Beginning, Inside, Outside), with the resulting alphabet being B-class_label, I-class_label and O. Example \"System and Experiments\" below illustrates a simplified version of the problem for a short sentence:\n input problem solution\n Marco (B-STATE $|$ I-STATE $|$ ... $|$ O) O\n pensa (B-STATE $|$ I-STATE $|$ ... $|$ O) B-ISTATE\n di (B-STATE $|$ I-STATE $|$ ... $|$ O) O\n andare (B-STATE $|$ I-STATE $|$ ... $|$ O) B-OCCUR\n a (B-STATE $|$ I-STATE $|$ ... $|$ O) O\n casa (B-STATE $|$ I-STATE $|$ ... $|$ O) O\n . (B-STATE $|$ I-STATE $|$ ... $|$ O) O\nResults for the experiments are illustrated in Table 2 . We also report the results of the best system that participated at EVENTI Subtask B, FBK-HLT BIBREF23 . FBK-HLT is a cascade of two SVM classifiers (one for detection and one for classification) based on rich linguistic features. Figure 1 plots charts comparing F1 scores of the network initialized with each of the five embeddings against the FBK-HLT system for the event detection and classification tasks, respectively.\nThe results of the Bi-LSTM-CRF network are varied in both evaluation configurations. The differences are mainly due to the embeddings used to initialize the network. The best embedding configuration is Fastext-It that differentiate from all the others for the approach used for generating the embeddings. Embedding's dimensionality impacts on the performances supporting the findings in BIBREF14 , but it seems that the quantity (and variety) of data used to generate the embeddings can have a mitigating effect, as shown by the results of the DH-FBK-100 configuration (especially in the classification subtask, and in the Recall scores for the event extent subtask). Coverage of the embeddings (and consequenlty, tokenization of the dataset and the embeddings) is a further aspect to keep into account, but it seems to have a minor impact with respect to dimensionality. It turns out that BIBREF15 's embeddings are those suffering the most from out of vocabulary (OVV) tokens (2.14% and 1.06% in training, 2.77% and 1.84% in test for the word2vec model and GloVe, respectively) with respect to the others. However, they still outperform DH-FBK_100 and ILC-ItWack, whose OVV are much lower (0.73% in training and 1.12% in test for DH-FBK_100; 0.74% in training and 0.83% in test for ILC-ItWack).\nThe network obtains the best F1 score, both for detection (F1 of 0.880 for strict evaluation and 0.903 for relaxed evaluation with Fastext-It embeddings) and for classification (F1-class of 0.756 for strict evaluation, and 0.751 for relaxed evaluation with Fastext-It embeddings). Although FBK-HLT suffers in the classification subtask, it qualifies as a highly competitive system for the detection subtask. By observing the strict F1 scores, FBK-HLT beats three configurations (DH-FBK-100, ILC-ItWack, Berardi2015_Glove) , almost equals one (Berardi2015_w2v) , and it is outperformed only by one (Fastext-It) . In the relaxed evaluation setting, DH-FBK-100 is the only configuration that does not beat FBK-HLT (although the difference is only 0.001 point). Nevertheless, it is remarkable to observe that FBK-HLT has a very high Precision (0.902, relaxed evaluation mode), that is overcome by only one embedding configuration, ILC-ItWack. The results also indicates that word embeddings have a major contribution on Recall, supporting observations that distributed representations have better generalization capabilities than discrete feature vectors. This is further supported by the fact that these results are obtained using a single step approach, where the network has to deal with a total of 15 possible different labels.\nWe further compared the outputs of the best model, i.e. Fastext-It, against FBK-HLT. As for the event detection subtask, we have adopted an event-based analysis rather than a token based one, as this will provide better insights on errors concerning multi-token events and event parts-of-speech (see Table 1 for reference). By analyzing the True Positives, we observe that the Fastext-It model has better performances than FBK-HLT with nouns (77.78% vs. 65.64%, respectively) and prepositional phrases (28.00% vs. 16.00%, respectively). Performances are very close for verbs (88.04% vs. 88.49%, respectively) and adjectives (80.50% vs. 79.66%, respectively). These results, especially those for prepositional phrases, indicates that the Bi-LSTM-CRF network structure and embeddings are also much more robust at detecting multi-tokens instances of events, and difficult realizations of events, such as nouns.\nConcerning the classification, we focused on the mismatches between correctly identified events (extent layer) and class assignment. The Fastext-It model wrongly assigns the class to only 557 event tokens compared to the 729 cases for FBK-HLT. The distribution of the class errors, in terms of absolute numbers, is the same between the two systems, with the top three wrong classes being, in both cases, OCCURRENCE, I_ACTION and STATE. OCCURRENCE, not surprisingly, is the class that tends to be assigned more often by both systems, being also the most frequent. However, if FBK-HLT largely overgeneralizes OCCURRENCE (59.53% of all class errors), this corresponds to only one third of the errors (37.70%) in the Bi-LSTM-CRF network. Other notable differences concern I_ACTION (27.82% of errors for the Bi-LSTM-CRF vs. 17.28% for FBK-HLT), STATE (8.79% for the Bi-LSTM-CRF vs. 15.22% for FBK-HLT) and REPORTING (7.89% for the Bi-LSTM-CRF vs. 2.33% for FBK-HLT) classes.\nThis paper has investigated the application of different word embeddings for the initialization of a state-of-the-art Bi-LSTM-CRF network to solve the event detection and classification task in Italian, according to the EVENTI exercise. We obtained new state-of-the-art results using the Fastext-It embeddings, and improved the F1-class score of 6.5 points in strict evaluation mode. As for the event detection subtask, we observe a limited improvement (+1.3 points in strict F1), mainly due to gains in Recall. Such results are extremely positive as the task has been modeled in a single step approach, i.e. detection and classification at once, for the first time in Italian. Further support that embeddings have a major impact in the performance of neural architectures is provided, as the variations in performance of the Bi-LSMT-CRF models show. This is due to a combination of factors such as dimensionality, (raw) data, and the method used for generating the embeddings.\nFuture work should focus on the development of embeddings that move away from the basic word level, integrating extra layers of linguistic analysis (e.g. syntactic dependencies) BIBREF24 , that have proven to be very powerful for the same task in English.\nThe author wants to thank all researchers and research groups who made available their word embeddings and their code.

Thus, in this work, we introduce new datasets and methods so that we can study subtle gender associations in language at the large-scale.\nOur contributions include:\nTwo datasets for studying language and gender, each consisting of over 300K sentences.\nMethods to infer gender-associated words and labeled clusters in any domain.\nNovel findings that demonstrate in both domains that people do talk about women and men in different ways.\nEach contribution brings us closer to modeling how gender associations appear in everyday language. In the remainder of the paper, we present related work, our data collection, methods and findings, and human evaluations of our system.\nThe study of gender and language has a rich history in social science. Its roots are often attributed to Robin Lakoff, who argued that language is fundamental to gender inequality, \u201creflected in both the ways women are expected to speak, and the ways in which women are spoken of\u201d BIBREF2. Prominent scholars following Lakoff have included Deborah Tannen BIBREF3, Mary Bucholtz and Kira Hall BIBREF4, Janet Holmes BIBREF5, Penelope Eckert BIBREF6, and Deborah Cameron BIBREF7, along with many others.\nIn recent decades, the study of gender and language has also attracted computational researchers. Echoing Lakoff's original claim, a popular strand of computational work focuses on differences in how women and men talk, analyzing key lexical traits BIBREF8, BIBREF9, BIBREF10 and predicting a person's gender from some text they have written BIBREF11, BIBREF12. There is also research studying how people talk to women and men BIBREF13, as well as how people talk about women and men, typically in specific domains such as sports journalism BIBREF14, fiction writing BIBREF15, movie scripts BIBREF16, and Wikipedia biographies BIBREF17, BIBREF18. Our work builds on this body by diving into two novel domains: celebrity news, which explores gender in pop culture, and student reviews of CS professors, which examines gender in academia and, particularly, the historically male-dominated field of CS. Furthermore, many of these works rely on manually constructed lexicons or topics to pinpoint gendered language, but our methods automatically infer gender-associated words and labeled clusters, thus reducing supervision and increasing the potential to discover subtleties in the data.\nModeling gender associations in language could also be instrumental to other NLP tasks. Abusive language is often founded in sexism BIBREF0, BIBREF1, so models of gender associations could help to improve detection in those cases. Gender bias also manifests in NLP pipelines: prior research has found that word embeddings preserve gender biases BIBREF19, BIBREF20, BIBREF21, and some have developed methods to reduce this bias BIBREF22, BIBREF23. Yet, the problem is far from solved; for example, BIBREF24 showed that it is still possible to recover gender bias from \u201cde-biased\u201d embeddings. These findings further motivate our research, since before we can fully reduce gender bias in embeddings, we need to develop a deeper understanding of how gender permeates through language in the first place.\nWe also build on methods to cluster words in word embedding space and automatically label clusters. Clustering word embeddings has proven useful for discovering salient patterns in text corpora BIBREF25, BIBREF26. Once clusters are derived, we would like them to be interpretable. Much research simply considers the top-n words from each cluster, but this method can be subjective and time-consuming to interpret. Thus, there are efforts to design methods of automatic cluster labeling BIBREF27. We take a similar approach to BIBREF28, who leverage word embeddings and WordNet during labeling, and we extend their method with additional techniques and evaluations.\nOur first dataset contains articles from celebrity magazines People, UsWeekly, and E!News. We labeled each article for whether it was reporting on men, women, or neither/unknown. To do this, we first extracted the article's topic tags. Some of these tags referred to people, but others to non-people entities, such as \u201cGift Ideas\u201d or \u201cHealth.\u201d To distinguish between these types of tags, we queried each tag on Wikipedia and checked whether the top page result contained a \u201cBorn\u201d entry in its infobox \u2013 if so, we concluded that the tag referred to a person.\nThen, from the person's Wikipedia page, we determined their gender by checking whether the introductory paragraphs of the page contained more male or female pronouns. This method was simple but effective, since pronouns in the introduction almost always resolve to the subject of that page. In fact, on a sample of 80 tags that we manually annotated, we found that comparing pronoun counts predicted gender with perfect accuracy. Finally, if an article tagged at least one woman and did not tag any men, we labeled the article as Female; in the opposite case, we labeled it as Male.\nOur second dataset contains reviews from RateMyProfessors (RMP), an online platform where students can review their professors. We included all 5,604 U.S. schools on RMP, and collected all reviews for CS professors at those schools. We labeled each review with the gender of the professor whom it was about, which we determined by comparing the count of male versus female pronouns over all reviews for that professor. This method was again effective, because the reviews are expressly written about a certain professor, so the pronouns typically resolve to that professor.\nIn addition to extracting the text of the articles or reviews, for each dataset we also collected various useful metadata. For the celebrity dataset, we recorded each article's timestamp and the name of the author, if available. Storing author names creates the potential to examine the relationship between the gender of the author and the gender of the subject, such as asking if there are differences between how women write about men and how men write about men. In this work, we did not yet pursue this direction because we wanted to begin with a simpler question of how gender is discussed: regardless of the gender of the authors, what is the content being put forth and consumed? Furthermore, we were unable to extract author gender in the professor dataset since the RMP reviews are anonymous. However, in future work, we may explore the influence of author gender in the celebrity dataset.\nFor the professor dataset, we captured metadata such as each review's rating, which indicates how the student feels about the professor on a scale of AWFUL to AWESOME. This additional variable in our data creates the option in future work to factor in sentiment; for example, we could study whether there are differences in language used when criticizing a female versus a male professor.\nOur first goal was to discover words that are significantly associated with men or women in a given domain. We employed an approach used by BIBREF10 in their work to analyze differences in how men and women write on Twitter.\nFirst, to operationalize, we say that term $i$ is associated with gender $j$ if, when discussing individuals of gender $j$, $i$ is used with unusual frequency \u2013 which we can check with statistical hypothesis tests. Let $f_i$ represent the likelihood of $i$ appearing when discussing women or men. $f_i$ is unknown, but we can model the distribution of all possible $f_i$ using the corpus of texts that we have from the domain. We construct a gender-balanced version of the corpus by randomly undersampling the more prevalent gender until the proportions of each gender are equal. Assuming a non-informative prior distribution on $f_i$, the posterior distribution is Beta($k_i$, $N - k_i$), where $k_i$ is the count of $i$ in the gender-balanced corpus and $N$ is the total count of words in that corpus.\nAs BIBREF10 discuss, \u201cthe distribution of the gender-specific counts can be described by an integral over all possible $f_i$. This integral defines the Beta-Binomial distribution BIBREF29, and has a closed form solution.\u201d We say that term $i$ is significantly associated with gender $j$ if the cumulative distribution at $k_{ij}$ (the count of $i$ in the $j$ portion of the gender-balanced corpus) is $p \\le 0.05$. As in the original work, we apply the Bonferroni correction BIBREF30 for multiple comparisons because we are computing statistical tests for thousands of hypotheses.\nWe applied this method to discover gender-associated words in both domains. In Table TABREF9, we present a sample of the most gender-associated nouns from the celebrity domain. Several themes emerge: for example, female celebrities seem to be more associated with appearance (\u201cgown,\u201d \u201cphoto,\u201d \u201chair,\u201d \u201clook\u201d), while male celebrities are more associated with creating content (\u201cmovie,\u201d \u201cfilm,\u201d \u201chost,\u201d \u201cdirector\u201d). This echoes real-world trends: for instance, on the red carpet, actresses tend to be asked more questions about their appearance \u2013- what brands they are wearing, how long it took to get ready, etc. \u2013- while actors are asked questions about their careers and creative processes (as an example, see BIBREF31).\nTable TABREF9 also includes some of the most gender-associated verbs and adjectives from the professor domain. Female CS professors seem to be praised for being communicative and personal with students (\u201crespond,\u201d \u201ccommunicate,\u201d \u201ckind,\u201d \u201ccaring\u201d), while male CS professors are recognized for being knowledgeable and challenging the students (\u201cteach,\u201d, \u201cchallenge,\u201d \u201cbrilliant,\u201d \u201cpractical\u201d). These trends are well-supported by social science literature, which has found that female teachers are praised for \u201cpersonalizing\u201d instruction and interacting extensively with students, while male teachers are praised for using \u201cteacher as expert\u201d styles that showcase mastery of material BIBREF32.\nThese findings establish that there are clear differences in how people talk about women and men \u2013 even with Bonferroni correction, there are still over 500 significantly gender-associated nouns, verbs, and adjectives in the celebrity domain and over 200 in the professor domain. Furthermore, the results in both domains align with prior studies and real world trends, which validates that our methods can capture meaningful patterns and innovatively provide evidence at the large-scale. This analysis also hints that it can be helpful to abstract from words to topics to recognize higher-level patterns of gender associations, which motivates our next section on clustering.\nWith word-level associations in hand, our next goals were to discover coherent clusters among the words and to automatically label those clusters.\nFirst, we trained domain-specific word embeddings using the Word2Vec BIBREF33 CBOW model ($w \\in R^{100}$). Then, we used k-means clustering to cluster the embeddings of the gender-associated words. Since k-means may converge at local optima, we ran the algorithm 50 times and kept the model with the lowest sum of squared errors.\nTo automatically label the clusters, we combined the grounded knowledge of WordNet BIBREF34 and context-sensitive strengths of domain-specific word embeddings. Our algorithm is similar to BIBREF28's approach, but we extend their method by introducing domain-specific word embeddings for clustering as well as a new technique for sense disambiguation. Given a cluster, our algorithm proceeds with the following three steps:\nSense disambiguation: The goal is to assign each cluster word to one of its WordNet synsets; let $S$ represent the collection of chosen synsets. We know that these words have been clustered in domain-specific embedding space, which means that in the context of the domain, these words are very close semantically. Thus, we choose $S^*$ that minimizes the total distance between its synsets.\nCandidate label generation: In this step, we generate $L$, the set of possible cluster labels. Our approach is simple: we take the union of all hypernyms of the synsets in $S^*$.\nCandidate label ranking: Here, we rank the synsets in $L$. We want labels that are as close to all of the synsets in $S^*$ as possible; thus, we score the candidate labels by the sum of their distances to each synset in $S^*$ and we rank them from least to most distance.\nIn steps 1 and 3, we use WordNet pathwise distance, but we encourage the exploration of other distance representations as well.\nTable TABREF11 displays a sample of our results \u2013 we find that the clusters are coherent in context and the labels seem reasonable. In the next section, we discuss human evaluations that we conducted to more rigorously evaluate the output, but first we discuss the value of these methods toward analysis.\nAt the word-level, we hypothesized that in the celebrity domain, women were more associated with appearance and men with creating content. Now, we can validate those hypotheses against labeled clusters \u2013 indeed, there is a cluster labeled clothing that is 100% female (i.e. 100% words are female-associated), and a 80% male cluster labeled movie. Likewise, in the professor domain, we had guessed that women are associated with communication and men with knowledge, and there is a 100% female cluster labeled communication and a 89% male cluster labeled cognition. Thus, cluster labeling proves to be very effective at pulling out the patterns that we believed we saw at the word-level, but could not formally validate.\nThe clusters we mentioned so far all lean heavily toward one gender association or the other, but some clusters are interesting precisely because they do not lean heavily \u2013 this allows us to see where semantic groupings do not align exactly with gender association. For example, in the celebrity domain, there is a cluster labeled lover that has a mix of female-associated words (\u201cboyfriend,\u201d \u201cbeau,\u201d \u201chubby\u201d) and male-associated words (\u201cwife,\u201d \u201cgirlfriend\u201d). Jointly leveraging cluster labels and gender associations allows us to see that in the semantic context of having a lover, women are typically associated with male figures and men with female figures, which reflects heteronormativity in society.\nTo test our clusters, we employed the Word Intrusion task BIBREF35. We present the annotator with five words \u2013 four drawn from one cluster and one drawn randomly from the domain vocabulary \u2013 and we ask them to pick out the intruder. The intuition is that if the cluster is coherent, then an observer should be able to identify the out-of-cluster word as the intruder. For both domains, we report results on all clusters and on the top 8, ranked by ascending normalized sum of squared errors, which can be seen as a prediction of coherence. In the celebrity domain, annotators identified the out-of-cluster word 73% of the time in the top-8 and 53% overall. In the professor domain, annotators identified it 60% of the time in the top-8 and 49% overall. As expected, top-8 performance in both domains does considerably better than overall, but at all levels the precision is significantly above the random baseline of 20%.\nTo test cluster labels, we present the annotator with a label and a word, and we ask them whether the word falls under the concept. The concept is a potential cluster label and the word is either a word from that cluster or drawn randomly from the domain vocabulary. For a good label, the rate at which in-cluster words fall under the label should be much higher than the rate at which out-of-cluster words fall under. In our experiments, we tested the top 4 predicted labels and the centroid of the cluster as a strong baseline label. The centroid achieved an in-cluster rate of .60 and out-of-cluster rate of .18 (difference of .42). Our best performing predicted label achieved an in-cluster rate of .65 and an out-of-cluster rate of .04 (difference of .61), thus outperforming the centroid on both rates and increasing the gap between rates by nearly 20 points. In the Appendix, we include more detailed results on both tasks.\nWe have presented two substantial datasets and a novel integration of methods to automatically infer gender associations in language. We have demonstrated that in both datasets, there are clear differences in how people talk about women and men. Furthermore, we have shown that clustering and cluster labeling are effective at identifying higher-level patterns of gender associations, and that our methods outperform strong baselines in human evaluations. In future work, we hope to use our findings to improve performance on tasks such as abusive language detection. We also hope to delve into finer-grained analyses, exploring how language around gender interacts with other variables, such as sexual orientation or profession (e.g. actresses versus female athletes). Finally, we plan to continue widening the scope of our study \u2013 for example, expanding our methods to include non-binary gender identities, evaluating changes in gender norms over time, and spreading to more domains, such as the political sphere.", "question": "How do they decide what is the semantic concept label of particular cluster?", "expected_output": "Given a cluster, our algorithm proceeds with the following three steps:\n\nSense disambiguation: The goal is to assign each cluster word to one of its WordNet synsets; let $S$ represent the collection of chosen synsets.

This method was simple but effective, since pronouns in the introduction almost always resolve to the subject of that page. In fact, on a sample of 80 tags that we manually annotated, we found that comparing pronoun counts predicted gender with perfect accuracy. Finally, if an article tagged at least one woman and did not tag any men, we labeled the article as Female; in the opposite case, we labeled it as Male.\nOur second dataset contains reviews from RateMyProfessors (RMP), an online platform where students can review their professors.

As in the original work, we apply the Bonferroni correction BIBREF30 for multiple comparisons because we are computing statistical tests for thousands of hypotheses.\nWe applied this method to discover gender-associated words in both domains. In Table TABREF9, we present a sample of the most gender-associated nouns from the celebrity domain. Several themes emerge: for example, female celebrities seem to be more associated with appearance (\u201cgown,\u201d \u201cphoto,\u201d \u201chair,\u201d \u201clook\u201d), while male celebrities are more associated with creating content (\u201cmovie,\u201d \u201cfilm,\u201d \u201chost,\u201d \u201cdirector\u201d). This echoes real-world trends: for instance, on the red carpet, actresses tend to be asked more questions about their appearance \u2013- what brands they are wearing, how long it took to get ready, etc. \u2013- while actors are asked questions about their careers and creative processes (as an example, see BIBREF31).\nTable TABREF9 also includes some of the most gender-associated verbs and adjectives from the professor domain. Female CS professors seem to be praised for being communicative and personal with students (\u201crespond,\u201d \u201ccommunicate,\u201d \u201ckind,\u201d \u201ccaring\u201d), while male CS professors are recognized for being knowledgeable and challenging the students (\u201cteach,\u201d, \u201cchallenge,\u201d \u201cbrilliant,\u201d \u201cpractical\u201d).

Furthermore, the results in both domains align with prior studies and real world trends, which validates that our methods can capture meaningful patterns and innovatively provide evidence at the large-scale. This analysis also hints that it can be helpful to abstract from words to topics to recognize higher-level patterns of gender associations, which motivates our next section on clustering.\nWith word-level associations in hand, our next goals were to discover coherent clusters among the words and to automatically label those clusters.\nFirst, we trained domain-specific word embeddings using the Word2Vec BIBREF33 CBOW model ($w \\in R^{100}$).

Thus, we choose $S^*$ that minimizes the total distance between its synsets.\nCandidate label generation: In this step, we generate $L$, the set of possible cluster labels. Our approach is simple: we take the union of all hypernyms of the synsets in $S^*$.\nCandidate label ranking: Here, we rank the synsets in $L$. We want labels that are as close to all of the synsets in $S^*$ as possible; thus, we score the candidate labels by the sum of their distances to each synset in $S^*$ and we rank them from least to most distance.\nIn steps 1 and 3, we use WordNet pathwise distance, but we encourage the exploration of other distance representations as well.\nTable TABREF11 displays a sample of our results \u2013 we find that the clusters are coherent in context and the labels seem reasonable. In the next section, we discuss human evaluations that we conducted to more rigorously evaluate the output, but first we discuss the value of these methods toward analysis.\nAt the word-level, we hypothesized that in the celebrity domain, women were more associated with appearance and men with creating content. Now, we can validate those hypotheses against labeled clusters \u2013 indeed, there is a cluster labeled clothing that is 100% female (i.e. 100% words are female-associated), and a 80% male cluster labeled movie. Likewise, in the professor domain, we had guessed that women are associated with communication and men with knowledge, and there is a 100% female cluster labeled communication and a 89% male cluster labeled cognition. Thus, cluster labeling proves to be very effective at pulling out the patterns that we believed we saw at the word-level, but could not formally validate.\nThe clusters we mentioned so far all lean heavily toward one gender association or the other, but some clusters are interesting precisely because they do not lean heavily \u2013 this allows us to see where semantic groupings do not align exactly with gender association. For example, in the celebrity domain, there is a cluster labeled lover that has a mix of female-associated words (\u201cboyfriend,\u201d \u201cbeau,\u201d \u201chubby\u201d) and male-associated words (\u201cwife,\u201d \u201cgirlfriend\u201d). Jointly leveraging cluster labels and gender associations allows us to see that in the semantic context of having a lover, women are typically associated with male figures and men with female figures, which reflects heteronormativity in society.\nTo test our clusters, we employed the Word Intrusion task BIBREF35. We present the annotator with five words \u2013 four drawn from one cluster and one drawn randomly from the domain vocabulary \u2013 and we ask them to pick out the intruder. The intuition is that if the cluster is coherent, then an observer should be able to identify the out-of-cluster word as the intruder. For both domains, we report results on all clusters and on the top 8, ranked by ascending normalized sum of squared errors, which can be seen as a prediction of coherence. In the celebrity domain, annotators identified the out-of-cluster word 73% of the time in the top-8 and 53% overall. In the professor domain, annotators identified it 60% of the time in the top-8 and 49% overall. As expected, top-8 performance in both domains does considerably better than overall, but at all levels the precision is significantly above the random baseline of 20%.\nTo test cluster labels, we present the annotator with a label and a word, and we ask them whether the word falls under the concept. The concept is a potential cluster label and the word is either a word from that cluster or drawn randomly from the domain vocabulary. For a good label, the rate at which in-cluster words fall under the label should be much higher than the rate at which out-of-cluster words fall under. In our experiments, we tested the top 4 predicted labels and the centroid of the cluster as a strong baseline label. The centroid achieved an in-cluster rate of .60 and out-of-cluster rate of .18 (difference of .42). Our best performing predicted label achieved an in-cluster rate of .65 and an out-of-cluster rate of .04 (difference of .61), thus outperforming the centroid on both rates and increasing the gap between rates by nearly 20 points. In the Appendix, we include more detailed results on both tasks.\nWe have presented two substantial datasets and a novel integration of methods to automatically infer gender associations in language. We have demonstrated that in both datasets, there are clear differences in how people talk about women and men. Furthermore, we have shown that clustering and cluster labeling are effective at identifying higher-level patterns of gender associations, and that our methods outperform strong baselines in human evaluations. In future work, we hope to use our findings to improve performance on tasks such as abusive language detection. We also hope to delve into finer-grained analyses, exploring how language around gender interacts with other variables, such as sexual orientation or profession (e.g. actresses versus female athletes).

{"id": "1909.00091", "prompt": "It is well-established that gender bias exists in language \u2013 for example, we see evidence of this given the prevalence of sexism in abusive language datasets BIBREF0, BIBREF1. However, these are extreme cases of gender norms in language, and only encompass a small proportion of speakers or texts.\nLess studied in NLP is how gender norms manifest in everyday language \u2013 do people talk about women and men in different ways? These types of differences are far subtler than abusive language, but they can provide valuable insight into the roots of more extreme acts of discrimination. Subtle differences are difficult to observe because each case on its own could be attributed to circumstance, a passing comment or an accidental word. However, at the level of hundreds of thousands of data points, these patterns, if they do exist, become undeniable. Thus, in this work, we introduce new datasets and methods so that we can study subtle gender associations in language at the large-scale.\nOur contributions include:\nTwo datasets for studying language and gender, each consisting of over 300K sentences.\nMethods to infer gender-associated words and labeled clusters in any domain.\nNovel findings that demonstrate in both domains that people do talk about women and men in different ways.\nEach contribution brings us closer to modeling how gender associations appear in everyday language. In the remainder of the paper, we present related work, our data collection, methods and findings, and human evaluations of our system.\nThe study of gender and language has a rich history in social science. Its roots are often attributed to Robin Lakoff, who argued that language is fundamental to gender inequality, \u201creflected in both the ways women are expected to speak, and the ways in which women are spoken of\u201d BIBREF2. Prominent scholars following Lakoff have included Deborah Tannen BIBREF3, Mary Bucholtz and Kira Hall BIBREF4, Janet Holmes BIBREF5, Penelope Eckert BIBREF6, and Deborah Cameron BIBREF7, along with many others.\nIn recent decades, the study of gender and language has also attracted computational researchers. Echoing Lakoff's original claim, a popular strand of computational work focuses on differences in how women and men talk, analyzing key lexical traits BIBREF8, BIBREF9, BIBREF10 and predicting a person's gender from some text they have written BIBREF11, BIBREF12. There is also research studying how people talk to women and men BIBREF13, as well as how people talk about women and men, typically in specific domains such as sports journalism BIBREF14, fiction writing BIBREF15, movie scripts BIBREF16, and Wikipedia biographies BIBREF17, BIBREF18. Our work builds on this body by diving into two novel domains: celebrity news, which explores gender in pop culture, and student reviews of CS professors, which examines gender in academia and, particularly, the historically male-dominated field of CS. Furthermore, many of these works rely on manually constructed lexicons or topics to pinpoint gendered language, but our methods automatically infer gender-associated words and labeled clusters, thus reducing supervision and increasing the potential to discover subtleties in the data.\nModeling gender associations in language could also be instrumental to other NLP tasks. Abusive language is often founded in sexism BIBREF0, BIBREF1, so models of gender associations could help to improve detection in those cases. Gender bias also manifests in NLP pipelines: prior research has found that word embeddings preserve gender biases BIBREF19, BIBREF20, BIBREF21, and some have developed methods to reduce this bias BIBREF22, BIBREF23. Yet, the problem is far from solved; for example, BIBREF24 showed that it is still possible to recover gender bias from \u201cde-biased\u201d embeddings. These findings further motivate our research, since before we can fully reduce gender bias in embeddings, we need to develop a deeper understanding of how gender permeates through language in the first place.\nWe also build on methods to cluster words in word embedding space and automatically label clusters. Clustering word embeddings has proven useful for discovering salient patterns in text corpora BIBREF25, BIBREF26. Once clusters are derived, we would like them to be interpretable. Much research simply considers the top-n words from each cluster, but this method can be subjective and time-consuming to interpret. Thus, there are efforts to design methods of automatic cluster labeling BIBREF27. We take a similar approach to BIBREF28, who leverage word embeddings and WordNet during labeling, and we extend their method with additional techniques and evaluations.\nOur first dataset contains articles from celebrity magazines People, UsWeekly, and E!News. We labeled each article for whether it was reporting on men, women, or neither/unknown. To do this, we first extracted the article's topic tags. Some of these tags referred to people, but others to non-people entities, such as \u201cGift Ideas\u201d or \u201cHealth.\u201d To distinguish between these types of tags, we queried each tag on Wikipedia and checked whether the top page result contained a \u201cBorn\u201d entry in its infobox \u2013 if so, we concluded that the tag referred to a person.\nThen, from the person's Wikipedia page, we determined their gender by checking whether the introductory paragraphs of the page contained more male or female pronouns. This method was simple but effective, since pronouns in the introduction almost always resolve to the subject of that page. In fact, on a sample of 80 tags that we manually annotated, we found that comparing pronoun counts predicted gender with perfect accuracy. Finally, if an article tagged at least one woman and did not tag any men, we labeled the article as Female; in the opposite case, we labeled it as Male.\nOur second dataset contains reviews from RateMyProfessors (RMP), an online platform where students can review their professors. We included all 5,604 U.S. schools on RMP, and collected all reviews for CS professors at those schools. We labeled each review with the gender of the professor whom it was about, which we determined by comparing the count of male versus female pronouns over all reviews for that professor. This method was again effective, because the reviews are expressly written about a certain professor, so the pronouns typically resolve to that professor.\nIn addition to extracting the text of the articles or reviews, for each dataset we also collected various useful metadata. For the celebrity dataset, we recorded each article's timestamp and the name of the author, if available. Storing author names creates the potential to examine the relationship between the gender of the author and the gender of the subject, such as asking if there are differences between how women write about men and how men write about men. In this work, we did not yet pursue this direction because we wanted to begin with a simpler question of how gender is discussed: regardless of the gender of the authors, what is the content being put forth and consumed? Furthermore, we were unable to extract author gender in the professor dataset since the RMP reviews are anonymous. However, in future work, we may explore the influence of author gender in the celebrity dataset.\nFor the professor dataset, we captured metadata such as each review's rating, which indicates how the student feels about the professor on a scale of AWFUL to AWESOME. This additional variable in our data creates the option in future work to factor in sentiment; for example, we could study whether there are differences in language used when criticizing a female versus a male professor.\nOur first goal was to discover words that are significantly associated with men or women in a given domain. We employed an approach used by BIBREF10 in their work to analyze differences in how men and women write on Twitter.\nFirst, to operationalize, we say that term $i$ is associated with gender $j$ if, when discussing individuals of gender $j$, $i$ is used with unusual frequency \u2013 which we can check with statistical hypothesis tests. Let $f_i$ represent the likelihood of $i$ appearing when discussing women or men. $f_i$ is unknown, but we can model the distribution of all possible $f_i$ using the corpus of texts that we have from the domain. We construct a gender-balanced version of the corpus by randomly undersampling the more prevalent gender until the proportions of each gender are equal. Assuming a non-informative prior distribution on $f_i$, the posterior distribution is Beta($k_i$, $N - k_i$), where $k_i$ is the count of $i$ in the gender-balanced corpus and $N$ is the total count of words in that corpus.\nAs BIBREF10 discuss, \u201cthe distribution of the gender-specific counts can be described by an integral over all possible $f_i$. This integral defines the Beta-Binomial distribution BIBREF29, and has a closed form solution.\u201d We say that term $i$ is significantly associated with gender $j$ if the cumulative distribution at $k_{ij}$ (the count of $i$ in the $j$ portion of the gender-balanced corpus) is $p \\le 0.05$. As in the original work, we apply the Bonferroni correction BIBREF30 for multiple comparisons because we are computing statistical tests for thousands of hypotheses.\nWe applied this method to discover gender-associated words in both domains. In Table TABREF9, we present a sample of the most gender-associated nouns from the celebrity domain. Several themes emerge: for example, female celebrities seem to be more associated with appearance (\u201cgown,\u201d \u201cphoto,\u201d \u201chair,\u201d \u201clook\u201d), while male celebrities are more associated with creating content (\u201cmovie,\u201d \u201cfilm,\u201d \u201chost,\u201d \u201cdirector\u201d). This echoes real-world trends: for instance, on the red carpet, actresses tend to be asked more questions about their appearance \u2013- what brands they are wearing, how long it took to get ready, etc. \u2013- while actors are asked questions about their careers and creative processes (as an example, see BIBREF31).\nTable TABREF9 also includes some of the most gender-associated verbs and adjectives from the professor domain. Female CS professors seem to be praised for being communicative and personal with students (\u201crespond,\u201d \u201ccommunicate,\u201d \u201ckind,\u201d \u201ccaring\u201d), while male CS professors are recognized for being knowledgeable and challenging the students (\u201cteach,\u201d, \u201cchallenge,\u201d \u201cbrilliant,\u201d \u201cpractical\u201d). These trends are well-supported by social science literature, which has found that female teachers are praised for \u201cpersonalizing\u201d instruction and interacting extensively with students, while male teachers are praised for using \u201cteacher as expert\u201d styles that showcase mastery of material BIBREF32.\nThese findings establish that there are clear differences in how people talk about women and men \u2013 even with Bonferroni correction, there are still over 500 significantly gender-associated nouns, verbs, and adjectives in the celebrity domain and over 200 in the professor domain. Furthermore, the results in both domains align with prior studies and real world trends, which validates that our methods can capture meaningful patterns and innovatively provide evidence at the large-scale. This analysis also hints that it can be helpful to abstract from words to topics to recognize higher-level patterns of gender associations, which motivates our next section on clustering.\nWith word-level associations in hand, our next goals were to discover coherent clusters among the words and to automatically label those clusters.\nFirst, we trained domain-specific word embeddings using the Word2Vec BIBREF33 CBOW model ($w \\in R^{100}$). Then, we used k-means clustering to cluster the embeddings of the gender-associated words. Since k-means may converge at local optima, we ran the algorithm 50 times and kept the model with the lowest sum of squared errors.\nTo automatically label the clusters, we combined the grounded knowledge of WordNet BIBREF34 and context-sensitive strengths of domain-specific word embeddings. Our algorithm is similar to BIBREF28's approach, but we extend their method by introducing domain-specific word embeddings for clustering as well as a new technique for sense disambiguation. Given a cluster, our algorithm proceeds with the following three steps:\nSense disambiguation: The goal is to assign each cluster word to one of its WordNet synsets; let $S$ represent the collection of chosen synsets. We know that these words have been clustered in domain-specific embedding space, which means that in the context of the domain, these words are very close semantically. Thus, we choose $S^*$ that minimizes the total distance between its synsets.\nCandidate label generation: In this step, we generate $L$, the set of possible cluster labels. Our approach is simple: we take the union of all hypernyms of the synsets in $S^*$.\nCandidate label ranking: Here, we rank the synsets in $L$. We want labels that are as close to all of the synsets in $S^*$ as possible; thus, we score the candidate labels by the sum of their distances to each synset in $S^*$ and we rank them from least to most distance.\nIn steps 1 and 3, we use WordNet pathwise distance, but we encourage the exploration of other distance representations as well.\nTable TABREF11 displays a sample of our results \u2013 we find that the clusters are coherent in context and the labels seem reasonable. In the next section, we discuss human evaluations that we conducted to more rigorously evaluate the output, but first we discuss the value of these methods toward analysis.\nAt the word-level, we hypothesized that in the celebrity domain, women were more associated with appearance and men with creating content. Now, we can validate those hypotheses against labeled clusters \u2013 indeed, there is a cluster labeled clothing that is 100% female (i.e. 100% words are female-associated), and a 80% male cluster labeled movie. Likewise, in the professor domain, we had guessed that women are associated with communication and men with knowledge, and there is a 100% female cluster labeled communication and a 89% male cluster labeled cognition. Thus, cluster labeling proves to be very effective at pulling out the patterns that we believed we saw at the word-level, but could not formally validate.\nThe clusters we mentioned so far all lean heavily toward one gender association or the other, but some clusters are interesting precisely because they do not lean heavily \u2013 this allows us to see where semantic groupings do not align exactly with gender association. For example, in the celebrity domain, there is a cluster labeled lover that has a mix of female-associated words (\u201cboyfriend,\u201d \u201cbeau,\u201d \u201chubby\u201d) and male-associated words (\u201cwife,\u201d \u201cgirlfriend\u201d). Jointly leveraging cluster labels and gender associations allows us to see that in the semantic context of having a lover, women are typically associated with male figures and men with female figures, which reflects heteronormativity in society.\nTo test our clusters, we employed the Word Intrusion task BIBREF35. We present the annotator with five words \u2013 four drawn from one cluster and one drawn randomly from the domain vocabulary \u2013 and we ask them to pick out the intruder. The intuition is that if the cluster is coherent, then an observer should be able to identify the out-of-cluster word as the intruder. For both domains, we report results on all clusters and on the top 8, ranked by ascending normalized sum of squared errors, which can be seen as a prediction of coherence. In the celebrity domain, annotators identified the out-of-cluster word 73% of the time in the top-8 and 53% overall.

Female CS professors seem to be praised for being communicative and personal with students (\u201crespond,\u201d \u201ccommunicate,\u201d \u201ckind,\u201d \u201ccaring\u201d), while male CS professors are recognized for being knowledgeable and challenging the students (\u201cteach,\u201d, \u201cchallenge,\u201d \u201cbrilliant,\u201d \u201cpractical\u201d). These trends are well-supported by social science literature, which has found that female teachers are praised for \u201cpersonalizing\u201d instruction and interacting extensively with students, while male teachers are praised for using \u201cteacher as expert\u201d styles that showcase mastery of material BIBREF32.\nThese findings establish that there are clear differences in how people talk about women and men \u2013 even with Bonferroni correction, there are still over 500 significantly gender-associated nouns, verbs, and adjectives in the celebrity domain and over 200 in the professor domain. Furthermore, the results in both domains align with prior studies and real world trends, which validates that our methods can capture meaningful patterns and innovatively provide evidence at the large-scale. This analysis also hints that it can be helpful to abstract from words to topics to recognize higher-level patterns of gender associations, which motivates our next section on clustering.\nWith word-level associations in hand, our next goals were to discover coherent clusters among the words and to automatically label those clusters.\nFirst, we trained domain-specific word embeddings using the Word2Vec BIBREF33 CBOW model ($w \\in R^{100}$). Then, we used k-means clustering to cluster the embeddings of the gender-associated words. Since k-means may converge at local optima, we ran the algorithm 50 times and kept the model with the lowest sum of squared errors.\nTo automatically label the clusters, we combined the grounded knowledge of WordNet BIBREF34 and context-sensitive strengths of domain-specific word embeddings. Our algorithm is similar to BIBREF28's approach, but we extend their method by introducing domain-specific word embeddings for clustering as well as a new technique for sense disambiguation. Given a cluster, our algorithm proceeds with the following three steps:\nSense disambiguation: The goal is to assign each cluster word to one of its WordNet synsets; let $S$ represent the collection of chosen synsets. We know that these words have been clustered in domain-specific embedding space, which means that in the context of the domain, these words are very close semantically. Thus, we choose $S^*$ that minimizes the total distance between its synsets.\nCandidate label generation: In this step, we generate $L$, the set of possible cluster labels. Our approach is simple: we take the union of all hypernyms of the synsets in $S^*$.\nCandidate label ranking: Here, we rank the synsets in $L$. We want labels that are as close to all of the synsets in $S^*$ as possible; thus, we score the candidate labels by the sum of their distances to each synset in $S^*$ and we rank them from least to most distance.\nIn steps 1 and 3, we use WordNet pathwise distance, but we encourage the exploration of other distance representations as well.\nTable TABREF11 displays a sample of our results \u2013 we find that the clusters are coherent in context and the labels seem reasonable. In the next section, we discuss human evaluations that we conducted to more rigorously evaluate the output, but first we discuss the value of these methods toward analysis.\nAt the word-level, we hypothesized that in the celebrity domain, women were more associated with appearance and men with creating content. Now, we can validate those hypotheses against labeled clusters \u2013 indeed, there is a cluster labeled clothing that is 100% female (i.e. 100% words are female-associated), and a 80% male cluster labeled movie. Likewise, in the professor domain, we had guessed that women are associated with communication and men with knowledge, and there is a 100% female cluster labeled communication and a 89% male cluster labeled cognition. Thus, cluster labeling proves to be very effective at pulling out the patterns that we believed we saw at the word-level, but could not formally validate.\nThe clusters we mentioned so far all lean heavily toward one gender association or the other, but some clusters are interesting precisely because they do not lean heavily \u2013 this allows us to see where semantic groupings do not align exactly with gender association. For example, in the celebrity domain, there is a cluster labeled lover that has a mix of female-associated words (\u201cboyfriend,\u201d \u201cbeau,\u201d \u201chubby\u201d) and male-associated words (\u201cwife,\u201d \u201cgirlfriend\u201d). Jointly leveraging cluster labels and gender associations allows us to see that in the semantic context of having a lover, women are typically associated with male figures and men with female figures, which reflects heteronormativity in society.\nTo test our clusters, we employed the Word Intrusion task BIBREF35. We present the annotator with five words \u2013 four drawn from one cluster and one drawn randomly from the domain vocabulary \u2013 and we ask them to pick out the intruder. The intuition is that if the cluster is coherent, then an observer should be able to identify the out-of-cluster word as the intruder. For both domains, we report results on all clusters and on the top 8, ranked by ascending normalized sum of squared errors, which can be seen as a prediction of coherence. In the celebrity domain, annotators identified the out-of-cluster word 73% of the time in the top-8 and 53% overall. In the professor domain, annotators identified it 60% of the time in the top-8 and 49% overall. As expected, top-8 performance in both domains does considerably better than overall, but at all levels the precision is significantly above the random baseline of 20%.\nTo test cluster labels, we present the annotator with a label and a word, and we ask them whether the word falls under the concept. The concept is a potential cluster label and the word is either a word from that cluster or drawn randomly from the domain vocabulary. For a good label, the rate at which in-cluster words fall under the label should be much higher than the rate at which out-of-cluster words fall under. In our experiments, we tested the top 4 predicted labels and the centroid of the cluster as a strong baseline label. The centroid achieved an in-cluster rate of .60 and out-of-cluster rate of .18 (difference of .42). Our best performing predicted label achieved an in-cluster rate of .65 and an out-of-cluster rate of .04 (difference of .61), thus outperforming the centroid on both rates and increasing the gap between rates by nearly 20 points. In the Appendix, we include more detailed results on both tasks.\nWe have presented two substantial datasets and a novel integration of methods to automatically infer gender associations in language. We have demonstrated that in both datasets, there are clear differences in how people talk about women and men. Furthermore, we have shown that clustering and cluster labeling are effective at identifying higher-level patterns of gender associations, and that our methods outperform strong baselines in human evaluations. In future work, we hope to use our findings to improve performance on tasks such as abusive language detection. We also hope to delve into finer-grained analyses, exploring how language around gender interacts with other variables, such as sexual orientation or profession (e.g. actresses versus female athletes). Finally, we plan to continue widening the scope of our study \u2013 for example, expanding our methods to include non-binary gender identities, evaluating changes in gender norms over time, and spreading to more domains, such as the political sphere.", "question": "What are strong baselines authors used?", "expected_output": "The authors contrasted human evaluations against a random baseline, and used the centroid of the cluster as a strong baseline..

{"id": "1909.04387", "prompt": "Ethical challenges related to dialogue systems and conversational agents raise novel research questions, such as learning from biased data sets BIBREF0, and how to handle verbal abuse from the user's side BIBREF1, BIBREF2, BIBREF3, BIBREF4. As highlighted by a recent UNESCO report BIBREF5, appropriate responses to abusive queries are vital to prevent harmful gender biases: the often submissive and flirty responses by the female-gendered systems reinforce ideas of women as subservient. In this paper, we investigate the appropriateness of possible strategies by gathering responses from current state-of-the-art systems and ask crowd-workers to rate them.\nWe first gather abusive utterances from 600K conversations with US-based customers. We search for relevant utterances by simple keyword spotting and find that about 5% of the corpus includes abuse, with mostly sexually explicit utterances. Previous research reports even higher levels of abuse between 11% BIBREF2 and 30% BIBREF6. Since we are not allowed to directly quote from our corpus in order to protect customer rights, we summarise the data to a total of 109 \u201cprototypical\" utterances - substantially extending the previous dataset of 35 utterances from Amanda:EthicsNLP2018 - and categorise these utterances based on the Linguistic Society's definition of sexual harassment BIBREF7:\n[noitemsep]\nGender and Sexuality, e.g. \u201cAre you gay?\u201d, \u201cHow do you have sex?\u201d\nSexualised Comments, e.g. \u201cI love watching porn.\u201d, \u201cI'm horny.\u201d\nSexualised Insults, e.g. \u201cStupid bitch.\u201d, \u201cWhore\u201d\nSexual Requests and Demands, e.g. \u201cWill you have sex with me?\u201d, \u201cTalk dirty to me.\u201d\nWe then use these prompts to elicit responses from the following systems, following methodology from Amanda:EthicsNLP2018.\n[leftmargin=5mm, noitemsep]\n4 Commercial: Amazon Alexa, Apple Siri, Google Home, Microsoft's Cortana.\n4 Non-commercial rule-based: E.L.I.Z.A.

If this was the case, we included all responses in the study. Following this methodology, we collected a total of 2441 system replies in July-August 2018 - 3.5 times more data than Amanda:EthicsNLP2018 - which 2 expert annotators manually annotated according to the categories in Table TABREF14 ($\\kappa =0.66$).\nIn order to assess the perceived appropriateness of system responses we conduct a human study using crowd-sourcing on the FigureEight platform. We define appropriateness as \u201cacceptable behaviour in a work environment\u201d and the participants were made aware that the conversations took place between a human and a system. Ungrammatical (1a) and incoherent (1b) responses are excluded from this study. We collect appropriateness ratings given a stimulus (the prompt) and four randomly sampled responses from our corpus that the worker is to label following the methodology described in BIBREF21, where each utterance is rated relatively to a reference on a user-defined scale. Ratings are then normalised on a scale from [0-1]. This methodology was shown to produce more reliable user ratings than commonly used Likert Scales. In addition, we collect demographic information, including gender and age group. In total we collected 9960 HITs from 472 crowd workers. In order to identify spammers and unsuitable ratings, we use the responses from the adult-only bots as test questions: We remove users who give high ratings to sexual bot responses the majority (more than 55%) of the time.18,826 scores remain - resulting in an average of 7.7 ratings per individual system reply and 1568.8 ratings per response type as listed in Table TABREF14.Due to missing demographic data - and after removing malicious crowdworkers - we only consider a subset of 190 raters for our demographic study. The group is composed of 130 men and 60 women. Most raters (62.6%) are under the age of 44, with similar proportions across age groups for men and women. This is in-line with our target population: 57% of users of smart speakers are male and the majority are under 44 BIBREF22.\nThe ranks and mean scores of response categories can be seen in Table TABREF29. Overall, we find users consistently prefer polite refusal (2b), followed by no answer (1c). Chastising (2d) and \u201cdon't know\" (1e) rank together at position 3, while flirting (3c) and retaliation (2e) rank lowest. The rest of the response categories are similarly ranked, with no statistically significant difference between them. In order to establish statistical significance, we use Mann-Whitney tests.\nPrevious research has shown gender to be the most important factor in predicting a person's definition of sexual harassment BIBREF23. However, we find small and not statistically significant differences in the overall rank given by users of different gender (see tab:ageresults).\nRegarding the user's age, we find strong differences between GenZ (18-25) raters and other groups. Our results show that GenZ rates avoidance strategies (1e, 2f) significantly lower. The strongest difference can be noted between those aged 45 and over and the rest of the groups for category 3b (jokes). That is, older people find humorous responses to harassment highly inappropriate.\nHere, we explore the hypothesis, that users perceive different responses as appropriate, dependent on the type and gravity of harassment, see Section SECREF2. The results in Table TABREF33 indeed show that perceived appropriateness varies significantly between prompt contexts. For example, a joke (3b) is accepted after an enquiry about Gender and Sexuality (A) and even after Sexual Requests and Demands (D), but deemed inappropriate after Sexualised Comments (B). Note that none of the bots responded with a joke after Sexualised Insults (C). Avoidance (2f) is considered most appropriate in the context of Sexualised Demands. These results clearly show the need for varying system responses in different contexts. However, the corpus study from Amanda:EthicsNLP2018 shows that current state-of-the-art systems do not adapt their responses sufficiently.\nFinally, we consider appropriateness per system. Following related work by BIBREF21, BIBREF24, we use Trueskill BIBREF25 to cluster systems into equivalently rated groups according to their partial relative rankings. The results in Table TABREF36 show that the highest rated systen is Alley, a purpose build bot for online language learning. Alley produces \u201cpolite refusal\u201d (2b) - the top ranked strategy - 31% of the time. Comparatively, commercial systems politely refuse only between 17% (Cortana) and 2% (Alexa). Most of the time commercial systems tend to \u201cplay along\u201d (3a), joke (3b) or don't know how to answer (1e) which tend to receive lower ratings, see Figure FIGREF38. Rule-based systems most often politely refuse to answer (2b), but also use medium ranked strategies, such as deflect (2c) or chastise (2d). For example, most of Eliza's responses fall under the \u201cdeflection\u201d strategy, such as \u201cWhy do you ask?\u201d. Data-driven systems rank low in general. Neuralconvo and Cleverbot are the only ones that ever politely refuse and we attribute their improved ratings to this. In turn, the \u201cclean\u201d seq2seq often produces responses which can be interpreted as flirtatious (44%), and ranks similarly to Annabelle Lee and Laurel Sweet, the only adult bots that politely refuses ( 16% of the time). Ritter:2010:UMT:1857999.1858019's IR approach is rated similarly to Capt Howdy and both produce a majority of retaliatory (2e) responses - 38% and 58% respectively - followed by flirtatious responses. Finally, Dr Love and Sophia69 produce almost exclusively flirtatious responses which are consistently ranked low by users.\nCrowdsourced user studies are widely used for related tasks, such as evaluating dialogue strategies, e.g. BIBREF26, and for eliciting a moral stance from a population BIBREF27. Our crowdsourced setup is similar to an \u201coverhearer experiment\u201d as e.g. conducted by Ma:2019:handlingChall where study participants were asked to rate the system's emotional competence after watching videos of challenging user behaviour. However, we believe that the ultimate measure for abuse mitigation should come from users interacting with the system. chin2019should make a first step into this direction by investigating different response styles (Avoidance, Empathy, Counterattacking) to verbal abuse, and recording the user's emotional reaction \u2013 hoping that eliciting certain emotions, such as guilt, will eventually stop the abuse. While we agree that stopping the abuse should be the ultimate goal, BIBREF28's study is limited in that participants were not genuine (ab)users, but instructed to abuse the system in a certain way. BIBREF29 report that a pilot using a similar setup let to unnatural interactions, which limits the conclusions we can draw about the effectiveness of abuse mitigation strategies. Our next step therefore is to employ our system with real users to test different mitigation strategies \u201cin the wild\" with the ultimate goal to find the best strategy to stop the abuse. The results of this current paper suggest that the strategy should be adaptive to user type/ age, as well as to the severity of abuse.\nThis paper presents the first user study on perceived appropriateness of system responses after verbal abuse. We put strategies used by state-of-the-art systems to the test in a large-scale, crowd-sourced evaluation. The full annotated corpus contains 2441 system replies, categorised into 14 response types, which were evaluated by 472 raters - resulting in 7.7 ratings per reply.\nOur results show that: (1) The user's age has an significant effect on the ratings. For example, older users find jokes as a response to harassment highly inappropriate. (2) Perceived appropriateness also depends on the type of previous abuse. For example, avoidance is most appropriate after sexual demands. (3) All system were rated significantly higher than our negative adult-only baselines - except two data-driven systems, one of which is a Seq2Seq model trained on \u201cclean\" data where all utterances containing abusive words were removed BIBREF1. This leads us to believe that data-driven response generation need more effective control mechanisms BIBREF30.\nWe would like to thank our colleagues Ruth Aylett and Arash Eshghi for their comments.

Our next step therefore is to employ our system with real users to test different mitigation strategies \u201cin the wild\" with the ultimate goal to find the best strategy to stop the abuse. The results of this current paper suggest that the strategy should be adaptive to user type/ age, as well as to the severity of abuse.\nThis paper presents the first user study on perceived appropriateness of system responses after verbal abuse. We put strategies used by state-of-the-art systems to the test in a large-scale, crowd-sourced evaluation. The full annotated corpus contains 2441 system replies, categorised into 14 response types, which were evaluated by 472 raters - resulting in 7.7 ratings per reply.\nOur results show that: (1) The user's age has an significant effect on the ratings. For example, older users find jokes as a response to harassment highly inappropriate. (2) Perceived appropriateness also depends on the type of previous abuse. For example, avoidance is most appropriate after sexual demands. (3) All system were rated significantly higher than our negative adult-only baselines - except two data-driven systems, one of which is a Seq2Seq model trained on \u201cclean\" data where all utterances containing abusive words were removed BIBREF1.

{"id": "1909.04387", "prompt": "Ethical challenges related to dialogue systems and conversational agents raise novel research questions, such as learning from biased data sets BIBREF0, and how to handle verbal abuse from the user's side BIBREF1, BIBREF2, BIBREF3, BIBREF4. As highlighted by a recent UNESCO report BIBREF5, appropriate responses to abusive queries are vital to prevent harmful gender biases: the often submissive and flirty responses by the female-gendered systems reinforce ideas of women as subservient. In this paper, we investigate the appropriateness of possible strategies by gathering responses from current state-of-the-art systems and ask crowd-workers to rate them.\nWe first gather abusive utterances from 600K conversations with US-based customers. We search for relevant utterances by simple keyword spotting and find that about 5% of the corpus includes abuse, with mostly sexually explicit utterances. Previous research reports even higher levels of abuse between 11% BIBREF2 and 30% BIBREF6. Since we are not allowed to directly quote from our corpus in order to protect customer rights, we summarise the data to a total of 109 \u201cprototypical\" utterances - substantially extending the previous dataset of 35 utterances from Amanda:EthicsNLP2018 - and categorise these utterances based on the Linguistic Society's definition of sexual harassment BIBREF7:\n[noitemsep]\nGender and Sexuality, e.g. \u201cAre you gay?\u201d, \u201cHow do you have sex?\u201d\nSexualised Comments, e.g. \u201cI love watching porn.\u201d, \u201cI'm horny.\u201d\nSexualised Insults, e.g. \u201cStupid bitch.\u201d, \u201cWhore\u201d\nSexual Requests and Demands, e.g. \u201cWill you have sex with me?\u201d, \u201cTalk dirty to me.\u201d\nWe then use these prompts to elicit responses from the following systems, following methodology from Amanda:EthicsNLP2018.\n[leftmargin=5mm, noitemsep]\n4 Commercial: Amazon Alexa, Apple Siri, Google Home, Microsoft's Cortana.\n4 Non-commercial rule-based: E.L.I.Z.A. BIBREF8, Parry BIBREF9, A.L.I.C.E. BIBREF10, Alley BIBREF11.\n4 Data-driven approaches:\nCleverbot BIBREF12;\nNeuralConvo BIBREF13, a re-implementation of BIBREF14;\nan implementation of BIBREF15's Information Retrieval approach;\na vanilla Seq2Seq model trained on clean Reddit data BIBREF1.\nNegative Baselines: We also compile responses by adult chatbots: Sophia69 BIBREF16, Laurel Sweet BIBREF17, Captain Howdy BIBREF18, Annabelle Lee BIBREF19, Dr Love BIBREF20.\nWe repeated the prompts multiple times to see if system responses varied and if defensiveness increased with continued abuse. If this was the case, we included all responses in the study. Following this methodology, we collected a total of 2441 system replies in July-August 2018 - 3.5 times more data than Amanda:EthicsNLP2018 - which 2 expert annotators manually annotated according to the categories in Table TABREF14 ($\\kappa =0.66$).\nIn order to assess the perceived appropriateness of system responses we conduct a human study using crowd-sourcing on the FigureEight platform. We define appropriateness as \u201cacceptable behaviour in a work environment\u201d and the participants were made aware that the conversations took place between a human and a system. Ungrammatical (1a) and incoherent (1b) responses are excluded from this study. We collect appropriateness ratings given a stimulus (the prompt) and four randomly sampled responses from our corpus that the worker is to label following the methodology described in BIBREF21, where each utterance is rated relatively to a reference on a user-defined scale. Ratings are then normalised on a scale from [0-1]. This methodology was shown to produce more reliable user ratings than commonly used Likert Scales. In addition, we collect demographic information, including gender and age group. In total we collected 9960 HITs from 472 crowd workers. In order to identify spammers and unsuitable ratings, we use the responses from the adult-only bots as test questions: We remove users who give high ratings to sexual bot responses the majority (more than 55%) of the time.18,826 scores remain - resulting in an average of 7.7 ratings per individual system reply and 1568.8 ratings per response type as listed in Table TABREF14.Due to missing demographic data - and after removing malicious crowdworkers - we only consider a subset of 190 raters for our demographic study. The group is composed of 130 men and 60 women. Most raters (62.6%) are under the age of 44, with similar proportions across age groups for men and women. This is in-line with our target population: 57% of users of smart speakers are male and the majority are under 44 BIBREF22.\nThe ranks and mean scores of response categories can be seen in Table TABREF29. Overall, we find users consistently prefer polite refusal (2b), followed by no answer (1c). Chastising (2d) and \u201cdon't know\" (1e) rank together at position 3, while flirting (3c) and retaliation (2e) rank lowest. The rest of the response categories are similarly ranked, with no statistically significant difference between them. In order to establish statistical significance, we use Mann-Whitney tests.\nPrevious research has shown gender to be the most important factor in predicting a person's definition of sexual harassment BIBREF23. However, we find small and not statistically significant differences in the overall rank given by users of different gender (see tab:ageresults).\nRegarding the user's age, we find strong differences between GenZ (18-25) raters and other groups. Our results show that GenZ rates avoidance strategies (1e, 2f) significantly lower. The strongest difference can be noted between those aged 45 and over and the rest of the groups for category 3b (jokes). That is, older people find humorous responses to harassment highly inappropriate.\nHere, we explore the hypothesis, that users perceive different responses as appropriate, dependent on the type and gravity of harassment, see Section SECREF2. The results in Table TABREF33 indeed show that perceived appropriateness varies significantly between prompt contexts. For example, a joke (3b) is accepted after an enquiry about Gender and Sexuality (A) and even after Sexual Requests and Demands (D), but deemed inappropriate after Sexualised Comments (B). Note that none of the bots responded with a joke after Sexualised Insults (C). Avoidance (2f) is considered most appropriate in the context of Sexualised Demands. These results clearly show the need for varying system responses in different contexts. However, the corpus study from Amanda:EthicsNLP2018 shows that current state-of-the-art systems do not adapt their responses sufficiently.\nFinally, we consider appropriateness per system. Following related work by BIBREF21, BIBREF24, we use Trueskill BIBREF25 to cluster systems into equivalently rated groups according to their partial relative rankings. The results in Table TABREF36 show that the highest rated systen is Alley, a purpose build bot for online language learning. Alley produces \u201cpolite refusal\u201d (2b) - the top ranked strategy - 31% of the time. Comparatively, commercial systems politely refuse only between 17% (Cortana) and 2% (Alexa). Most of the time commercial systems tend to \u201cplay along\u201d (3a), joke (3b) or don't know how to answer (1e) which tend to receive lower ratings, see Figure FIGREF38. Rule-based systems most often politely refuse to answer (2b), but also use medium ranked strategies, such as deflect (2c) or chastise (2d). For example, most of Eliza's responses fall under the \u201cdeflection\u201d strategy, such as \u201cWhy do you ask?\u201d. Data-driven systems rank low in general. Neuralconvo and Cleverbot are the only ones that ever politely refuse and we attribute their improved ratings to this. In turn, the \u201cclean\u201d seq2seq often produces responses which can be interpreted as flirtatious (44%), and ranks similarly to Annabelle Lee and Laurel Sweet, the only adult bots that politely refuses ( 16% of the time). Ritter:2010:UMT:1857999.1858019's IR approach is rated similarly to Capt Howdy and both produce a majority of retaliatory (2e) responses - 38% and 58% respectively - followed by flirtatious responses. Finally, Dr Love and Sophia69 produce almost exclusively flirtatious responses which are consistently ranked low by users.\nCrowdsourced user studies are widely used for related tasks, such as evaluating dialogue strategies, e.g. BIBREF26, and for eliciting a moral stance from a population BIBREF27. Our crowdsourced setup is similar to an \u201coverhearer experiment\u201d as e.g. conducted by Ma:2019:handlingChall where study participants were asked to rate the system's emotional competence after watching videos of challenging user behaviour. However, we believe that the ultimate measure for abuse mitigation should come from users interacting with the system. chin2019should make a first step into this direction by investigating different response styles (Avoidance, Empathy, Counterattacking) to verbal abuse, and recording the user's emotional reaction \u2013 hoping that eliciting certain emotions, such as guilt, will eventually stop the abuse. While we agree that stopping the abuse should be the ultimate goal, BIBREF28's study is limited in that participants were not genuine (ab)users, but instructed to abuse the system in a certain way. BIBREF29 report that a pilot using a similar setup let to unnatural interactions, which limits the conclusions we can draw about the effectiveness of abuse mitigation strategies.

{"id": "1805.11937", "prompt": "Encoding of words is perhaps the most important step towards a successful end-to-end natural language processing application. Although word embeddings have been shown to provide benefit to such models, they commonly treat words as the smallest meaning bearing unit and assume that each word type has its own vector representation. This assumption has two major shortcomings especially for languages with rich morphology: (1) inability to handle unseen or out-of-vocabulary (OOV) word-forms (2) inability to exploit the regularities among word parts. The limitations of word embeddings are particularly pronounced in sentence-level semantic tasks, especially in languages where word parts play a crucial role. Consider the Turkish sentences \u201cK\u00f6y+l\u00fc-ler (villagers) \u015fehr+e (to town) geldi (came)\u201d and \u201cSendika+l\u0131-lar (union members) meclis+e (to council) geldi (came)\u201d. Here the stems k\u00f6y (village) and sendika (union) function similarly in semantic terms with respect to the verb come (as the origin of the agents of the verb), where \u015fehir (town) and meclis (council) both function as the end point. These semantic similarities are determined by the common word parts shown in bold. However ortographic similarity does not always correspond to semantic similarity. For instance the ortographically similar words knight and night have large semantic differences. Therefore, for a successful semantic application, the model should be able to capture both the regularities, i.e, morphological tags and the irregularities, i.e, lemmas of the word.\nMorphological analysis already provides the aforementioned information about the words. However access to useful morphological features may be problematic due to software licensing issues, lack of robust morphological analyzers and high ambiguity among analyses. Character-level models (CLM), being a cheaper and accessible alternative to morphology, have been reported as performing competitively on various NLP tasks BIBREF0 , BIBREF1 , BIBREF2 . However the extent to which these tasks depend on morphology is small; and their relation to semantics is weak. Hence, little is known on their true ability to reveal the underlying morphological structure of a word and their semantic capabilities. Furthermore, their behaviour across languages from different families; and their limitations and strengths such as handling of long-range dependencies, reaction to model complexity or performance on out-of-domain data are unknown. Analyzing such issues is a key to fully understanding the character-level models.\nTo achieve this, we perform a case study on semantic role labeling (SRL), a sentence-level semantic analysis task that aims to identify predicate-argument structures and assign meaningful labels to them as follows:\n $[$ Villagers $]$ comers came $[$ to town $]$ end point\nWe use a simple method based on bidirectional LSTMs to train three types of base semantic role labelers that employ (1) words (2) characters and character sequences and (3) gold morphological analysis. The gold morphology serves as the upper bound for us to compare and analyze the performances of character-level models on languages of varying morphological typologies. We carry out an exhaustive error analysis for each language type and analyze the strengths and limitations of character-level models compared to morphology. In regard to the diversity hypothesis which states that diversity of systems in ensembles lead to further improvement, we combine character and morphology-level models and measure the performance of the ensemble to better understand how similar they are.\nWe experiment with several languages with varying degrees of morphological richness and typology: Turkish, Finnish, Czech, German, Spanish, Catalan and English. Our experiments and analysis reveal insights such as:\nFormally, we generate a label sequence $\\vec{l}$ for each sentence and predicate pair: $(s,p)$ . Each $l_t\\in \\vec{l}$ is chosen from $\\mathcal {L}=\\lbrace  \\mathit {roles \\cup nonrole}\\rbrace $ , where $roles$ are language-specific semantic roles (mostly consistent with PropBank) and $nonrole$ is a symbol to present tokens that are not arguments. Given $\\theta $ as model parameters and $g_t$ as gold label for $t_{th}$ token, we find the parameters that minimize the negative log likelihood of the sequence: \n$$\\hat{\\theta }=\\underset{\\theta }{\\arg \\min } \\left( -\\sum _{t=1}^n log (p(g_t|\\theta ,s,p)) \\right)$$   (Eq. 7) \nLabel probabilities, $p(l_t|\\theta ,s,p)$ , are calculated with equations given below. First, the word encoding layer splits tokens into subwords via $\\rho $ function. \n$$\\rho (w) = {s_0,s_1,..,s_n}$$   (Eq. 8) \nAs proposed by BIBREF0 , we treat words as a sequence of subword units. Then, the sequence is fed to a simple bi-LSTM network BIBREF15 , BIBREF16 and hidden states from each direction are weighted with a set of parameters which are also learned during training. Finally, the weighted vector is used as the word embedding given in Eq. 9 . \n$$hs_f, hs_b = \\text{bi-LSTM}({s_0,s_1,..,s_n}) \\\\\n\\vec{w} = W_f \\cdot hs_f + W_b \\cdot hs_b + b$$   (Eq. 9) \nThere may be more than one predicate in the sentence so it is crucial to inform the network of which arguments we aim to label. In order to mark the predicate of interest, we concatenate a predicate flag $pf_t$ to the word embedding vector. \n$$\\vec{x_{t}} = [\\vec{w};pf_t]$$   (Eq. 10) \nFinal vector, $\\vec{x_t}$ serves as an input to another bi-LSTM unit. \n$$\\vec{h_{f}, h_{b}} = \\text{bi-LSTM}(x_{t})$$   (Eq. 11) \nFinally, the label distribution is calculated via softmax function over the concatenated hidden states from both directions. \n$$\\vec{p(l_t|s,p)} = softmax(W_{l}\\cdot [\\vec{h_{f}};\\vec{h_{b}}]+\\vec{b_{l}})$$   (Eq. 12) \nFor simplicity, we assign the label with the highest probability to the input token. .\nWe use three types of units: (1) words (2) characters and character sequences and (3) outputs of morphological analysis. Words serve as a lower bound; while morphology is used as an upper bound for comparison. Table 1 shows sample outputs of various $\\rho $ functions.\nHere, char function simply splits the token into its characters. Similar to n-gram language models, char3 slides a character window of width $n=3$ over the token. Finally, gold morphological features are used as outputs of morph-language. Throughout this paper, we use morph and oracle interchangably, i.e., morphology-level models (MLM) have access to gold tags unless otherwise is stated. For all languages, morph outputs the lemma of the token followed by language specific morphological tags. As an exception, it outputs additional information for some languages, such as parts-of-speech tags for Turkish. Word segmenters such as Morfessor and Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) are other commonly used subword units. Due to low scores obtained from our preliminary experiments and unsatisfactory results from previous studies BIBREF13 , we excluded these units.\nWe use the datasets distributed by LDC for Catalan (CAT), Spanish (SPA), German (DEU), Czech (CZE) and English (ENG) BIBREF17 , BIBREF18 ; and datasets made available by BIBREF19 , BIBREF20 for Finnish (FIN) and Turkish (TUR) respectively . Datasets are provided with syntactic dependency annotations and semantic roles of verbal predicates. In addition, English supplies nominal predicates annotated with semantic roles and does not provide any morphological feature.\nStatistics for the training split for all languages are given in Table 2 . Here, #pred is number of predicates, and #role refers to number distinct semantic roles that occur more than 10 times. More detailed statistics about the datasets can be found in BIBREF27 , BIBREF19 , BIBREF20 .\nTo fit the requirements of the SRL task and of our model, we performed the following:\nMultiword expressions (MWE) are represented as a single token, (e.g., Confederaci\u00f3n_Francesa_del_Trabajo), that causes notably long character sequences which are hard to handle by LSTMs. For the sake of memory efficiency and performance, we used an abbreviation (e.g., CFdT) for each MWE during training and testing.\nOriginal dataset defines its own format of semantic annotation, such as 17:PBArgM_mod $\\mid $ 19:PBArgM_mod meaning the node is an argument of $17_{th}$ and $19_{th}$ tokens with ArgM-mod (temporary modifier) semantic role. They have been converted into CoNLL-09 tabular format, where each predicate's arguments are given in a specific column.\nWords are splitted from derivational boundaries in the original dataset, where each inflectional group is represented as a separate token. We first merge boundaries of the same word, i.e, tokens of the word, then we use our own $\\rho $ function to split words into subwords.\nWe lowercase all tokens beforehand and place special start and end of the token characters. For all experiments, we initialized weight parameters orthogonally and used one layer bi-LSTMs both for subword composition and argument labeling with hidden size of 200. Subword embedding size is chosen as 200. We used gradient clipping and early stopping to prevent overfitting. Stochastic gradient descent is used as the optimizer. The initial learning rate is set to 1 and reduced by half if scores on development set do not improve after 3 epochs. We use the provided splits and evaluate the results with the official evaluation script provided by CoNLL-09 shared task. In this work (and in most of the recent SRL works), only the scores for argument labeling are reported, which may cause confusions for the readers while comparing with older SRL studies. Most of the early SRL work report combined scores (argument labeling with predicate sense disambiguation (PSD)). However, PSD is considered a simpler task with higher F1 scores . Therefore, we believe omitting PSD helps us gain more useful insights on character level models.\nOur main results on test and development sets for models that use words, characters (char), character trigrams (char3) and morphological analyses (morph) are given in Table 3 . We calculate improvement over word (IOW) for each subword model and improvement over the best character model (IOC) for the morph. IOW and IOC values are calculated on the test set.\nThe biggest improvement over the word baseline is achieved by the models that have access to morphology for all languages (except for English) as expected. Character trigrams consistently outperformed characters by a small margin. Same pattern is observed on the results of the development set. IOW has the values between 0% to 38% while IOC values range between 2%-10% dependending on the properties of the language and the dataset. We analyze the results separately for agglutinative and fusional languages and reveal the links between certain linguistic phenomena and the IOC, IOW values.\nOne way to infer similarity is to measure diversity. Consider a set of baseline models that are not diverse, i.e., making similar errors with similar inputs. In such a case, combination of these models would not be able to overcome the biases of the learners, hence the combination would not achieve a better result. In order to test if character and morphological models are similar, we combine them and measure the performance of the ensemble. Suppose that a prediction $p_{i}$ is generated for each token by a model $m_i$ , $i \\in n$ , then the final prediction is calculated from these predictions by: \n$$p_{final} = f(p_0, p_1,..,p_n|\\phi )$$   (Eq. 36) \nwhere $f$ is the combining function with parameter $\\phi $ . The simplest global approach is averaging (AVG), where $f$ is simply the mean function and $p_i$ s are the log probabilities. Mean function combines model outputs linearly, therefore ignores the nonlinear relation between base models/units. In order to exploit nonlinear connections, we learn the parameters $\\phi $ of $f$ via a simple linear layer followed by sigmoid activation. In other words, we train a new model that learns how to best combine the predictions from subword models. This ensemble technique is generally referred to as stacking or stacked generalization (SG). \nAlthough not guaranteed, diverse models can be achieved by altering the input representation, the learning algorithm, training data or the hyperparameters. To ensure that the only factor contributing to the diversity of the learners is the input representation, all parameters, training data and model settings are left unchanged.\nOur results are given in Table 4 . IOB shows the improvement over the best of the baseline models in the ensemble. Averaging and stacking methods gave similar results, meaning that there is no immediate nonlinear relations between units. We observe two language clusters: (1) Czech and agglutinative languages (2) Spanish, Catalan, German and English. The common property of that separate clusters are (1) high OOV% and (2) relatively low OOV%. Amongst the first set, we observe that the improvement gained by character-morphology ensembles is higher (shown with green) than ensembles between characters and character trigrams (shown with red), whereas the opposite is true for the second set of languages. It can be interpreted as character level models being more similar to the morphology level models for the first cluster, i.e., languages with high OOV%, and characters and morphology being more diverse for the second cluster.\nTo expand our understanding and reveal the limitations and strengths of the models, we analyze their ability to handle long range dependencies, their relation with training data and model size; and measure their performances on out of domain data.\nLong range dependency is considered as an important linguistic issue that is hard to solve. Therefore the ability to handle it is a strong performance indicator. To gain insights on this issue, we measure how models perform as the distance between the predicate and the argument increases. The unit of measure is number of tokens between the two; and argument is defined as the head of the argument phrase in accordance with dependency-based SRL task. For that purpose, we created bins of [0-4], [5-9], [10-14] and [15-19] distances. Then, we have calculate F1 scores for arguments in each bin. Due to low number of predicate-argument pairs in buckets, we could not analyze German and Turkish; and also the bin [15-19] is only used for Czech. Our results are shown in Fig. 3 . We observe that either char or char3 closely follows the oracle for all languages. The gap between the two does not increase with the distance, suggesting that the performance gap is not related to long range dependencies. In other words, both characters and the oracle handle long range dependencies equally well.\nWe analyzed how char3 and oracle models perform with respect to the training data size. For that purpose, we trained them on chunks of increasing size and evaluate on the provided test split. We used units of 2000 sentences for German and Czech; and 400 for Turkish. Results are shown in Fig. 4 . Apparently as the data size increases, the performances of both models logarithmically increase - with a varying speed. To speak in statistical terms, we fit a logarithmic curve to the observed F1 scores (shown with transparent lines) and check the x coefficients, where x refers to the number of sentences. This coefficient can be considered as an approximation to the speed of growth with data size. We observe that the coefficient is higher for char3 than oracle for all languages. It can be interpreted as: in the presence of more training data, char3 may surpass the oracle; i.e., char3 relies on data more than the oracle.\nAs part of the CoNLL09 shared task BIBREF27 , out of domain test sets are provided for three languages: Czech, German and English. We test our models trained on regular training dataset on these OOD data. The results are given in Table 5 . Here, we clearly see that the best model has shifted from oracle to character based models. The dramatic drop in German oracle model is due to the high lemma OOV rate which is a consequence of keeping compounds as a single lemma. Czech oracle model performs reasonably however is unable to beat the generalization power of the char3 model. Furthermore, the scores of the character models in Table 5 are higher than the best OOD scores reported in the shared task BIBREF27 ; even though our main results on evaluation set are not (except for Czech). This shows that character-level models have increased robustness to out-of-domain data due to their ability to learn regularities among data.\nThroughout this paper, our aim was to gain insights on how models perform on different languages rather than scoring the highest F1. For this reason, we used a model that can be considered small when compared to recent neural SRL models and avoided parameter search. However, we wonder how the models behave when given a larger network. To answer this question, we trained char3 and oracle models with more layers for two fusional languages (Spanish, Catalan), and two agglutinative languages (Finnish, Turkish). The results given in Table 6 clearly shows that model complexity provides relatively more benefit to morphological models. This indicates that morphological signals help to extract more complex linguistic features that have semantic clues.\nAlthough models with access to gold morphological tags achieve better F1 scores than character models, they can be less useful a in real-life scenario since they require gold tags at test time. To predict the performance of morphology-level models in such a scenario, we train the same models with the same parameters with predicted morphological features. Predicted tags were only available for German, Spanish, Catalan and Czech. Our results given in Fig. 5 , show that (except for Czech), predicted morphological tags are not as useful as characters alone.\nCharacter-level neural models are becoming the defacto standard for NLP problems due to their accessibility and ability to handle unseen data. In this work, we investigated how they compare to models with access to gold morphological analysis, on a sentence-level semantic task. We evaluated their quality on semantic role labeling in a number of agglutinative and fusional languages.

{"id": "1805.11937", "prompt": "Encoding of words is perhaps the most important step towards a successful end-to-end natural language processing application. Although word embeddings have been shown to provide benefit to such models, they commonly treat words as the smallest meaning bearing unit and assume that each word type has its own vector representation. This assumption has two major shortcomings especially for languages with rich morphology: (1) inability to handle unseen or out-of-vocabulary (OOV) word-forms (2) inability to exploit the regularities among word parts. The limitations of word embeddings are particularly pronounced in sentence-level semantic tasks, especially in languages where word parts play a crucial role. Consider the Turkish sentences \u201cK\u00f6y+l\u00fc-ler (villagers) \u015fehr+e (to town) geldi (came)\u201d and \u201cSendika+l\u0131-lar (union members) meclis+e (to council) geldi (came)\u201d. Here the stems k\u00f6y (village) and sendika (union) function similarly in semantic terms with respect to the verb come (as the origin of the agents of the verb), where \u015fehir (town) and meclis (council) both function as the end point. These semantic similarities are determined by the common word parts shown in bold. However ortographic similarity does not always correspond to semantic similarity. For instance the ortographically similar words knight and night have large semantic differences. Therefore, for a successful semantic application, the model should be able to capture both the regularities, i.e, morphological tags and the irregularities, i.e, lemmas of the word.\nMorphological analysis already provides the aforementioned information about the words. However access to useful morphological features may be problematic due to software licensing issues, lack of robust morphological analyzers and high ambiguity among analyses. Character-level models (CLM), being a cheaper and accessible alternative to morphology, have been reported as performing competitively on various NLP tasks BIBREF0 , BIBREF1 , BIBREF2 . However the extent to which these tasks depend on morphology is small; and their relation to semantics is weak. Hence, little is known on their true ability to reveal the underlying morphological structure of a word and their semantic capabilities. Furthermore, their behaviour across languages from different families; and their limitations and strengths such as handling of long-range dependencies, reaction to model complexity or performance on out-of-domain data are unknown. Analyzing such issues is a key to fully understanding the character-level models.\nTo achieve this, we perform a case study on semantic role labeling (SRL), a sentence-level semantic analysis task that aims to identify predicate-argument structures and assign meaningful labels to them as follows:\n $[$ Villagers $]$ comers came $[$ to town $]$ end point\nWe use a simple method based on bidirectional LSTMs to train three types of base semantic role labelers that employ (1) words (2) characters and character sequences and (3) gold morphological analysis. The gold morphology serves as the upper bound for us to compare and analyze the performances of character-level models on languages of varying morphological typologies. We carry out an exhaustive error analysis for each language type and analyze the strengths and limitations of character-level models compared to morphology. In regard to the diversity hypothesis which states that diversity of systems in ensembles lead to further improvement, we combine character and morphology-level models and measure the performance of the ensemble to better understand how similar they are.\nWe experiment with several languages with varying degrees of morphological richness and typology: Turkish, Finnish, Czech, German, Spanish, Catalan and English. Our experiments and analysis reveal insights such as:\nFormally, we generate a label sequence $\\vec{l}$ for each sentence and predicate pair: $(s,p)$ . Each $l_t\\in \\vec{l}$ is chosen from $\\mathcal {L}=\\lbrace  \\mathit {roles \\cup nonrole}\\rbrace $ , where $roles$ are language-specific semantic roles (mostly consistent with PropBank) and $nonrole$ is a symbol to present tokens that are not arguments. Given $\\theta $ as model parameters and $g_t$ as gold label for $t_{th}$ token, we find the parameters that minimize the negative log likelihood of the sequence: \n$$\\hat{\\theta }=\\underset{\\theta }{\\arg \\min } \\left( -\\sum _{t=1}^n log (p(g_t|\\theta ,s,p)) \\right)$$   (Eq. 7) \nLabel probabilities, $p(l_t|\\theta ,s,p)$ , are calculated with equations given below. First, the word encoding layer splits tokens into subwords via $\\rho $ function. \n$$\\rho (w) = {s_0,s_1,..,s_n}$$   (Eq. 8) \nAs proposed by BIBREF0 , we treat words as a sequence of subword units. Then, the sequence is fed to a simple bi-LSTM network BIBREF15 , BIBREF16 and hidden states from each direction are weighted with a set of parameters which are also learned during training. Finally, the weighted vector is used as the word embedding given in Eq. 9 . \n$$hs_f, hs_b = \\text{bi-LSTM}({s_0,s_1,..,s_n}) \\\\\n\\vec{w} = W_f \\cdot hs_f + W_b \\cdot hs_b + b$$   (Eq. 9) \nThere may be more than one predicate in the sentence so it is crucial to inform the network of which arguments we aim to label. In order to mark the predicate of interest, we concatenate a predicate flag $pf_t$ to the word embedding vector. \n$$\\vec{x_{t}} = [\\vec{w};pf_t]$$   (Eq. 10) \nFinal vector, $\\vec{x_t}$ serves as an input to another bi-LSTM unit. \n$$\\vec{h_{f}, h_{b}} = \\text{bi-LSTM}(x_{t})$$   (Eq. 11) \nFinally, the label distribution is calculated via softmax function over the concatenated hidden states from both directions. \n$$\\vec{p(l_t|s,p)} = softmax(W_{l}\\cdot [\\vec{h_{f}};\\vec{h_{b}}]+\\vec{b_{l}})$$   (Eq. 12) \nFor simplicity, we assign the label with the highest probability to the input token. .\nWe use three types of units: (1) words (2) characters and character sequences and (3) outputs of morphological analysis. Words serve as a lower bound; while morphology is used as an upper bound for comparison. Table 1 shows sample outputs of various $\\rho $ functions.\nHere, char function simply splits the token into its characters. Similar to n-gram language models, char3 slides a character window of width $n=3$ over the token. Finally, gold morphological features are used as outputs of morph-language. Throughout this paper, we use morph and oracle interchangably, i.e., morphology-level models (MLM) have access to gold tags unless otherwise is stated. For all languages, morph outputs the lemma of the token followed by language specific morphological tags. As an exception, it outputs additional information for some languages, such as parts-of-speech tags for Turkish. Word segmenters such as Morfessor and Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) are other commonly used subword units. Due to low scores obtained from our preliminary experiments and unsatisfactory results from previous studies BIBREF13 , we excluded these units.\nWe use the datasets distributed by LDC for Catalan (CAT), Spanish (SPA), German (DEU), Czech (CZE) and English (ENG) BIBREF17 , BIBREF18 ; and datasets made available by BIBREF19 , BIBREF20 for Finnish (FIN) and Turkish (TUR) respectively . Datasets are provided with syntactic dependency annotations and semantic roles of verbal predicates. In addition, English supplies nominal predicates annotated with semantic roles and does not provide any morphological feature.\nStatistics for the training split for all languages are given in Table 2 . Here, #pred is number of predicates, and #role refers to number distinct semantic roles that occur more than 10 times. More detailed statistics about the datasets can be found in BIBREF27 , BIBREF19 , BIBREF20 .\nTo fit the requirements of the SRL task and of our model, we performed the following:\nMultiword expressions (MWE) are represented as a single token, (e.g., Confederaci\u00f3n_Francesa_del_Trabajo), that causes notably long character sequences which are hard to handle by LSTMs. For the sake of memory efficiency and performance, we used an abbreviation (e.g., CFdT) for each MWE during training and testing.\nOriginal dataset defines its own format of semantic annotation, such as 17:PBArgM_mod $\\mid $ 19:PBArgM_mod meaning the node is an argument of $17_{th}$ and $19_{th}$ tokens with ArgM-mod (temporary modifier) semantic role. They have been converted into CoNLL-09 tabular format, where each predicate's arguments are given in a specific column.\nWords are splitted from derivational boundaries in the original dataset, where each inflectional group is represented as a separate token. We first merge boundaries of the same word, i.e, tokens of the word, then we use our own $\\rho $ function to split words into subwords.\nWe lowercase all tokens beforehand and place special start and end of the token characters. For all experiments, we initialized weight parameters orthogonally and used one layer bi-LSTMs both for subword composition and argument labeling with hidden size of 200. Subword embedding size is chosen as 200. We used gradient clipping and early stopping to prevent overfitting. Stochastic gradient descent is used as the optimizer. The initial learning rate is set to 1 and reduced by half if scores on development set do not improve after 3 epochs. We use the provided splits and evaluate the results with the official evaluation script provided by CoNLL-09 shared task. In this work (and in most of the recent SRL works), only the scores for argument labeling are reported, which may cause confusions for the readers while comparing with older SRL studies. Most of the early SRL work report combined scores (argument labeling with predicate sense disambiguation (PSD)). However, PSD is considered a simpler task with higher F1 scores . Therefore, we believe omitting PSD helps us gain more useful insights on character level models.\nOur main results on test and development sets for models that use words, characters (char), character trigrams (char3) and morphological analyses (morph) are given in Table 3 . We calculate improvement over word (IOW) for each subword model and improvement over the best character model (IOC) for the morph. IOW and IOC values are calculated on the test set.\nThe biggest improvement over the word baseline is achieved by the models that have access to morphology for all languages (except for English) as expected. Character trigrams consistently outperformed characters by a small margin. Same pattern is observed on the results of the development set. IOW has the values between 0% to 38% while IOC values range between 2%-10% dependending on the properties of the language and the dataset. We analyze the results separately for agglutinative and fusional languages and reveal the links between certain linguistic phenomena and the IOC, IOW values.\nOne way to infer similarity is to measure diversity. Consider a set of baseline models that are not diverse, i.e., making similar errors with similar inputs. In such a case, combination of these models would not be able to overcome the biases of the learners, hence the combination would not achieve a better result. In order to test if character and morphological models are similar, we combine them and measure the performance of the ensemble. Suppose that a prediction $p_{i}$ is generated for each token by a model $m_i$ , $i \\in n$ , then the final prediction is calculated from these predictions by: \n$$p_{final} = f(p_0, p_1,..,p_n|\\phi )$$   (Eq. 36) \nwhere $f$ is the combining function with parameter $\\phi $ . The simplest global approach is averaging (AVG), where $f$ is simply the mean function and $p_i$ s are the log probabilities. Mean function combines model outputs linearly, therefore ignores the nonlinear relation between base models/units. In order to exploit nonlinear connections, we learn the parameters $\\phi $ of $f$ via a simple linear layer followed by sigmoid activation. In other words, we train a new model that learns how to best combine the predictions from subword models. This ensemble technique is generally referred to as stacking or stacked generalization (SG). \nAlthough not guaranteed, diverse models can be achieved by altering the input representation, the learning algorithm, training data or the hyperparameters. To ensure that the only factor contributing to the diversity of the learners is the input representation, all parameters, training data and model settings are left unchanged.\nOur results are given in Table 4 . IOB shows the improvement over the best of the baseline models in the ensemble. Averaging and stacking methods gave similar results, meaning that there is no immediate nonlinear relations between units. We observe two language clusters: (1) Czech and agglutinative languages (2) Spanish, Catalan, German and English. The common property of that separate clusters are (1) high OOV% and (2) relatively low OOV%. Amongst the first set, we observe that the improvement gained by character-morphology ensembles is higher (shown with green) than ensembles between characters and character trigrams (shown with red), whereas the opposite is true for the second set of languages. It can be interpreted as character level models being more similar to the morphology level models for the first cluster, i.e., languages with high OOV%, and characters and morphology being more diverse for the second cluster.\nTo expand our understanding and reveal the limitations and strengths of the models, we analyze their ability to handle long range dependencies, their relation with training data and model size; and measure their performances on out of domain data.\nLong range dependency is considered as an important linguistic issue that is hard to solve. Therefore the ability to handle it is a strong performance indicator. To gain insights on this issue, we measure how models perform as the distance between the predicate and the argument increases. The unit of measure is number of tokens between the two; and argument is defined as the head of the argument phrase in accordance with dependency-based SRL task. For that purpose, we created bins of [0-4], [5-9], [10-14] and [15-19] distances. Then, we have calculate F1 scores for arguments in each bin. Due to low number of predicate-argument pairs in buckets, we could not analyze German and Turkish; and also the bin [15-19] is only used for Czech. Our results are shown in Fig. 3 . We observe that either char or char3 closely follows the oracle for all languages. The gap between the two does not increase with the distance, suggesting that the performance gap is not related to long range dependencies. In other words, both characters and the oracle handle long range dependencies equally well.\nWe analyzed how char3 and oracle models perform with respect to the training data size. For that purpose, we trained them on chunks of increasing size and evaluate on the provided test split. We used units of 2000 sentences for German and Czech; and 400 for Turkish. Results are shown in Fig. 4 . Apparently as the data size increases, the performances of both models logarithmically increase - with a varying speed. To speak in statistical terms, we fit a logarithmic curve to the observed F1 scores (shown with transparent lines) and check the x coefficients, where x refers to the number of sentences. This coefficient can be considered as an approximation to the speed of growth with data size. We observe that the coefficient is higher for char3 than oracle for all languages. It can be interpreted as: in the presence of more training data, char3 may surpass the oracle; i.e., char3 relies on data more than the oracle.\nAs part of the CoNLL09 shared task BIBREF27 , out of domain test sets are provided for three languages: Czech, German and English. We test our models trained on regular training dataset on these OOD data. The results are given in Table 5 . Here, we clearly see that the best model has shifted from oracle to character based models. The dramatic drop in German oracle model is due to the high lemma OOV rate which is a consequence of keeping compounds as a single lemma. Czech oracle model performs reasonably however is unable to beat the generalization power of the char3 model. Furthermore, the scores of the character models in Table 5 are higher than the best OOD scores reported in the shared task BIBREF27 ; even though our main results on evaluation set are not (except for Czech). This shows that character-level models have increased robustness to out-of-domain data due to their ability to learn regularities among data.\nThroughout this paper, our aim was to gain insights on how models perform on different languages rather than scoring the highest F1. For this reason, we used a model that can be considered small when compared to recent neural SRL models and avoided parameter search. However, we wonder how the models behave when given a larger network. To answer this question, we trained char3 and oracle models with more layers for two fusional languages (Spanish, Catalan), and two agglutinative languages (Finnish, Turkish). The results given in Table 6 clearly shows that model complexity provides relatively more benefit to morphological models. This indicates that morphological signals help to extract more complex linguistic features that have semantic clues.\nAlthough models with access to gold morphological tags achieve better F1 scores than character models, they can be less useful a in real-life scenario since they require gold tags at test time. To predict the performance of morphology-level models in such a scenario, we train the same models with the same parameters with predicted morphological features. Predicted tags were only available for German, Spanish, Catalan and Czech. Our results given in Fig. 5 , show that (except for Czech), predicted morphological tags are not as useful as characters alone.\nCharacter-level neural models are becoming the defacto standard for NLP problems due to their accessibility and ability to handle unseen data. In this work, we investigated how they compare to models with access to gold morphological analysis, on a sentence-level semantic task. We evaluated their quality on semantic role labeling in a number of agglutinative and fusional languages.

{"id": "1909.09070", "prompt": "Scientific knowledge is heterogeneous and can present itself in many forms, including text, mathematical equations, figures and tables. Like many other manifestations of human thought, the scientific discourse usually adopts the form of a narrative, a scientific publication where related knowledge is presented in mutually supportive ways over different modalities. In the case of scientific figures, like charts, images and diagrams, these are usually accompanied by a text paragraph, a caption, that elaborates on the analysis otherwise visually represented.\nIn this paper, we make use of this observation and tap on the potential of learning from the enormous source of free supervision available in the scientific literature, with millions of figures and their captions. We build models that learn from the scientific discourse both visually and textually by simply looking at the figures and reading their explanatory captions, inspired in how humans learn by reading a scientific publication. To this purpose, we explore how multi-modal scientific knowledge can be learnt from the correspondence between figures and captions.\nThe main contributions of this paper are the following:\nAn unsupervised Figure-Caption Correspondence task (FCC) that jointly learns text and visual features useful to address a range of tasks involving scientific text and figures.\nA method to enrich such features with semantic knowledge transferred from structured knowledge graphs (KG).\nA study of the complexity of figure-caption correspondence compared to classical image-sentence matching.\nA qualitative and quantitative analysis of the learnt text and visual features through transfer learning tasks.\nA corpus of scientific figures and captions extracted from SN SciGraph and AI2 Semantic Scholar.\nWe present the FCC task in section SECREF3, including the network architecture, training protocol, and how adding pre-trained word and semantic embeddings can enrich the resulting text and visual features. In section SECREF4, we first introduce our datasets and evaluate the performance of our method in the task it was trained to solve, the correspondence between scientific figures and captions. Then, we relate our work to the state of the art in image-sentence matching and evaluate our approach in two challenging transfer learning tasks: caption and figure classification and multi-modal machine comprehension. In section SECREF5 we perform a qualitative study that illustrates how the FCC task leads to detailed textual and visual discrimination. Finally, in section SECREF6 we conclude the paper and advance future work.\nUnderstanding natural images has been a major area of research in computer vision, with well established datasets like ImageNet BIBREF0, Flickr8K BIBREF1, Flickr30K BIBREF2 and COCO BIBREF3. However, reasoning with other visual representations like scientific figures and diagrams has not received the same attention yet and entails additional challenges: Scientific figures are more abstract and symbolic, their captions tend to be significantly longer and use specialized lexicon, and the relation between a scientific figure and its caption is unique, i.e. in a scientific publication there is only one caption that corresponds with one figure and vice versa.\nThe FCC task presented herein is a form of co-training BIBREF4 where there are two views of the data and each view provides complementary information. Similar two-branch neural architectures focus on image-sentence BIBREF5, BIBREF6 and audio-video BIBREF7 matching. Others like BIBREF8 learn common embeddings from images and text. However, in such cases one or both networks are typically pre-trained.\nFocused on geometry, BIBREF9 maximize the agreement between text and visual data. In BIBREF10, the authors apply machine vision and natural language processing to extract data from figures and their associated text in bio-curation tasks. In BIBREF11, they parse diagram components and connectors as a Diagram Parse Graph (DPG), semantically interpret the DPG and use the model to answer diagram questions. While we rely on the correspondence between figures and captions, they train a specific classifier for each component and connector type and yet another model to ground the semantics of the DPG in each domain, like food webs or water cycles.\nKnowledge fusion approaches like BIBREF12 investigate the potential of complementing KG embeddings with text and natural images by integrating information across the three modalities in a single latent representation. They assume pre-trained entity representations exist in each individual modality, e.g. the visual features encoding the image of a ball, the word embeddings associated to the token \"ball\", and the KG embeddings related to the ball entity, which are then stitched together. In contrast, FCC co-trains text and visual features from figures and their captions and supports the enrichment of such features with lexical and semantic knowledge transferred from a KG during the training of the FCC task.\nThe main idea of our approach is to learn a correspondence task between scientific figures and their captions as they appear in a scientific publication. The information captured in the caption explains the corresponding figure in natural language, providing guidance to identify the key features of the figure and vice versa. By seeing a figure and reading the textual description in its caption we ultimately aim to learn representations that capture e.g. what it means that two plots are similar or what gravity looks like.\nWe leverage this observation to learn a figure-caption correspondence task. In essence, FCC is a binary classification task that receives a figure and a caption and determines whether they correspond or not. For training, the positive pairs are actual figures and their captions from a collection of scientific publications. Negative pairs are extracted from combinations of figures and any other randomly selected captions. The network is then made to learn text and visual features from scratch, without additional labelled data.\nWe propose a 2-branch neural architecture (figure FIGREF7) that has three main parts: the vision and language subnetworks, respectively extracting visual and text features, and a fusion subnetwork that takes the resulting features from the visual and text blocks and uses them to evaluate figure-caption correspondence.\nThe vision subnetwork follows a VGG-style BIBREF13 design, with 3x3 convolutional filters, 2x2 max-pooling layers with stride 2 and no padding. It contains 4 blocks of conv+conv+pool layers, where inside each block the two convolutional layers have the same number of filters, while consecutive blocks have doubling number of filters (64, 128, 256, 512). The input layer receives 224x224x3 images. The final layer produces a 512-D vector after 28x28 max-pooling. Each convolutional layer is followed by batch normalization BIBREF14 and ReLU layers. Based on BIBREF15, the language subnetwork has 3 convolutional blocks, each with 512 filters and a 5-element window size with ReLU activation. Each convolutional layer is followed by a 5-max pooling layer, except for the final layer, which produces a 512-D vector after 35-max pooling. The language subnetwork has a 300-D embeddings layer at the input, with a maximum sequence length of 1,000 tokens. The fusion subnetwork calculates the element-wise product of the 512-D visual and text feature vectors into a single vector $r$ to produce a 2-way classification output (correspond or not). It has two fully connected layers, with ReLU and an intermediate feature size of 128-D. The probability of each choice is the softmax of $r$, i.e. $\\hat{y} = softmax(r) \\in \\mathbb {R}^{2}$. During training, we minimize the negative log probability of the correct choice.\nThis architecture enables the FCC task to learn visual and text features from scratch in a completely unsupervised manner, just by observing the correspondence of figures and captions. Next, we extend it to enable the transfer of additional pre-trained information. Here, we focus on adding pre-trained embeddings on the language branch, and then back-propagate to the visual features during FCC training. Adding pre-trained visual features is also possible and indeed we also evaluate its impact in the FCC task in section SECREF14.\nLet $V$ be a vocabulary of words from a collection of documents $D$. Also, let $L$ be their lemmas, i.e. base forms without morphological or conjugational variations, and $C$ the concepts (or senses) in a KG. Each word $w_k$ in $V$, e.g. made, has one lemma $l_k$ (make) and may be linked to one or more concepts $c_k$ in $C$ (create or produce something).\nFor each word $w_k$, the FCC task learns a d-D embedding $\\vec{w}_k$, which can be combined with pre-trained word ($\\vec{w^{\\prime }}_k$), lemma ($\\vec{l}_k$) and concept ($\\vec{c}_k$) embeddings to produce a single vector $\\vec{t}_k$. If no pre-trained knowledge is transferred from an external source, then $\\vec{t}_k=\\vec{w}_k$. Note that we previously lemmatize and disambiguate $D$ against the KG in order to select the right pre-trained lemma and concept embeddings for each particular occurrence of $w_k$. Equation DISPLAY_FORM8 shows the different combinations of learnt and pre-trained embeddings we consider: (a) learnt word embeddings only, (b) learnt and pre-trained word embeddings and (c) learnt word embeddings and pre-trained semantic embeddings, including both lemmas and concepts, in line with our recent findings presented in BIBREF16.\nIn our experiments, concatenation proved optimal to combine the embeddings learnt by the network and the pre-trained embeddings, compared to other methods like summation, multiplication, average or learning a task-specific weighting of the different representations as in BIBREF17. Since some words may not have associated pre-trained word, lemma or concept embeddings, we pad these sequences with $\\varnothing _W$, $\\varnothing _L$ and $\\varnothing _C$, which are never included in the vocabulary. The dimensionality of $\\vec{t}_k$ is fixed to 300, i.e. the size of each sub-vector in configurations $(a)$, $(b)$ and $(c)$ is 300, 150 and 100, respectively. In doing so, we aimed at limiting the number of trainable parameters and balance the contribution of each information source.\nIn its most basic form, i.e. configuration $(a)$, the FCC network has over 32M trainable parameters (28M in the language subnetwork, 4M in the vision subnetwork and 135K in the fusion subnetwork) and takes 12 hours to train on a single GPU Nvidia GeForce RTX 2080 Ti for a relatively small corpus (SN SciGraph, see section SECREF12). We used 10-fold cross validation, Adam optimization BIBREF18 with learning rate $10^{-4}$ and weight decay $10^{-5}$. The network was implemented in Keras and TensorFlow, with batch size 32. The number of positive and negative cases is balanced within the batches.\nWe use HolE BIBREF19 and Vecsigrafo BIBREF16 to learn semantic embeddings. The latter extends the Swivel algorithm BIBREF20 to jointly learn word, lemma and concept embeddings on a corpus disambiguated against the KG, outperforming the previous state of the art in word and word-sense embeddings by co-training word, lemma and concept embeddings as opposed to training each individually. In contrast to Vecsigrafo, which requires both a text corpus and a KG, HolE follows a graph-based approach where embeddings are learnt exclusively from the KG. As section SECREF14 will show, this gives Vecsigrafo a certain advantage in the FCC task. Following up with the work presented in BIBREF16, our experiments focus on Sensigrafo, the KG underlying Expert System's Cogito NLP proprietary platform. Similar to WordNet, on which Vecsigrafo has also been successfully trained, Sensigrafo is a general-purpose KG with lexical and semantic information that contains over 300K concepts, 400K lemmas and 80 types of relations rendering 3M links. We use Cogito to disambiguate the text corpora prior to training Vecsigrafo. All the semantic (lemma and concept) embeddings produced with HolE or Vecsigrafo are 100-D.\nIn this section, first we evaluate the actual FCC task against two supervised baselines. Then, we situate our work in the more general image-sentence matching problem, showing empirical evidence of the additional complexity associated to the scientific domain and the figure-caption case compared to natural images. Next, we test the visual and text features learnt in the FCC task in two different transfer learning settings: classification of scientific figures and captions and multi-modal machine comprehension for question answering given a context of text, figures and images.\nWe have used the following datasets for training and evaluation:\nThe Semantic Scholar corpus BIBREF21 (SemScholar) is a large dataset of scientific publications made available by AI2. From its 39M articles, we downloaded 3,3M PDFs (the rest were behind paywalls, did not have a link or it was broken) and extracted 12.5M figures and captions through PDFFigures2 BIBREF22. We randomly selected 500K papers to train the FCC task on their figures and captions and another 500K to train Vecsigrafo on the text of their titles and abstracts.\nSpringer Nature's SciGraph contains 7M scientific publications organized in 22 scientific fields or categories. Since SciGraph does not provide a link to the PDF of the publication, we selected the intersection with SemScholar, producing a smaller corpus of 80K papers (in addition to the 1M papers from SemScholar mentioned above) and 82K figures that we used for training certain FCC configurations and supervised baselines (section SECREF14).\nThe Textbook Question Answering corpus BIBREF23 includes 1,076 lessons and 26,260 multi-modal test questions from middle school science curricula. Its complexity and scope make it a challenging textual and visual question answering dataset.\nWikipedia. We used the January 2018 English Wikipedia dataset as one of the corpora on which to train Vecsigrafo. As opposed to SciGraph or SemScholar, specific of the scientific domain, Wikipedia is a source of general-purpose information.\nFlickr30K and COCO, as image-sentence matching benchmarks.\nWe evaluate our method in the task it was trained to solve: determining whether a figure and a caption correspond. We also compare the performance of the FCC task against two supervised baselines, training them on a classification task against the SciGraph taxonomy. For such baselines we first train the vision and language networks independently and then combine them. The feature extraction parts of both networks are the same as described in section SECREF6. On top of them, we attach a fully connected layer with 128 neurons and ReLU activation and a softmax layer, with as many neurons as target classes.\nThe direct combination baseline computes the figure-caption correspondence through the scalar product between the softmax outputs of both networks. If it exceeds a threshold, which we heuristically fixed on 0.325, the result is positive. The supervised pre-training baseline freezes the weights of the feature extraction trunks from the two trained networks, assembles them in the FCC architecture as shown in section SECREF6, and trains the FCC task on the fully connected layers. While direct combination provides a notion of the agreement between the two branches, supervised pre-training is the most similar supervised approach to our method.\nTable TABREF15 shows the results of the FCC task and the supervised baselines. $FCC_k$ denotes the corpus and word representation used to train the FCC task. Acc$_{vgg}$ shows the accuracy after replacing our visual branch with pre-trained VGG16 features learnt on ImageNet. This provides an estimate of how specific of the scientific domain scientific figures and therefore the resulting visual features can be, compared to natural images. As the table shows, the results obtained using pre-trained visual features are clearly worse in general (only slightly better in $FCC_3$), suggesting that the visual information contained in scientific figures indeed differs from natural images.\nWe trained the FCC network on two different scientific corpora: SciGraph ($FCC_{1-5}$) and SemScholar ($FCC_{6-7}$). Both $FCC_1$ and $FCC_6$ learnt their own word representations without transfer of any pre-trained knowledge. Even in its most basic form our approach substantially improves over the supervised baselines, confirming that the visual and language branches learn from each other and also that figure-caption correspondence is an effective source of free supervision.\nAdding pre-trained knowledge at the input layer of the language subnetwork provides an additional boost, particularly with lemma and concept embeddings from Vecsigrafo ($FCC_5$). Vecsigrafo clearly outperformed HolE ($FCC_3$), which was also beaten by pre-trained fastText BIBREF24 word embeddings ($FCC_2$) trained on SemScholar.\nSince graph-based KG embedding approaches like HolE only generate embeddings of the artifacts explicitly contained in the KG, this may indicate that Sensigrafo, the KG used in this task, provides a partial coverage of the scientific domain, as could be expected since we are using an off-the-shelf version. Deeper inspection shows that HolE only covers 20% of the lemmas in the SciGraph vocabulary. On the other hand, Vecsigrafo, trained on the same KG, also captures lexical information from the text corpora it is trained on, Wikipedia or SemScholar, raising lemma coverage to 42% and 47%, respectively.\nAlthough the size of Wikipedia is almost triple of our SemScholar corpus, training Vecsigrafo on the latter resulted in better FCC accuracy ($FCC_4$ vs. $FCC_5$), suggesting that domain relevance is more significant than sheer volume, in line with our previous findings in BIBREF25. Training FCC on SemScholar, much larger than SciGraph, further improves accuracy, as shown in $FCC_6$ and $FCC_7$.\nWe put our FCC task in the context of the more general problem of image-sentence matching through a bidirectional retrieval task where images are sought given a text query and vice versa. While table TABREF20 focuses on natural images datasets (Flickr30K and COCO), table TABREF21 shows results on scientific datasets (SciGraph and SemScholar) rich in scientific figures and diagrams. The selected baselines (Embedding network, 2WayNet, VSE++ and DSVE-loc) report results obtained on the Flickr30K and COCO datasets, which we also include in table TABREF20. Performance is measured in recall at k ($Rk$), with k={1,5,10}. From the baselines, we successfully reproduced DSVE-loc, using the code made available by the authors, and trained it on SciGraph and SemScholar.\nWe trained the FCC task on all the datasets, both in a totally unsupervised way and with pre-trained semantic embeddings (indicated with subscript $vec$), and executed the bidirectional retrieval task using the resulting text and visual features. We also experimented with pre-trained VGG16 visual features extracted from ImageNet (subscript $vgg$), with more than 14 million hand-annotated images. Following common practice in image-sentence matching, our splits are 1,000 samples for test and the rest for training.\nWe can see a marked division between the results obtained on natural images datasets (table TABREF20) and those focused on scientific figures (table TABREF21). In the former case, VSE++ and DSVE-loc clearly beat all the other approaches. In contrast, our model performs poorly on such datasets although results are ameliorated when we use pre-trained visual features from ImageNet (\"Oursvgg\" and \"Oursvgg-vec\"). Interestingly, the situation reverts with the scientific datasets. While the recall of DSVE-loc drops dramatically in SciGraph, and even more in SemScholar, our approach shows the opposite behavior in both figure and caption retrieval. Using visual features enriched with pre-trained semantic embeddings from Vecsigrafo during training of the FCC task further improves recall in the bidirectional retrieval task. Compared to natural images, the additional complexity of scientific figures and their caption texts, which in addition are considerably longer (see table TABREF19), seems to have a clear impact in this regard.\nUnlike in Flickr30K and COCO, replacing the FCC visual features with pre-trained ones from ImageNet brings us little benefit in SciGraph and even less in SemScholar, where the combination of FCC and Vecsigrafo (\"Oursvec\") obtains the best results across the board. This and the extremely poor performance of the best image-sentence matching baseline (DSVE-loc) in the scientific datasets shows evidence that dealing with scientific figures is considerably more complex than natural images. Indeed, the best results in figure-caption correspondence (\"Oursvec\" in SemScholar) are still far from the SoA in image-sentence matching (DSVE-loc in COCO).\nWe evaluate the language and visual representations emerging from FCC in the context of two classification tasks that aim to identify the scientific field an arbitrary text fragment (a caption) or a figure belong to, according to the SciGraph taxonomy. The latter is a particularly hard task due to the whimsical nature of the figures that appear in our corpus: figure and diagram layout is arbitrary; charts, e.g. bar and pie charts, are used to showcase data in any field from health to engineering; figures and natural images appear indistinctly, etc. Also, note that we only rely on the actual figure, not the text fragment where it is mentioned in the paper.\nWe pick the text and visual features that produced the best FCC results with and without pre-trained semantic embeddings (table TABREF15, $FCC_7$ and $FCC_6$, respectively) and use the language and vision subnetworks presented in section SECREF6 to train our classifiers on SciGraph in two different scenarios. First, we only fine tune the fully connected and softmax layers, freezing the text and visual weights (non-trainable in the table). Second, we fine tune all the parameters in both networks (trainable). In both cases, we compare against a baseline using the same networks initialized with random weights, without FCC training. In doing so, through the first, non-trainable scenario, we seek to quantify the information contributed by the FCC features, while training from scratch on the target corpus should provide an upper bound for figure and caption classification. Additionally, for figure classification, we select a baseline of frozen VGG16 weights trained on ImageNet. We train using 10-fold cross validation and Adam. For the caption classification task, we select learning rate $10^{-3}$ and batch size 128. In figure classification, we use learning rate $10^{-4}$, weight decay $10^{-5}$ and batch size 32.\nThe results in table TABREF23 show that our approach amply beats the baselines, including the upper bound (training from scratch on SciGraph). The delta is particularly noticeable in the non trainable case for both caption and figure classification and is considerably increased in \"Ours $FCC_7$\", which uses pre-trained semantic embeddings. This includes both the random and VGG baselines and illustrates again the additional complexity of analyzing scientific figures compared to natural images, even if the latter is trained on a considerably larger corpus like ImageNet. Fine tuning the whole networks on SciGraph further improves accuracies. In this case, \"Ours $FCC_6$\", which uses FCC features without additional pre-trained embeddings, slightly outperforms \"Ours $FCC_7$\", suggesting a larger margin to learn from the task-specific corpus. Note that both $FCC_6$ and $FCC_7$ were trained on SemScholar.\nWe leverage the TQA dataset and the baselines in BIBREF23 to evaluate the features learnt by the FCC task in a multi-modal machine comprehension scenario. We study how our model, which was not originally trained for this task, performs against state of the art models specifically trained for diagram question answering and textual reading comprehension in a very challenging dataset. We also study how pre-trained semantic embeddings impact in the TQA task: first, by enriching the visual features learnt in the FCC task as shown in section SECREF6 and then by using pre-trained semantic embeddings to enrich word representations in the TQA corpus.\nWe focus on multiple-choice questions, 73% of the dataset. Table TABREF24 shows the performance of our model against the results reported in BIBREF23 for five TQA baselines: random, BiDAF (focused on text machine comprehension), text only ($TQA_1$, based on MemoryNet), text+image ($TQA_2$, VQA), and text+diagrams ($TQA_3$, DSDP-NET). We successfully reproduced the $TQA_1$ and $TQA_2$ architectures and adapted the latter. Then, we replaced the visual features in $TQA_2$ with those learnt by the FCC visual subnetwork both in a completely unsupervised way ($FCC_6$ in table TABREF15) and with pre-trained semantic embeddings ($FCC_7$), resulting in $TQA_4$ and $TQA_5$, respectively.\nWhile $TQA_{1-5}$ used no pre-trained embeddings at all, $TQA_{6-10}$ were trained including pre-trained Vecsigrafo semantic embeddings. Unlike FCC, where we used concatenation to combine pre-trained lemma and concept embeddings with the word embeddings learnt by the task, element-wise addition worked best in the case of TQA.\nFollowing the recommendations in BIBREF23, we pre-processed the TQA corpus to i) consider knowledge from previous lessons in the textbook in addition to the lesson of the question at hand and ii) address challenges like long question contexts with a large lexicon. In both text and diagram MC, applying the Pareto principle to reduce the maximum token sequence length in the text of each question, their answers and context improved accuracy considerably. This optimization allowed reducing the amount of text to consider for each question, improving the signal to noise ratio. Finally, we obtained the most relevant paragraphs for each question through tf-idf and trained the models using 10-fold cross validation, Adam, learning rate $10^{-2}$ and batch size 128. In text MC we also used 0.5 dropout and recurrent dropout in the LSTM layers.\nFitting multi-modal sources into a single memory, the use of visual FCC features clearly outperforms all the TQA baselines in diagram MC. Enhancing word representation with pre-trained semantic embeddings during training of the TQA task provides an additional boost that results in the highest accuracies for both text MC and diagram MC. These are significantly good results since, according to the TQA authors BIBREF23, most diagram questions in the TQA corpus would normally require a specific rich diagram parse, which we did not aim to provide.\nWe inspect the features learnt by our FCC task to gain a deeper understanding of the syntactic and semantic patterns captured for figure and caption representation. The findings reported herein are qualitatively consistent for all the FCC variations in table TABREF15.\nVision features. The analysis was carried out on an unconstrained variety of charts, diagrams and natural images from SciGraph, without filtering by figure type or scientific field. To obtain a representative sample of what the FCC network learns, we focus on the 512-D vector resulting from the last convolutional block before the fusion subnetwork. We pick the features with the most significant activation over the whole dataset and select the figures that activate them most. To this purpose, we prioritize those with higher maximum activation against the average activation.\nFigure FIGREF27 shows a selection of 6 visual features with the 4 figures that activate each feature more significantly and their activation heatmaps. Only figures are used as input, no text. As can be seen, the vision subnetwork has automatically learnt, without explicit supervision, to recognize different types of diagrams, charts and content, such as (from left to right) whisker plots, western blots (a technique used to identify proteins in a tissue sample), multi-image comparison diagrams, multi-modal data visualization charts (e.g. western plots vs. bar charts), line plots, and text within the figures. Furthermore, as shown by the heatmaps, our model discriminates the key elements associated to the figures that most activate each feature: the actual whiskers, the blots, the borders of each image under comparison, the blots and their complementary bar charts, as well as the line plots and the correspondence between them and the values in the x and y axes. Also, see (right-most column) how a feature discriminates text inserted in the figure, regardless of the remaining elements that may appear and the connections between them. This shows evidence of how the visual features learnt by the FCC task support the parsing of complex scientific diagrams.\nWe also estimated a notion of semantic specificity based on the concepts of a KG. For each visual feature, we aggregated the captions of the figures that most activate it and used Cogito to disambiguate the Sensigrafo concepts that appear in them. Then, we estimated how important each concept is to each feature by calculating its tf-idf. Finally, we averaged the resulting values to obtain a consolidated semantic specificity score per feature.\nThe scores of the features in figure FIGREF27 range between 0.42 and 0.65, which is consistently higher than average (0.4). This seems to indicate a correlation between activation and the semantic specificity of each visual feature. For example, the heatmaps of the figures related to the feature with the lowest tf-idf (left-most column) highlights a particular visual pattern, i.e. the whiskers, that may spread over many, possibly unrelated domains. On the other hand, the feature with the highest score (second column) focuses on a type of diagrams, western blots, almost exclusive of protein and genetic studies. Others, like the feature illustrated by the figures in the fifth column, capture the semantics of a specific type of 2D charts relating two magnitudes x and y. Analyzing their captions with Cogito, we see that concepts like e.g. isochronal and exponential functions are mentioned. If we look at the second and four top-most figures in the column, we can see that such concepts are also visually depicted in the figures, suggesting that the FCC task has learnt to recognize them both from the text and visually.\nText features. Similar to the visual case, we selected the features from the last block of the language subnetwork with the highest activation. For visualization purposes, we picked the figures corresponding to the captions in SciGraph that most activate such features (figure FIGREF28). No visual information is used.\nSeveral distinct patterns emerge from the text. The text feature in the first column seems to focus on genetics and histochemistry, including terms like western blots or immunostaining and variations like immunoblot-s/ted/ting. Interestingly, it also seems to have learnt some type of is-a relations (western blot is a type of immunoblot). The second feature focuses on variations of the term radiograph, e.g. radiograph-y/s. The third feature specializes in text related to curve plots involving several statistic analysis, e.g. Real-time PCR, one-way ANOVA or Gaussian distribution. Sometimes (fourth figure from top) the caption does not mention the plot directly, but focuses on the analysis instead, e.g. \"the data presented here are mean values of duplicate experiments\", indicating transfer of knowledge from the visual part during training. The fourth feature extracts citations and models named after prominent scientists, e.g. Evans function (first and fourth figure), Manley (1992) (second), and Aliev-Panfilov model (third). The fifth feature extracts chromatography terminology, e.g. 3D surface plot, photomicrograph or color map and, finally, the right-most feature focuses on different types of named diagrams, like flow charts and state diagrams, e.g. phylogenetic trees.\nAll the captions show a strong semantic correspondence with their associated figures. Figure FIGREF29 shows the activation heatmaps for two sample captions, calculated on the embeddings layer of the language subnetwork. The upper one corresponds to the fourth column left-right and third figure top-down in figure FIGREF28. Its caption reads: \"The Aliev-Panfilov model with $\\alpha =0.01$...The phase portrait depicts trajectories for distinct initial values $\\varphi _0$ and $r_0$...\". Below, (first column, fourth figure in figure FIGREF28): \"Relative protein levels of ubiquitin-protein conjugates in M. quadriceps...A representative immunoblot specific to ubiquitin...\". Consistently with our analysis, activation focuses on the most relevant tokens for each text feature: \"Aliev-Panfilov model\" and \"immunoblot\", respectively.\nThere is a wealth of knowledge in scientific literature and only a fraction of it is text. However, understanding scientific figures is a challenging task for machines, which is beyond their ability to process natural images. In this paper, we provide empirical evidence of this and show that co-training text and visual features from a large corpus of scientific figures and their captions in a correspondence task (FCC) is an effective, flexible and elegant unsupervised means towards overcoming such complexity. We show how such features can be significantly improved by enriching them with additional knowledge sources and, particularly, structured KGs. We prove the benefits of our approach against supervised baselines and in different transfer learning tasks, including text and visual classification and multi-modal machine comprehension applied to question answering, with results generally beyond the state of the art. In the future, it will be interesting to further the study of the interplay between the semantic concepts explicitly represented in different KGs, contextualized embeddings e.g. from SciBERT BIBREF31, and the text and visual features learnt in the FCC task. We also plan to continue to charter the knowledge captured in such features and to pursue the optimization and practical application of our approach.\nThe research reported in this paper is supported by the EU Horizon 2020 programme, under grants European Language Grid-825627 and Co-inform-770302.", "question": "What datasets are used in this paper?", "expected_output": "The Semantic Scholar corpus.

{"id": "1909.09070", "prompt": "Scientific knowledge is heterogeneous and can present itself in many forms, including text, mathematical equations, figures and tables. Like many other manifestations of human thought, the scientific discourse usually adopts the form of a narrative, a scientific publication where related knowledge is presented in mutually supportive ways over different modalities. In the case of scientific figures, like charts, images and diagrams, these are usually accompanied by a text paragraph, a caption, that elaborates on the analysis otherwise visually represented.\nIn this paper, we make use of this observation and tap on the potential of learning from the enormous source of free supervision available in the scientific literature, with millions of figures and their captions. We build models that learn from the scientific discourse both visually and textually by simply looking at the figures and reading their explanatory captions, inspired in how humans learn by reading a scientific publication. To this purpose, we explore how multi-modal scientific knowledge can be learnt from the correspondence between figures and captions.\nThe main contributions of this paper are the following:\nAn unsupervised Figure-Caption Correspondence task (FCC) that jointly learns text and visual features useful to address a range of tasks involving scientific text and figures.\nA method to enrich such features with semantic knowledge transferred from structured knowledge graphs (KG).\nA study of the complexity of figure-caption correspondence compared to classical image-sentence matching.\nA qualitative and quantitative analysis of the learnt text and visual features through transfer learning tasks.\nA corpus of scientific figures and captions extracted from SN SciGraph and AI2 Semantic Scholar.\nWe present the FCC task in section SECREF3, including the network architecture, training protocol, and how adding pre-trained word and semantic embeddings can enrich the resulting text and visual features. In section SECREF4, we first introduce our datasets and evaluate the performance of our method in the task it was trained to solve, the correspondence between scientific figures and captions. Then, we relate our work to the state of the art in image-sentence matching and evaluate our approach in two challenging transfer learning tasks: caption and figure classification and multi-modal machine comprehension. In section SECREF5 we perform a qualitative study that illustrates how the FCC task leads to detailed textual and visual discrimination. Finally, in section SECREF6 we conclude the paper and advance future work.\nUnderstanding natural images has been a major area of research in computer vision, with well established datasets like ImageNet BIBREF0, Flickr8K BIBREF1, Flickr30K BIBREF2 and COCO BIBREF3. However, reasoning with other visual representations like scientific figures and diagrams has not received the same attention yet and entails additional challenges: Scientific figures are more abstract and symbolic, their captions tend to be significantly longer and use specialized lexicon, and the relation between a scientific figure and its caption is unique, i.e. in a scientific publication there is only one caption that corresponds with one figure and vice versa.\nThe FCC task presented herein is a form of co-training BIBREF4 where there are two views of the data and each view provides complementary information. Similar two-branch neural architectures focus on image-sentence BIBREF5, BIBREF6 and audio-video BIBREF7 matching. Others like BIBREF8 learn common embeddings from images and text. However, in such cases one or both networks are typically pre-trained.\nFocused on geometry, BIBREF9 maximize the agreement between text and visual data. In BIBREF10, the authors apply machine vision and natural language processing to extract data from figures and their associated text in bio-curation tasks. In BIBREF11, they parse diagram components and connectors as a Diagram Parse Graph (DPG), semantically interpret the DPG and use the model to answer diagram questions. While we rely on the correspondence between figures and captions, they train a specific classifier for each component and connector type and yet another model to ground the semantics of the DPG in each domain, like food webs or water cycles.\nKnowledge fusion approaches like BIBREF12 investigate the potential of complementing KG embeddings with text and natural images by integrating information across the three modalities in a single latent representation. They assume pre-trained entity representations exist in each individual modality, e.g. the visual features encoding the image of a ball, the word embeddings associated to the token \"ball\", and the KG embeddings related to the ball entity, which are then stitched together. In contrast, FCC co-trains text and visual features from figures and their captions and supports the enrichment of such features with lexical and semantic knowledge transferred from a KG during the training of the FCC task.\nThe main idea of our approach is to learn a correspondence task between scientific figures and their captions as they appear in a scientific publication. The information captured in the caption explains the corresponding figure in natural language, providing guidance to identify the key features of the figure and vice versa. By seeing a figure and reading the textual description in its caption we ultimately aim to learn representations that capture e.g. what it means that two plots are similar or what gravity looks like.\nWe leverage this observation to learn a figure-caption correspondence task. In essence, FCC is a binary classification task that receives a figure and a caption and determines whether they correspond or not. For training, the positive pairs are actual figures and their captions from a collection of scientific publications. Negative pairs are extracted from combinations of figures and any other randomly selected captions. The network is then made to learn text and visual features from scratch, without additional labelled data.\nWe propose a 2-branch neural architecture (figure FIGREF7) that has three main parts: the vision and language subnetworks, respectively extracting visual and text features, and a fusion subnetwork that takes the resulting features from the visual and text blocks and uses them to evaluate figure-caption correspondence.\nThe vision subnetwork follows a VGG-style BIBREF13 design, with 3x3 convolutional filters, 2x2 max-pooling layers with stride 2 and no padding. It contains 4 blocks of conv+conv+pool layers, where inside each block the two convolutional layers have the same number of filters, while consecutive blocks have doubling number of filters (64, 128, 256, 512). The input layer receives 224x224x3 images. The final layer produces a 512-D vector after 28x28 max-pooling. Each convolutional layer is followed by batch normalization BIBREF14 and ReLU layers. Based on BIBREF15, the language subnetwork has 3 convolutional blocks, each with 512 filters and a 5-element window size with ReLU activation. Each convolutional layer is followed by a 5-max pooling layer, except for the final layer, which produces a 512-D vector after 35-max pooling. The language subnetwork has a 300-D embeddings layer at the input, with a maximum sequence length of 1,000 tokens. The fusion subnetwork calculates the element-wise product of the 512-D visual and text feature vectors into a single vector $r$ to produce a 2-way classification output (correspond or not). It has two fully connected layers, with ReLU and an intermediate feature size of 128-D. The probability of each choice is the softmax of $r$, i.e. $\\hat{y} = softmax(r) \\in \\mathbb {R}^{2}$. During training, we minimize the negative log probability of the correct choice.\nThis architecture enables the FCC task to learn visual and text features from scratch in a completely unsupervised manner, just by observing the correspondence of figures and captions. Next, we extend it to enable the transfer of additional pre-trained information. Here, we focus on adding pre-trained embeddings on the language branch, and then back-propagate to the visual features during FCC training. Adding pre-trained visual features is also possible and indeed we also evaluate its impact in the FCC task in section SECREF14.\nLet $V$ be a vocabulary of words from a collection of documents $D$. Also, let $L$ be their lemmas, i.e. base forms without morphological or conjugational variations, and $C$ the concepts (or senses) in a KG. Each word $w_k$ in $V$, e.g. made, has one lemma $l_k$ (make) and may be linked to one or more concepts $c_k$ in $C$ (create or produce something).\nFor each word $w_k$, the FCC task learns a d-D embedding $\\vec{w}_k$, which can be combined with pre-trained word ($\\vec{w^{\\prime }}_k$), lemma ($\\vec{l}_k$) and concept ($\\vec{c}_k$) embeddings to produce a single vector $\\vec{t}_k$. If no pre-trained knowledge is transferred from an external source, then $\\vec{t}_k=\\vec{w}_k$. Note that we previously lemmatize and disambiguate $D$ against the KG in order to select the right pre-trained lemma and concept embeddings for each particular occurrence of $w_k$. Equation DISPLAY_FORM8 shows the different combinations of learnt and pre-trained embeddings we consider: (a) learnt word embeddings only, (b) learnt and pre-trained word embeddings and (c) learnt word embeddings and pre-trained semantic embeddings, including both lemmas and concepts, in line with our recent findings presented in BIBREF16.\nIn our experiments, concatenation proved optimal to combine the embeddings learnt by the network and the pre-trained embeddings, compared to other methods like summation, multiplication, average or learning a task-specific weighting of the different representations as in BIBREF17. Since some words may not have associated pre-trained word, lemma or concept embeddings, we pad these sequences with $\\varnothing _W$, $\\varnothing _L$ and $\\varnothing _C$, which are never included in the vocabulary. The dimensionality of $\\vec{t}_k$ is fixed to 300, i.e. the size of each sub-vector in configurations $(a)$, $(b)$ and $(c)$ is 300, 150 and 100, respectively. In doing so, we aimed at limiting the number of trainable parameters and balance the contribution of each information source.\nIn its most basic form, i.e. configuration $(a)$, the FCC network has over 32M trainable parameters (28M in the language subnetwork, 4M in the vision subnetwork and 135K in the fusion subnetwork) and takes 12 hours to train on a single GPU Nvidia GeForce RTX 2080 Ti for a relatively small corpus (SN SciGraph, see section SECREF12). We used 10-fold cross validation, Adam optimization BIBREF18 with learning rate $10^{-4}$ and weight decay $10^{-5}$. The network was implemented in Keras and TensorFlow, with batch size 32. The number of positive and negative cases is balanced within the batches.\nWe use HolE BIBREF19 and Vecsigrafo BIBREF16 to learn semantic embeddings. The latter extends the Swivel algorithm BIBREF20 to jointly learn word, lemma and concept embeddings on a corpus disambiguated against the KG, outperforming the previous state of the art in word and word-sense embeddings by co-training word, lemma and concept embeddings as opposed to training each individually. In contrast to Vecsigrafo, which requires both a text corpus and a KG, HolE follows a graph-based approach where embeddings are learnt exclusively from the KG. As section SECREF14 will show, this gives Vecsigrafo a certain advantage in the FCC task. Following up with the work presented in BIBREF16, our experiments focus on Sensigrafo, the KG underlying Expert System's Cogito NLP proprietary platform. Similar to WordNet, on which Vecsigrafo has also been successfully trained, Sensigrafo is a general-purpose KG with lexical and semantic information that contains over 300K concepts, 400K lemmas and 80 types of relations rendering 3M links. We use Cogito to disambiguate the text corpora prior to training Vecsigrafo. All the semantic (lemma and concept) embeddings produced with HolE or Vecsigrafo are 100-D.\nIn this section, first we evaluate the actual FCC task against two supervised baselines. Then, we situate our work in the more general image-sentence matching problem, showing empirical evidence of the additional complexity associated to the scientific domain and the figure-caption case compared to natural images. Next, we test the visual and text features learnt in the FCC task in two different transfer learning settings: classification of scientific figures and captions and multi-modal machine comprehension for question answering given a context of text, figures and images.\nWe have used the following datasets for training and evaluation:\nThe Semantic Scholar corpus BIBREF21 (SemScholar) is a large dataset of scientific publications made available by AI2. From its 39M articles, we downloaded 3,3M PDFs (the rest were behind paywalls, did not have a link or it was broken) and extracted 12.5M figures and captions through PDFFigures2 BIBREF22. We randomly selected 500K papers to train the FCC task on their figures and captions and another 500K to train Vecsigrafo on the text of their titles and abstracts.\nSpringer Nature's SciGraph contains 7M scientific publications organized in 22 scientific fields or categories. Since SciGraph does not provide a link to the PDF of the publication, we selected the intersection with SemScholar, producing a smaller corpus of 80K papers (in addition to the 1M papers from SemScholar mentioned above) and 82K figures that we used for training certain FCC configurations and supervised baselines (section SECREF14).\nThe Textbook Question Answering corpus BIBREF23 includes 1,076 lessons and 26,260 multi-modal test questions from middle school science curricula. Its complexity and scope make it a challenging textual and visual question answering dataset.\nWikipedia. We used the January 2018 English Wikipedia dataset as one of the corpora on which to train Vecsigrafo. As opposed to SciGraph or SemScholar, specific of the scientific domain, Wikipedia is a source of general-purpose information.\nFlickr30K and COCO, as image-sentence matching benchmarks.\nWe evaluate our method in the task it was trained to solve: determining whether a figure and a caption correspond. We also compare the performance of the FCC task against two supervised baselines, training them on a classification task against the SciGraph taxonomy. For such baselines we first train the vision and language networks independently and then combine them. The feature extraction parts of both networks are the same as described in section SECREF6. On top of them, we attach a fully connected layer with 128 neurons and ReLU activation and a softmax layer, with as many neurons as target classes.\nThe direct combination baseline computes the figure-caption correspondence through the scalar product between the softmax outputs of both networks. If it exceeds a threshold, which we heuristically fixed on 0.325, the result is positive. The supervised pre-training baseline freezes the weights of the feature extraction trunks from the two trained networks, assembles them in the FCC architecture as shown in section SECREF6, and trains the FCC task on the fully connected layers. While direct combination provides a notion of the agreement between the two branches, supervised pre-training is the most similar supervised approach to our method.\nTable TABREF15 shows the results of the FCC task and the supervised baselines. $FCC_k$ denotes the corpus and word representation used to train the FCC task. Acc$_{vgg}$ shows the accuracy after replacing our visual branch with pre-trained VGG16 features learnt on ImageNet. This provides an estimate of how specific of the scientific domain scientific figures and therefore the resulting visual features can be, compared to natural images. As the table shows, the results obtained using pre-trained visual features are clearly worse in general (only slightly better in $FCC_3$), suggesting that the visual information contained in scientific figures indeed differs from natural images.\nWe trained the FCC network on two different scientific corpora: SciGraph ($FCC_{1-5}$) and SemScholar ($FCC_{6-7}$). Both $FCC_1$ and $FCC_6$ learnt their own word representations without transfer of any pre-trained knowledge. Even in its most basic form our approach substantially improves over the supervised baselines, confirming that the visual and language branches learn from each other and also that figure-caption correspondence is an effective source of free supervision.\nAdding pre-trained knowledge at the input layer of the language subnetwork provides an additional boost, particularly with lemma and concept embeddings from Vecsigrafo ($FCC_5$). Vecsigrafo clearly outperformed HolE ($FCC_3$), which was also beaten by pre-trained fastText BIBREF24 word embeddings ($FCC_2$) trained on SemScholar.\nSince graph-based KG embedding approaches like HolE only generate embeddings of the artifacts explicitly contained in the KG, this may indicate that Sensigrafo, the KG used in this task, provides a partial coverage of the scientific domain, as could be expected since we are using an off-the-shelf version. Deeper inspection shows that HolE only covers 20% of the lemmas in the SciGraph vocabulary. On the other hand, Vecsigrafo, trained on the same KG, also captures lexical information from the text corpora it is trained on, Wikipedia or SemScholar, raising lemma coverage to 42% and 47%, respectively.\nAlthough the size of Wikipedia is almost triple of our SemScholar corpus, training Vecsigrafo on the latter resulted in better FCC accuracy ($FCC_4$ vs. $FCC_5$), suggesting that domain relevance is more significant than sheer volume, in line with our previous findings in BIBREF25. Training FCC on SemScholar, much larger than SciGraph, further improves accuracy, as shown in $FCC_6$ and $FCC_7$.\nWe put our FCC task in the context of the more general problem of image-sentence matching through a bidirectional retrieval task where images are sought given a text query and vice versa. While table TABREF20 focuses on natural images datasets (Flickr30K and COCO), table TABREF21 shows results on scientific datasets (SciGraph and SemScholar) rich in scientific figures and diagrams. The selected baselines (Embedding network, 2WayNet, VSE++ and DSVE-loc) report results obtained on the Flickr30K and COCO datasets, which we also include in table TABREF20. Performance is measured in recall at k ($Rk$), with k={1,5,10}. From the baselines, we successfully reproduced DSVE-loc, using the code made available by the authors, and trained it on SciGraph and SemScholar.\nWe trained the FCC task on all the datasets, both in a totally unsupervised way and with pre-trained semantic embeddings (indicated with subscript $vec$), and executed the bidirectional retrieval task using the resulting text and visual features. We also experimented with pre-trained VGG16 visual features extracted from ImageNet (subscript $vgg$), with more than 14 million hand-annotated images. Following common practice in image-sentence matching, our splits are 1,000 samples for test and the rest for training.\nWe can see a marked division between the results obtained on natural images datasets (table TABREF20) and those focused on scientific figures (table TABREF21). In the former case, VSE++ and DSVE-loc clearly beat all the other approaches. In contrast, our model performs poorly on such datasets although results are ameliorated when we use pre-trained visual features from ImageNet (\"Oursvgg\" and \"Oursvgg-vec\"). Interestingly, the situation reverts with the scientific datasets. While the recall of DSVE-loc drops dramatically in SciGraph, and even more in SemScholar, our approach shows the opposite behavior in both figure and caption retrieval. Using visual features enriched with pre-trained semantic embeddings from Vecsigrafo during training of the FCC task further improves recall in the bidirectional retrieval task. Compared to natural images, the additional complexity of scientific figures and their caption texts, which in addition are considerably longer (see table TABREF19), seems to have a clear impact in this regard.\nUnlike in Flickr30K and COCO, replacing the FCC visual features with pre-trained ones from ImageNet brings us little benefit in SciGraph and even less in SemScholar, where the combination of FCC and Vecsigrafo (\"Oursvec\") obtains the best results across the board. This and the extremely poor performance of the best image-sentence matching baseline (DSVE-loc) in the scientific datasets shows evidence that dealing with scientific figures is considerably more complex than natural images. Indeed, the best results in figure-caption correspondence (\"Oursvec\" in SemScholar) are still far from the SoA in image-sentence matching (DSVE-loc in COCO).\nWe evaluate the language and visual representations emerging from FCC in the context of two classification tasks that aim to identify the scientific field an arbitrary text fragment (a caption) or a figure belong to, according to the SciGraph taxonomy. The latter is a particularly hard task due to the whimsical nature of the figures that appear in our corpus: figure and diagram layout is arbitrary; charts, e.g. bar and pie charts, are used to showcase data in any field from health to engineering; figures and natural images appear indistinctly, etc. Also, note that we only rely on the actual figure, not the text fragment where it is mentioned in the paper.\nWe pick the text and visual features that produced the best FCC results with and without pre-trained semantic embeddings (table TABREF15, $FCC_7$ and $FCC_6$, respectively) and use the language and vision subnetworks presented in section SECREF6 to train our classifiers on SciGraph in two different scenarios. First, we only fine tune the fully connected and softmax layers, freezing the text and visual weights (non-trainable in the table). Second, we fine tune all the parameters in both networks (trainable). In both cases, we compare against a baseline using the same networks initialized with random weights, without FCC training. In doing so, through the first, non-trainable scenario, we seek to quantify the information contributed by the FCC features, while training from scratch on the target corpus should provide an upper bound for figure and caption classification. Additionally, for figure classification, we select a baseline of frozen VGG16 weights trained on ImageNet. We train using 10-fold cross validation and Adam. For the caption classification task, we select learning rate $10^{-3}$ and batch size 128. In figure classification, we use learning rate $10^{-4}$, weight decay $10^{-5}$ and batch size 32.\nThe results in table TABREF23 show that our approach amply beats the baselines, including the upper bound (training from scratch on SciGraph). The delta is particularly noticeable in the non trainable case for both caption and figure classification and is considerably increased in \"Ours $FCC_7$\", which uses pre-trained semantic embeddings. This includes both the random and VGG baselines and illustrates again the additional complexity of analyzing scientific figures compared to natural images, even if the latter is trained on a considerably larger corpus like ImageNet. Fine tuning the whole networks on SciGraph further improves accuracies. In this case, \"Ours $FCC_6$\", which uses FCC features without additional pre-trained embeddings, slightly outperforms \"Ours $FCC_7$\", suggesting a larger margin to learn from the task-specific corpus. Note that both $FCC_6$ and $FCC_7$ were trained on SemScholar.\nWe leverage the TQA dataset and the baselines in BIBREF23 to evaluate the features learnt by the FCC task in a multi-modal machine comprehension scenario. We study how our model, which was not originally trained for this task, performs against state of the art models specifically trained for diagram question answering and textual reading comprehension in a very challenging dataset. We also study how pre-trained semantic embeddings impact in the TQA task: first, by enriching the visual features learnt in the FCC task as shown in section SECREF6 and then by using pre-trained semantic embeddings to enrich word representations in the TQA corpus.\nWe focus on multiple-choice questions, 73% of the dataset. Table TABREF24 shows the performance of our model against the results reported in BIBREF23 for five TQA baselines: random, BiDAF (focused on text machine comprehension), text only ($TQA_1$, based on MemoryNet), text+image ($TQA_2$, VQA), and text+diagrams ($TQA_3$, DSDP-NET). We successfully reproduced the $TQA_1$ and $TQA_2$ architectures and adapted the latter. Then, we replaced the visual features in $TQA_2$ with those learnt by the FCC visual subnetwork both in a completely unsupervised way ($FCC_6$ in table TABREF15) and with pre-trained semantic embeddings ($FCC_7$), resulting in $TQA_4$ and $TQA_5$, respectively.\nWhile $TQA_{1-5}$ used no pre-trained embeddings at all, $TQA_{6-10}$ were trained including pre-trained Vecsigrafo semantic embeddings. Unlike FCC, where we used concatenation to combine pre-trained lemma and concept embeddings with the word embeddings learnt by the task, element-wise addition worked best in the case of TQA.\nFollowing the recommendations in BIBREF23, we pre-processed the TQA corpus to i) consider knowledge from previous lessons in the textbook in addition to the lesson of the question at hand and ii) address challenges like long question contexts with a large lexicon. In both text and diagram MC, applying the Pareto principle to reduce the maximum token sequence length in the text of each question, their answers and context improved accuracy considerably. This optimization allowed reducing the amount of text to consider for each question, improving the signal to noise ratio. Finally, we obtained the most relevant paragraphs for each question through tf-idf and trained the models using 10-fold cross validation, Adam, learning rate $10^{-2}$ and batch size 128. In text MC we also used 0.5 dropout and recurrent dropout in the LSTM layers.\nFitting multi-modal sources into a single memory, the use of visual FCC features clearly outperforms all the TQA baselines in diagram MC. Enhancing word representation with pre-trained semantic embeddings during training of the TQA task provides an additional boost that results in the highest accuracies for both text MC and diagram MC. These are significantly good results since, according to the TQA authors BIBREF23, most diagram questions in the TQA corpus would normally require a specific rich diagram parse, which we did not aim to provide.\nWe inspect the features learnt by our FCC task to gain a deeper understanding of the syntactic and semantic patterns captured for figure and caption representation. The findings reported herein are qualitatively consistent for all the FCC variations in table TABREF15.\nVision features. The analysis was carried out on an unconstrained variety of charts, diagrams and natural images from SciGraph, without filtering by figure type or scientific field. To obtain a representative sample of what the FCC network learns, we focus on the 512-D vector resulting from the last convolutional block before the fusion subnetwork. We pick the features with the most significant activation over the whole dataset and select the figures that activate them most. To this purpose, we prioritize those with higher maximum activation against the average activation.\nFigure FIGREF27 shows a selection of 6 visual features with the 4 figures that activate each feature more significantly and their activation heatmaps. Only figures are used as input, no text. As can be seen, the vision subnetwork has automatically learnt, without explicit supervision, to recognize different types of diagrams, charts and content, such as (from left to right) whisker plots, western blots (a technique used to identify proteins in a tissue sample), multi-image comparison diagrams, multi-modal data visualization charts (e.g. western plots vs. bar charts), line plots, and text within the figures. Furthermore, as shown by the heatmaps, our model discriminates the key elements associated to the figures that most activate each feature: the actual whiskers, the blots, the borders of each image under comparison, the blots and their complementary bar charts, as well as the line plots and the correspondence between them and the values in the x and y axes. Also, see (right-most column) how a feature discriminates text inserted in the figure, regardless of the remaining elements that may appear and the connections between them. This shows evidence of how the visual features learnt by the FCC task support the parsing of complex scientific diagrams.\nWe also estimated a notion of semantic specificity based on the concepts of a KG. For each visual feature, we aggregated the captions of the figures that most activate it and used Cogito to disambiguate the Sensigrafo concepts that appear in them. Then, we estimated how important each concept is to each feature by calculating its tf-idf. Finally, we averaged the resulting values to obtain a consolidated semantic specificity score per feature.\nThe scores of the features in figure FIGREF27 range between 0.42 and 0.65, which is consistently higher than average (0.4). This seems to indicate a correlation between activation and the semantic specificity of each visual feature. For example, the heatmaps of the figures related to the feature with the lowest tf-idf (left-most column) highlights a particular visual pattern, i.e. the whiskers, that may spread over many, possibly unrelated domains. On the other hand, the feature with the highest score (second column) focuses on a type of diagrams, western blots, almost exclusive of protein and genetic studies. Others, like the feature illustrated by the figures in the fifth column, capture the semantics of a specific type of 2D charts relating two magnitudes x and y. Analyzing their captions with Cogito, we see that concepts like e.g. isochronal and exponential functions are mentioned. If we look at the second and four top-most figures in the column, we can see that such concepts are also visually depicted in the figures, suggesting that the FCC task has learnt to recognize them both from the text and visually.\nText features. Similar to the visual case, we selected the features from the last block of the language subnetwork with the highest activation. For visualization purposes, we picked the figures corresponding to the captions in SciGraph that most activate such features (figure FIGREF28). No visual information is used.\nSeveral distinct patterns emerge from the text. The text feature in the first column seems to focus on genetics and histochemistry, including terms like western blots or immunostaining and variations like immunoblot-s/ted/ting. Interestingly, it also seems to have learnt some type of is-a relations (western blot is a type of immunoblot). The second feature focuses on variations of the term radiograph, e.g. radiograph-y/s. The third feature specializes in text related to curve plots involving several statistic analysis, e.g. Real-time PCR, one-way ANOVA or Gaussian distribution. Sometimes (fourth figure from top) the caption does not mention the plot directly, but focuses on the analysis instead, e.g. \"the data presented here are mean values of duplicate experiments\", indicating transfer of knowledge from the visual part during training. The fourth feature extracts citations and models named after prominent scientists, e.g. Evans function (first and fourth figure), Manley (1992) (second), and Aliev-Panfilov model (third). The fifth feature extracts chromatography terminology, e.g. 3D surface plot, photomicrograph or color map and, finally, the right-most feature focuses on different types of named diagrams, like flow charts and state diagrams, e.g. phylogenetic trees.\nAll the captions show a strong semantic correspondence with their associated figures. Figure FIGREF29 shows the activation heatmaps for two sample captions, calculated on the embeddings layer of the language subnetwork. The upper one corresponds to the fourth column left-right and third figure top-down in figure FIGREF28. Its caption reads: \"The Aliev-Panfilov model with $\\alpha =0.01$...The phase portrait depicts trajectories for distinct initial values $\\varphi _0$ and $r_0$...\". Below, (first column, fourth figure in figure FIGREF28): \"Relative protein levels of ubiquitin-protein conjugates in M. quadriceps...A representative immunoblot specific to ubiquitin...\". Consistently with our analysis, activation focuses on the most relevant tokens for each text feature: \"Aliev-Panfilov model\" and \"immunoblot\", respectively.\nThere is a wealth of knowledge in scientific literature and only a fraction of it is text. However, understanding scientific figures is a challenging task for machines, which is beyond their ability to process natural images. In this paper, we provide empirical evidence of this and show that co-training text and visual features from a large corpus of scientific figures and their captions in a correspondence task (FCC) is an effective, flexible and elegant unsupervised means towards overcoming such complexity. We show how such features can be significantly improved by enriching them with additional knowledge sources and, particularly, structured KGs. We prove the benefits of our approach against supervised baselines and in different transfer learning tasks, including text and visual classification and multi-modal machine comprehension applied to question answering, with results generally beyond the state of the art. In the future, it will be interesting to further the study of the interplay between the semantic concepts explicitly represented in different KGs, contextualized embeddings e.g. from SciBERT BIBREF31, and the text and visual features learnt in the FCC task. We also plan to continue to charter the knowledge captured in such features and to pursue the optimization and practical application of our approach.\nThe research reported in this paper is supported by the EU Horizon 2020 programme, under grants European Language Grid-825627 and Co-inform-770302.", "question": "What language are the captions in?", "expected_output": "English.

{"id": "1909.09070", "prompt": "Scientific knowledge is heterogeneous and can present itself in many forms, including text, mathematical equations, figures and tables. Like many other manifestations of human thought, the scientific discourse usually adopts the form of a narrative, a scientific publication where related knowledge is presented in mutually supportive ways over different modalities. In the case of scientific figures, like charts, images and diagrams, these are usually accompanied by a text paragraph, a caption, that elaborates on the analysis otherwise visually represented.\nIn this paper, we make use of this observation and tap on the potential of learning from the enormous source of free supervision available in the scientific literature, with millions of figures and their captions. We build models that learn from the scientific discourse both visually and textually by simply looking at the figures and reading their explanatory captions, inspired in how humans learn by reading a scientific publication. To this purpose, we explore how multi-modal scientific knowledge can be learnt from the correspondence between figures and captions.\nThe main contributions of this paper are the following:\nAn unsupervised Figure-Caption Correspondence task (FCC) that jointly learns text and visual features useful to address a range of tasks involving scientific text and figures.\nA method to enrich such features with semantic knowledge transferred from structured knowledge graphs (KG).\nA study of the complexity of figure-caption correspondence compared to classical image-sentence matching.\nA qualitative and quantitative analysis of the learnt text and visual features through transfer learning tasks.\nA corpus of scientific figures and captions extracted from SN SciGraph and AI2 Semantic Scholar.\nWe present the FCC task in section SECREF3, including the network architecture, training protocol, and how adding pre-trained word and semantic embeddings can enrich the resulting text and visual features. In section SECREF4, we first introduce our datasets and evaluate the performance of our method in the task it was trained to solve, the correspondence between scientific figures and captions. Then, we relate our work to the state of the art in image-sentence matching and evaluate our approach in two challenging transfer learning tasks: caption and figure classification and multi-modal machine comprehension. In section SECREF5 we perform a qualitative study that illustrates how the FCC task leads to detailed textual and visual discrimination. Finally, in section SECREF6 we conclude the paper and advance future work.\nUnderstanding natural images has been a major area of research in computer vision, with well established datasets like ImageNet BIBREF0, Flickr8K BIBREF1, Flickr30K BIBREF2 and COCO BIBREF3. However, reasoning with other visual representations like scientific figures and diagrams has not received the same attention yet and entails additional challenges: Scientific figures are more abstract and symbolic, their captions tend to be significantly longer and use specialized lexicon, and the relation between a scientific figure and its caption is unique, i.e. in a scientific publication there is only one caption that corresponds with one figure and vice versa.\nThe FCC task presented herein is a form of co-training BIBREF4 where there are two views of the data and each view provides complementary information. Similar two-branch neural architectures focus on image-sentence BIBREF5, BIBREF6 and audio-video BIBREF7 matching. Others like BIBREF8 learn common embeddings from images and text. However, in such cases one or both networks are typically pre-trained.\nFocused on geometry, BIBREF9 maximize the agreement between text and visual data. In BIBREF10, the authors apply machine vision and natural language processing to extract data from figures and their associated text in bio-curation tasks. In BIBREF11, they parse diagram components and connectors as a Diagram Parse Graph (DPG), semantically interpret the DPG and use the model to answer diagram questions. While we rely on the correspondence between figures and captions, they train a specific classifier for each component and connector type and yet another model to ground the semantics of the DPG in each domain, like food webs or water cycles.\nKnowledge fusion approaches like BIBREF12 investigate the potential of complementing KG embeddings with text and natural images by integrating information across the three modalities in a single latent representation. They assume pre-trained entity representations exist in each individual modality, e.g. the visual features encoding the image of a ball, the word embeddings associated to the token \"ball\", and the KG embeddings related to the ball entity, which are then stitched together. In contrast, FCC co-trains text and visual features from figures and their captions and supports the enrichment of such features with lexical and semantic knowledge transferred from a KG during the training of the FCC task.\nThe main idea of our approach is to learn a correspondence task between scientific figures and their captions as they appear in a scientific publication. The information captured in the caption explains the corresponding figure in natural language, providing guidance to identify the key features of the figure and vice versa. By seeing a figure and reading the textual description in its caption we ultimately aim to learn representations that capture e.g. what it means that two plots are similar or what gravity looks like.\nWe leverage this observation to learn a figure-caption correspondence task. In essence, FCC is a binary classification task that receives a figure and a caption and determines whether they correspond or not. For training, the positive pairs are actual figures and their captions from a collection of scientific publications. Negative pairs are extracted from combinations of figures and any other randomly selected captions. The network is then made to learn text and visual features from scratch, without additional labelled data.\nWe propose a 2-branch neural architecture (figure FIGREF7) that has three main parts: the vision and language subnetworks, respectively extracting visual and text features, and a fusion subnetwork that takes the resulting features from the visual and text blocks and uses them to evaluate figure-caption correspondence.\nThe vision subnetwork follows a VGG-style BIBREF13 design, with 3x3 convolutional filters, 2x2 max-pooling layers with stride 2 and no padding. It contains 4 blocks of conv+conv+pool layers, where inside each block the two convolutional layers have the same number of filters, while consecutive blocks have doubling number of filters (64, 128, 256, 512). The input layer receives 224x224x3 images. The final layer produces a 512-D vector after 28x28 max-pooling. Each convolutional layer is followed by batch normalization BIBREF14 and ReLU layers. Based on BIBREF15, the language subnetwork has 3 convolutional blocks, each with 512 filters and a 5-element window size with ReLU activation. Each convolutional layer is followed by a 5-max pooling layer, except for the final layer, which produces a 512-D vector after 35-max pooling. The language subnetwork has a 300-D embeddings layer at the input, with a maximum sequence length of 1,000 tokens. The fusion subnetwork calculates the element-wise product of the 512-D visual and text feature vectors into a single vector $r$ to produce a 2-way classification output (correspond or not). It has two fully connected layers, with ReLU and an intermediate feature size of 128-D. The probability of each choice is the softmax of $r$, i.e. $\\hat{y} = softmax(r) \\in \\mathbb {R}^{2}$. During training, we minimize the negative log probability of the correct choice.\nThis architecture enables the FCC task to learn visual and text features from scratch in a completely unsupervised manner, just by observing the correspondence of figures and captions. Next, we extend it to enable the transfer of additional pre-trained information. Here, we focus on adding pre-trained embeddings on the language branch, and then back-propagate to the visual features during FCC training. Adding pre-trained visual features is also possible and indeed we also evaluate its impact in the FCC task in section SECREF14.\nLet $V$ be a vocabulary of words from a collection of documents $D$. Also, let $L$ be their lemmas, i.e. base forms without morphological or conjugational variations, and $C$ the concepts (or senses) in a KG. Each word $w_k$ in $V$, e.g. made, has one lemma $l_k$ (make) and may be linked to one or more concepts $c_k$ in $C$ (create or produce something).\nFor each word $w_k$, the FCC task learns a d-D embedding $\\vec{w}_k$, which can be combined with pre-trained word ($\\vec{w^{\\prime }}_k$), lemma ($\\vec{l}_k$) and concept ($\\vec{c}_k$) embeddings to produce a single vector $\\vec{t}_k$. If no pre-trained knowledge is transferred from an external source, then $\\vec{t}_k=\\vec{w}_k$. Note that we previously lemmatize and disambiguate $D$ against the KG in order to select the right pre-trained lemma and concept embeddings for each particular occurrence of $w_k$. Equation DISPLAY_FORM8 shows the different combinations of learnt and pre-trained embeddings we consider: (a) learnt word embeddings only, (b) learnt and pre-trained word embeddings and (c) learnt word embeddings and pre-trained semantic embeddings, including both lemmas and concepts, in line with our recent findings presented in BIBREF16.\nIn our experiments, concatenation proved optimal to combine the embeddings learnt by the network and the pre-trained embeddings, compared to other methods like summation, multiplication, average or learning a task-specific weighting of the different representations as in BIBREF17. Since some words may not have associated pre-trained word, lemma or concept embeddings, we pad these sequences with $\\varnothing _W$, $\\varnothing _L$ and $\\varnothing _C$, which are never included in the vocabulary. The dimensionality of $\\vec{t}_k$ is fixed to 300, i.e. the size of each sub-vector in configurations $(a)$, $(b)$ and $(c)$ is 300, 150 and 100, respectively. In doing so, we aimed at limiting the number of trainable parameters and balance the contribution of each information source.\nIn its most basic form, i.e. configuration $(a)$, the FCC network has over 32M trainable parameters (28M in the language subnetwork, 4M in the vision subnetwork and 135K in the fusion subnetwork) and takes 12 hours to train on a single GPU Nvidia GeForce RTX 2080 Ti for a relatively small corpus (SN SciGraph, see section SECREF12). We used 10-fold cross validation, Adam optimization BIBREF18 with learning rate $10^{-4}$ and weight decay $10^{-5}$. The network was implemented in Keras and TensorFlow, with batch size 32. The number of positive and negative cases is balanced within the batches.\nWe use HolE BIBREF19 and Vecsigrafo BIBREF16 to learn semantic embeddings. The latter extends the Swivel algorithm BIBREF20 to jointly learn word, lemma and concept embeddings on a corpus disambiguated against the KG, outperforming the previous state of the art in word and word-sense embeddings by co-training word, lemma and concept embeddings as opposed to training each individually. In contrast to Vecsigrafo, which requires both a text corpus and a KG, HolE follows a graph-based approach where embeddings are learnt exclusively from the KG. As section SECREF14 will show, this gives Vecsigrafo a certain advantage in the FCC task. Following up with the work presented in BIBREF16, our experiments focus on Sensigrafo, the KG underlying Expert System's Cogito NLP proprietary platform. Similar to WordNet, on which Vecsigrafo has also been successfully trained, Sensigrafo is a general-purpose KG with lexical and semantic information that contains over 300K concepts, 400K lemmas and 80 types of relations rendering 3M links. We use Cogito to disambiguate the text corpora prior to training Vecsigrafo. All the semantic (lemma and concept) embeddings produced with HolE or Vecsigrafo are 100-D.\nIn this section, first we evaluate the actual FCC task against two supervised baselines. Then, we situate our work in the more general image-sentence matching problem, showing empirical evidence of the additional complexity associated to the scientific domain and the figure-caption case compared to natural images. Next, we test the visual and text features learnt in the FCC task in two different transfer learning settings: classification of scientific figures and captions and multi-modal machine comprehension for question answering given a context of text, figures and images.\nWe have used the following datasets for training and evaluation:\nThe Semantic Scholar corpus BIBREF21 (SemScholar) is a large dataset of scientific publications made available by AI2. From its 39M articles, we downloaded 3,3M PDFs (the rest were behind paywalls, did not have a link or it was broken) and extracted 12.5M figures and captions through PDFFigures2 BIBREF22. We randomly selected 500K papers to train the FCC task on their figures and captions and another 500K to train Vecsigrafo on the text of their titles and abstracts.\nSpringer Nature's SciGraph contains 7M scientific publications organized in 22 scientific fields or categories. Since SciGraph does not provide a link to the PDF of the publication, we selected the intersection with SemScholar, producing a smaller corpus of 80K papers (in addition to the 1M papers from SemScholar mentioned above) and 82K figures that we used for training certain FCC configurations and supervised baselines (section SECREF14).\nThe Textbook Question Answering corpus BIBREF23 includes 1,076 lessons and 26,260 multi-modal test questions from middle school science curricula. Its complexity and scope make it a challenging textual and visual question answering dataset.\nWikipedia. We used the January 2018 English Wikipedia dataset as one of the corpora on which to train Vecsigrafo. As opposed to SciGraph or SemScholar, specific of the scientific domain, Wikipedia is a source of general-purpose information.\nFlickr30K and COCO, as image-sentence matching benchmarks.\nWe evaluate our method in the task it was trained to solve: determining whether a figure and a caption correspond. We also compare the performance of the FCC task against two supervised baselines, training them on a classification task against the SciGraph taxonomy. For such baselines we first train the vision and language networks independently and then combine them. The feature extraction parts of both networks are the same as described in section SECREF6. On top of them, we attach a fully connected layer with 128 neurons and ReLU activation and a softmax layer, with as many neurons as target classes.\nThe direct combination baseline computes the figure-caption correspondence through the scalar product between the softmax outputs of both networks. If it exceeds a threshold, which we heuristically fixed on 0.325, the result is positive. The supervised pre-training baseline freezes the weights of the feature extraction trunks from the two trained networks, assembles them in the FCC architecture as shown in section SECREF6, and trains the FCC task on the fully connected layers. While direct combination provides a notion of the agreement between the two branches, supervised pre-training is the most similar supervised approach to our method.\nTable TABREF15 shows the results of the FCC task and the supervised baselines. $FCC_k$ denotes the corpus and word representation used to train the FCC task. Acc$_{vgg}$ shows the accuracy after replacing our visual branch with pre-trained VGG16 features learnt on ImageNet. This provides an estimate of how specific of the scientific domain scientific figures and therefore the resulting visual features can be, compared to natural images. As the table shows, the results obtained using pre-trained visual features are clearly worse in general (only slightly better in $FCC_3$), suggesting that the visual information contained in scientific figures indeed differs from natural images.\nWe trained the FCC network on two different scientific corpora: SciGraph ($FCC_{1-5}$) and SemScholar ($FCC_{6-7}$). Both $FCC_1$ and $FCC_6$ learnt their own word representations without transfer of any pre-trained knowledge. Even in its most basic form our approach substantially improves over the supervised baselines, confirming that the visual and language branches learn from each other and also that figure-caption correspondence is an effective source of free supervision.\nAdding pre-trained knowledge at the input layer of the language subnetwork provides an additional boost, particularly with lemma and concept embeddings from Vecsigrafo ($FCC_5$). Vecsigrafo clearly outperformed HolE ($FCC_3$), which was also beaten by pre-trained fastText BIBREF24 word embeddings ($FCC_2$) trained on SemScholar.\nSince graph-based KG embedding approaches like HolE only generate embeddings of the artifacts explicitly contained in the KG, this may indicate that Sensigrafo, the KG used in this task, provides a partial coverage of the scientific domain, as could be expected since we are using an off-the-shelf version. Deeper inspection shows that HolE only covers 20% of the lemmas in the SciGraph vocabulary. On the other hand, Vecsigrafo, trained on the same KG, also captures lexical information from the text corpora it is trained on, Wikipedia or SemScholar, raising lemma coverage to 42% and 47%, respectively.\nAlthough the size of Wikipedia is almost triple of our SemScholar corpus, training Vecsigrafo on the latter resulted in better FCC accuracy ($FCC_4$ vs. $FCC_5$), suggesting that domain relevance is more significant than sheer volume, in line with our previous findings in BIBREF25. Training FCC on SemScholar, much larger than SciGraph, further improves accuracy, as shown in $FCC_6$ and $FCC_7$.\nWe put our FCC task in the context of the more general problem of image-sentence matching through a bidirectional retrieval task where images are sought given a text query and vice versa. While table TABREF20 focuses on natural images datasets (Flickr30K and COCO), table TABREF21 shows results on scientific datasets (SciGraph and SemScholar) rich in scientific figures and diagrams. The selected baselines (Embedding network, 2WayNet, VSE++ and DSVE-loc) report results obtained on the Flickr30K and COCO datasets, which we also include in table TABREF20. Performance is measured in recall at k ($Rk$), with k={1,5,10}. From the baselines, we successfully reproduced DSVE-loc, using the code made available by the authors, and trained it on SciGraph and SemScholar.\nWe trained the FCC task on all the datasets, both in a totally unsupervised way and with pre-trained semantic embeddings (indicated with subscript $vec$), and executed the bidirectional retrieval task using the resulting text and visual features. We also experimented with pre-trained VGG16 visual features extracted from ImageNet (subscript $vgg$), with more than 14 million hand-annotated images. Following common practice in image-sentence matching, our splits are 1,000 samples for test and the rest for training.\nWe can see a marked division between the results obtained on natural images datasets (table TABREF20) and those focused on scientific figures (table TABREF21). In the former case, VSE++ and DSVE-loc clearly beat all the other approaches. In contrast, our model performs poorly on such datasets although results are ameliorated when we use pre-trained visual features from ImageNet (\"Oursvgg\" and \"Oursvgg-vec\"). Interestingly, the situation reverts with the scientific datasets. While the recall of DSVE-loc drops dramatically in SciGraph, and even more in SemScholar, our approach shows the opposite behavior in both figure and caption retrieval. Using visual features enriched with pre-trained semantic embeddings from Vecsigrafo during training of the FCC task further improves recall in the bidirectional retrieval task. Compared to natural images, the additional complexity of scientific figures and their caption texts, which in addition are considerably longer (see table TABREF19), seems to have a clear impact in this regard.\nUnlike in Flickr30K and COCO, replacing the FCC visual features with pre-trained ones from ImageNet brings us little benefit in SciGraph and even less in SemScholar, where the combination of FCC and Vecsigrafo (\"Oursvec\") obtains the best results across the board. This and the extremely poor performance of the best image-sentence matching baseline (DSVE-loc) in the scientific datasets shows evidence that dealing with scientific figures is considerably more complex than natural images. Indeed, the best results in figure-caption correspondence (\"Oursvec\" in SemScholar) are still far from the SoA in image-sentence matching (DSVE-loc in COCO).\nWe evaluate the language and visual representations emerging from FCC in the context of two classification tasks that aim to identify the scientific field an arbitrary text fragment (a caption) or a figure belong to, according to the SciGraph taxonomy. The latter is a particularly hard task due to the whimsical nature of the figures that appear in our corpus: figure and diagram layout is arbitrary; charts, e.g. bar and pie charts, are used to showcase data in any field from health to engineering; figures and natural images appear indistinctly, etc. Also, note that we only rely on the actual figure, not the text fragment where it is mentioned in the paper.\nWe pick the text and visual features that produced the best FCC results with and without pre-trained semantic embeddings (table TABREF15, $FCC_7$ and $FCC_6$, respectively) and use the language and vision subnetworks presented in section SECREF6 to train our classifiers on SciGraph in two different scenarios. First, we only fine tune the fully connected and softmax layers, freezing the text and visual weights (non-trainable in the table). Second, we fine tune all the parameters in both networks (trainable). In both cases, we compare against a baseline using the same networks initialized with random weights, without FCC training. In doing so, through the first, non-trainable scenario, we seek to quantify the information contributed by the FCC features, while training from scratch on the target corpus should provide an upper bound for figure and caption classification. Additionally, for figure classification, we select a baseline of frozen VGG16 weights trained on ImageNet. We train using 10-fold cross validation and Adam. For the caption classification task, we select learning rate $10^{-3}$ and batch size 128. In figure classification, we use learning rate $10^{-4}$, weight decay $10^{-5}$ and batch size 32.\nThe results in table TABREF23 show that our approach amply beats the baselines, including the upper bound (training from scratch on SciGraph). The delta is particularly noticeable in the non trainable case for both caption and figure classification and is considerably increased in \"Ours $FCC_7$\", which uses pre-trained semantic embeddings. This includes both the random and VGG baselines and illustrates again the additional complexity of analyzing scientific figures compared to natural images, even if the latter is trained on a considerably larger corpus like ImageNet. Fine tuning the whole networks on SciGraph further improves accuracies. In this case, \"Ours $FCC_6$\", which uses FCC features without additional pre-trained embeddings, slightly outperforms \"Ours $FCC_7$\", suggesting a larger margin to learn from the task-specific corpus. Note that both $FCC_6$ and $FCC_7$ were trained on SemScholar.\nWe leverage the TQA dataset and the baselines in BIBREF23 to evaluate the features learnt by the FCC task in a multi-modal machine comprehension scenario. We study how our model, which was not originally trained for this task, performs against state of the art models specifically trained for diagram question answering and textual reading comprehension in a very challenging dataset. We also study how pre-trained semantic embeddings impact in the TQA task: first, by enriching the visual features learnt in the FCC task as shown in section SECREF6 and then by using pre-trained semantic embeddings to enrich word representations in the TQA corpus.\nWe focus on multiple-choice questions, 73% of the dataset. Table TABREF24 shows the performance of our model against the results reported in BIBREF23 for five TQA baselines: random, BiDAF (focused on text machine comprehension), text only ($TQA_1$, based on MemoryNet), text+image ($TQA_2$, VQA), and text+diagrams ($TQA_3$, DSDP-NET). We successfully reproduced the $TQA_1$ and $TQA_2$ architectures and adapted the latter. Then, we replaced the visual features in $TQA_2$ with those learnt by the FCC visual subnetwork both in a completely unsupervised way ($FCC_6$ in table TABREF15) and with pre-trained semantic embeddings ($FCC_7$), resulting in $TQA_4$ and $TQA_5$, respectively.\nWhile $TQA_{1-5}$ used no pre-trained embeddings at all, $TQA_{6-10}$ were trained including pre-trained Vecsigrafo semantic embeddings. Unlike FCC, where we used concatenation to combine pre-trained lemma and concept embeddings with the word embeddings learnt by the task, element-wise addition worked best in the case of TQA.\nFollowing the recommendations in BIBREF23, we pre-processed the TQA corpus to i) consider knowledge from previous lessons in the textbook in addition to the lesson of the question at hand and ii) address challenges like long question contexts with a large lexicon. In both text and diagram MC, applying the Pareto principle to reduce the maximum token sequence length in the text of each question, their answers and context improved accuracy considerably. This optimization allowed reducing the amount of text to consider for each question, improving the signal to noise ratio. Finally, we obtained the most relevant paragraphs for each question through tf-idf and trained the models using 10-fold cross validation, Adam, learning rate $10^{-2}$ and batch size 128. In text MC we also used 0.5 dropout and recurrent dropout in the LSTM layers.\nFitting multi-modal sources into a single memory, the use of visual FCC features clearly outperforms all the TQA baselines in diagram MC. Enhancing word representation with pre-trained semantic embeddings during training of the TQA task provides an additional boost that results in the highest accuracies for both text MC and diagram MC. These are significantly good results since, according to the TQA authors BIBREF23, most diagram questions in the TQA corpus would normally require a specific rich diagram parse, which we did not aim to provide.\nWe inspect the features learnt by our FCC task to gain a deeper understanding of the syntactic and semantic patterns captured for figure and caption representation. The findings reported herein are qualitatively consistent for all the FCC variations in table TABREF15.\nVision features. The analysis was carried out on an unconstrained variety of charts, diagrams and natural images from SciGraph, without filtering by figure type or scientific field. To obtain a representative sample of what the FCC network learns, we focus on the 512-D vector resulting from the last convolutional block before the fusion subnetwork. We pick the features with the most significant activation over the whole dataset and select the figures that activate them most. To this purpose, we prioritize those with higher maximum activation against the average activation.\nFigure FIGREF27 shows a selection of 6 visual features with the 4 figures that activate each feature more significantly and their activation heatmaps. Only figures are used as input, no text. As can be seen, the vision subnetwork has automatically learnt, without explicit supervision, to recognize different types of diagrams, charts and content, such as (from left to right) whisker plots, western blots (a technique used to identify proteins in a tissue sample), multi-image comparison diagrams, multi-modal data visualization charts (e.g. western plots vs. bar charts), line plots, and text within the figures. Furthermore, as shown by the heatmaps, our model discriminates the key elements associated to the figures that most activate each feature: the actual whiskers, the blots, the borders of each image under comparison, the blots and their complementary bar charts, as well as the line plots and the correspondence between them and the values in the x and y axes. Also, see (right-most column) how a feature discriminates text inserted in the figure, regardless of the remaining elements that may appear and the connections between them. This shows evidence of how the visual features learnt by the FCC task support the parsing of complex scientific diagrams.\nWe also estimated a notion of semantic specificity based on the concepts of a KG. For each visual feature, we aggregated the captions of the figures that most activate it and used Cogito to disambiguate the Sensigrafo concepts that appear in them. Then, we estimated how important each concept is to each feature by calculating its tf-idf. Finally, we averaged the resulting values to obtain a consolidated semantic specificity score per feature.\nThe scores of the features in figure FIGREF27 range between 0.42 and 0.65, which is consistently higher than average (0.4). This seems to indicate a correlation between activation and the semantic specificity of each visual feature. For example, the heatmaps of the figures related to the feature with the lowest tf-idf (left-most column) highlights a particular visual pattern, i.e. the whiskers, that may spread over many, possibly unrelated domains. On the other hand, the feature with the highest score (second column) focuses on a type of diagrams, western blots, almost exclusive of protein and genetic studies. Others, like the feature illustrated by the figures in the fifth column, capture the semantics of a specific type of 2D charts relating two magnitudes x and y. Analyzing their captions with Cogito, we see that concepts like e.g. isochronal and exponential functions are mentioned. If we look at the second and four top-most figures in the column, we can see that such concepts are also visually depicted in the figures, suggesting that the FCC task has learnt to recognize them both from the text and visually.\nText features. Similar to the visual case, we selected the features from the last block of the language subnetwork with the highest activation. For visualization purposes, we picked the figures corresponding to the captions in SciGraph that most activate such features (figure FIGREF28). No visual information is used.\nSeveral distinct patterns emerge from the text. The text feature in the first column seems to focus on genetics and histochemistry, including terms like western blots or immunostaining and variations like immunoblot-s/ted/ting. Interestingly, it also seems to have learnt some type of is-a relations (western blot is a type of immunoblot). The second feature focuses on variations of the term radiograph, e.g. radiograph-y/s. The third feature specializes in text related to curve plots involving several statistic analysis, e.g. Real-time PCR, one-way ANOVA or Gaussian distribution. Sometimes (fourth figure from top) the caption does not mention the plot directly, but focuses on the analysis instead, e.g. \"the data presented here are mean values of duplicate experiments\", indicating transfer of knowledge from the visual part during training. The fourth feature extracts citations and models named after prominent scientists, e.g. Evans function (first and fourth figure), Manley (1992) (second), and Aliev-Panfilov model (third). The fifth feature extracts chromatography terminology, e.g. 3D surface plot, photomicrograph or color map and, finally, the right-most feature focuses on different types of named diagrams, like flow charts and state diagrams, e.g. phylogenetic trees.\nAll the captions show a strong semantic correspondence with their associated figures. Figure FIGREF29 shows the activation heatmaps for two sample captions, calculated on the embeddings layer of the language subnetwork. The upper one corresponds to the fourth column left-right and third figure top-down in figure FIGREF28. Its caption reads: \"The Aliev-Panfilov model with $\\alpha =0.01$...The phase portrait depicts trajectories for distinct initial values $\\varphi _0$ and $r_0$...\". Below, (first column, fourth figure in figure FIGREF28): \"Relative protein levels of ubiquitin-protein conjugates in M. quadriceps...A representative immunoblot specific to ubiquitin...\". Consistently with our analysis, activation focuses on the most relevant tokens for each text feature: \"Aliev-Panfilov model\" and \"immunoblot\", respectively.\nThere is a wealth of knowledge in scientific literature and only a fraction of it is text. However, understanding scientific figures is a challenging task for machines, which is beyond their ability to process natural images. In this paper, we provide empirical evidence of this and show that co-training text and visual features from a large corpus of scientific figures and their captions in a correspondence task (FCC) is an effective, flexible and elegant unsupervised means towards overcoming such complexity. We show how such features can be significantly improved by enriching them with additional knowledge sources and, particularly, structured KGs. We prove the benefits of our approach against supervised baselines and in different transfer learning tasks, including text and visual classification and multi-modal machine comprehension applied to question answering, with results generally beyond the state of the art. In the future, it will be interesting to further the study of the interplay between the semantic concepts explicitly represented in different KGs, contextualized embeddings e.g. from SciBERT BIBREF31, and the text and visual features learnt in the FCC task. We also plan to continue to charter the knowledge captured in such features and to pursue the optimization and practical application of our approach.\nThe research reported in this paper is supported by the EU Horizon 2020 programme, under grants European Language Grid-825627 and Co-inform-770302.", "question": "What ad-hoc approaches are explored?", "expected_output": "HolE.

{"id": "1909.09070", "prompt": "Scientific knowledge is heterogeneous and can present itself in many forms, including text, mathematical equations, figures and tables. Like many other manifestations of human thought, the scientific discourse usually adopts the form of a narrative, a scientific publication where related knowledge is presented in mutually supportive ways over different modalities. In the case of scientific figures, like charts, images and diagrams, these are usually accompanied by a text paragraph, a caption, that elaborates on the analysis otherwise visually represented.\nIn this paper, we make use of this observation and tap on the potential of learning from the enormous source of free supervision available in the scientific literature, with millions of figures and their captions. We build models that learn from the scientific discourse both visually and textually by simply looking at the figures and reading their explanatory captions, inspired in how humans learn by reading a scientific publication. To this purpose, we explore how multi-modal scientific knowledge can be learnt from the correspondence between figures and captions.\nThe main contributions of this paper are the following:\nAn unsupervised Figure-Caption Correspondence task (FCC) that jointly learns text and visual features useful to address a range of tasks involving scientific text and figures.\nA method to enrich such features with semantic knowledge transferred from structured knowledge graphs (KG).\nA study of the complexity of figure-caption correspondence compared to classical image-sentence matching.\nA qualitative and quantitative analysis of the learnt text and visual features through transfer learning tasks.\nA corpus of scientific figures and captions extracted from SN SciGraph and AI2 Semantic Scholar.\nWe present the FCC task in section SECREF3, including the network architecture, training protocol, and how adding pre-trained word and semantic embeddings can enrich the resulting text and visual features. In section SECREF4, we first introduce our datasets and evaluate the performance of our method in the task it was trained to solve, the correspondence between scientific figures and captions. Then, we relate our work to the state of the art in image-sentence matching and evaluate our approach in two challenging transfer learning tasks: caption and figure classification and multi-modal machine comprehension. In section SECREF5 we perform a qualitative study that illustrates how the FCC task leads to detailed textual and visual discrimination. Finally, in section SECREF6 we conclude the paper and advance future work.\nUnderstanding natural images has been a major area of research in computer vision, with well established datasets like ImageNet BIBREF0, Flickr8K BIBREF1, Flickr30K BIBREF2 and COCO BIBREF3. However, reasoning with other visual representations like scientific figures and diagrams has not received the same attention yet and entails additional challenges: Scientific figures are more abstract and symbolic, their captions tend to be significantly longer and use specialized lexicon, and the relation between a scientific figure and its caption is unique, i.e. in a scientific publication there is only one caption that corresponds with one figure and vice versa.\nThe FCC task presented herein is a form of co-training BIBREF4 where there are two views of the data and each view provides complementary information. Similar two-branch neural architectures focus on image-sentence BIBREF5, BIBREF6 and audio-video BIBREF7 matching. Others like BIBREF8 learn common embeddings from images and text. However, in such cases one or both networks are typically pre-trained.\nFocused on geometry, BIBREF9 maximize the agreement between text and visual data. In BIBREF10, the authors apply machine vision and natural language processing to extract data from figures and their associated text in bio-curation tasks. In BIBREF11, they parse diagram components and connectors as a Diagram Parse Graph (DPG), semantically interpret the DPG and use the model to answer diagram questions. While we rely on the correspondence between figures and captions, they train a specific classifier for each component and connector type and yet another model to ground the semantics of the DPG in each domain, like food webs or water cycles.\nKnowledge fusion approaches like BIBREF12 investigate the potential of complementing KG embeddings with text and natural images by integrating information across the three modalities in a single latent representation. They assume pre-trained entity representations exist in each individual modality, e.g. the visual features encoding the image of a ball, the word embeddings associated to the token \"ball\", and the KG embeddings related to the ball entity, which are then stitched together. In contrast, FCC co-trains text and visual features from figures and their captions and supports the enrichment of such features with lexical and semantic knowledge transferred from a KG during the training of the FCC task.\nThe main idea of our approach is to learn a correspondence task between scientific figures and their captions as they appear in a scientific publication. The information captured in the caption explains the corresponding figure in natural language, providing guidance to identify the key features of the figure and vice versa. By seeing a figure and reading the textual description in its caption we ultimately aim to learn representations that capture e.g. what it means that two plots are similar or what gravity looks like.\nWe leverage this observation to learn a figure-caption correspondence task. In essence, FCC is a binary classification task that receives a figure and a caption and determines whether they correspond or not. For training, the positive pairs are actual figures and their captions from a collection of scientific publications. Negative pairs are extracted from combinations of figures and any other randomly selected captions. The network is then made to learn text and visual features from scratch, without additional labelled data.\nWe propose a 2-branch neural architecture (figure FIGREF7) that has three main parts: the vision and language subnetworks, respectively extracting visual and text features, and a fusion subnetwork that takes the resulting features from the visual and text blocks and uses them to evaluate figure-caption correspondence.\nThe vision subnetwork follows a VGG-style BIBREF13 design, with 3x3 convolutional filters, 2x2 max-pooling layers with stride 2 and no padding. It contains 4 blocks of conv+conv+pool layers, where inside each block the two convolutional layers have the same number of filters, while consecutive blocks have doubling number of filters (64, 128, 256, 512). The input layer receives 224x224x3 images. The final layer produces a 512-D vector after 28x28 max-pooling. Each convolutional layer is followed by batch normalization BIBREF14 and ReLU layers. Based on BIBREF15, the language subnetwork has 3 convolutional blocks, each with 512 filters and a 5-element window size with ReLU activation. Each convolutional layer is followed by a 5-max pooling layer, except for the final layer, which produces a 512-D vector after 35-max pooling. The language subnetwork has a 300-D embeddings layer at the input, with a maximum sequence length of 1,000 tokens. The fusion subnetwork calculates the element-wise product of the 512-D visual and text feature vectors into a single vector $r$ to produce a 2-way classification output (correspond or not). It has two fully connected layers, with ReLU and an intermediate feature size of 128-D. The probability of each choice is the softmax of $r$, i.e. $\\hat{y} = softmax(r) \\in \\mathbb {R}^{2}$. During training, we minimize the negative log probability of the correct choice.\nThis architecture enables the FCC task to learn visual and text features from scratch in a completely unsupervised manner, just by observing the correspondence of figures and captions. Next, we extend it to enable the transfer of additional pre-trained information. Here, we focus on adding pre-trained embeddings on the language branch, and then back-propagate to the visual features during FCC training. Adding pre-trained visual features is also possible and indeed we also evaluate its impact in the FCC task in section SECREF14.\nLet $V$ be a vocabulary of words from a collection of documents $D$. Also, let $L$ be their lemmas, i.e. base forms without morphological or conjugational variations, and $C$ the concepts (or senses) in a KG. Each word $w_k$ in $V$, e.g. made, has one lemma $l_k$ (make) and may be linked to one or more concepts $c_k$ in $C$ (create or produce something).\nFor each word $w_k$, the FCC task learns a d-D embedding $\\vec{w}_k$, which can be combined with pre-trained word ($\\vec{w^{\\prime }}_k$), lemma ($\\vec{l}_k$) and concept ($\\vec{c}_k$) embeddings to produce a single vector $\\vec{t}_k$. If no pre-trained knowledge is transferred from an external source, then $\\vec{t}_k=\\vec{w}_k$. Note that we previously lemmatize and disambiguate $D$ against the KG in order to select the right pre-trained lemma and concept embeddings for each particular occurrence of $w_k$. Equation DISPLAY_FORM8 shows the different combinations of learnt and pre-trained embeddings we consider: (a) learnt word embeddings only, (b) learnt and pre-trained word embeddings and (c) learnt word embeddings and pre-trained semantic embeddings, including both lemmas and concepts, in line with our recent findings presented in BIBREF16.\nIn our experiments, concatenation proved optimal to combine the embeddings learnt by the network and the pre-trained embeddings, compared to other methods like summation, multiplication, average or learning a task-specific weighting of the different representations as in BIBREF17. Since some words may not have associated pre-trained word, lemma or concept embeddings, we pad these sequences with $\\varnothing _W$, $\\varnothing _L$ and $\\varnothing _C$, which are never included in the vocabulary. The dimensionality of $\\vec{t}_k$ is fixed to 300, i.e. the size of each sub-vector in configurations $(a)$, $(b)$ and $(c)$ is 300, 150 and 100, respectively. In doing so, we aimed at limiting the number of trainable parameters and balance the contribution of each information source.\nIn its most basic form, i.e. configuration $(a)$, the FCC network has over 32M trainable parameters (28M in the language subnetwork, 4M in the vision subnetwork and 135K in the fusion subnetwork) and takes 12 hours to train on a single GPU Nvidia GeForce RTX 2080 Ti for a relatively small corpus (SN SciGraph, see section SECREF12). We used 10-fold cross validation, Adam optimization BIBREF18 with learning rate $10^{-4}$ and weight decay $10^{-5}$. The network was implemented in Keras and TensorFlow, with batch size 32. The number of positive and negative cases is balanced within the batches.\nWe use HolE BIBREF19 and Vecsigrafo BIBREF16 to learn semantic embeddings. The latter extends the Swivel algorithm BIBREF20 to jointly learn word, lemma and concept embeddings on a corpus disambiguated against the KG, outperforming the previous state of the art in word and word-sense embeddings by co-training word, lemma and concept embeddings as opposed to training each individually. In contrast to Vecsigrafo, which requires both a text corpus and a KG, HolE follows a graph-based approach where embeddings are learnt exclusively from the KG. As section SECREF14 will show, this gives Vecsigrafo a certain advantage in the FCC task. Following up with the work presented in BIBREF16, our experiments focus on Sensigrafo, the KG underlying Expert System's Cogito NLP proprietary platform. Similar to WordNet, on which Vecsigrafo has also been successfully trained, Sensigrafo is a general-purpose KG with lexical and semantic information that contains over 300K concepts, 400K lemmas and 80 types of relations rendering 3M links. We use Cogito to disambiguate the text corpora prior to training Vecsigrafo. All the semantic (lemma and concept) embeddings produced with HolE or Vecsigrafo are 100-D.\nIn this section, first we evaluate the actual FCC task against two supervised baselines. Then, we situate our work in the more general image-sentence matching problem, showing empirical evidence of the additional complexity associated to the scientific domain and the figure-caption case compared to natural images. Next, we test the visual and text features learnt in the FCC task in two different transfer learning settings: classification of scientific figures and captions and multi-modal machine comprehension for question answering given a context of text, figures and images.\nWe have used the following datasets for training and evaluation:\nThe Semantic Scholar corpus BIBREF21 (SemScholar) is a large dataset of scientific publications made available by AI2. From its 39M articles, we downloaded 3,3M PDFs (the rest were behind paywalls, did not have a link or it was broken) and extracted 12.5M figures and captions through PDFFigures2 BIBREF22. We randomly selected 500K papers to train the FCC task on their figures and captions and another 500K to train Vecsigrafo on the text of their titles and abstracts.\nSpringer Nature's SciGraph contains 7M scientific publications organized in 22 scientific fields or categories. Since SciGraph does not provide a link to the PDF of the publication, we selected the intersection with SemScholar, producing a smaller corpus of 80K papers (in addition to the 1M papers from SemScholar mentioned above) and 82K figures that we used for training certain FCC configurations and supervised baselines (section SECREF14).\nThe Textbook Question Answering corpus BIBREF23 includes 1,076 lessons and 26,260 multi-modal test questions from middle school science curricula. Its complexity and scope make it a challenging textual and visual question answering dataset.\nWikipedia. We used the January 2018 English Wikipedia dataset as one of the corpora on which to train Vecsigrafo. As opposed to SciGraph or SemScholar, specific of the scientific domain, Wikipedia is a source of general-purpose information.\nFlickr30K and COCO, as image-sentence matching benchmarks.\nWe evaluate our method in the task it was trained to solve: determining whether a figure and a caption correspond. We also compare the performance of the FCC task against two supervised baselines, training them on a classification task against the SciGraph taxonomy. For such baselines we first train the vision and language networks independently and then combine them. The feature extraction parts of both networks are the same as described in section SECREF6. On top of them, we attach a fully connected layer with 128 neurons and ReLU activation and a softmax layer, with as many neurons as target classes.\nThe direct combination baseline computes the figure-caption correspondence through the scalar product between the softmax outputs of both networks. If it exceeds a threshold, which we heuristically fixed on 0.325, the result is positive. The supervised pre-training baseline freezes the weights of the feature extraction trunks from the two trained networks, assembles them in the FCC architecture as shown in section SECREF6, and trains the FCC task on the fully connected layers. While direct combination provides a notion of the agreement between the two branches, supervised pre-training is the most similar supervised approach to our method.\nTable TABREF15 shows the results of the FCC task and the supervised baselines. $FCC_k$ denotes the corpus and word representation used to train the FCC task. Acc$_{vgg}$ shows the accuracy after replacing our visual branch with pre-trained VGG16 features learnt on ImageNet. This provides an estimate of how specific of the scientific domain scientific figures and therefore the resulting visual features can be, compared to natural images. As the table shows, the results obtained using pre-trained visual features are clearly worse in general (only slightly better in $FCC_3$), suggesting that the visual information contained in scientific figures indeed differs from natural images.\nWe trained the FCC network on two different scientific corpora: SciGraph ($FCC_{1-5}$) and SemScholar ($FCC_{6-7}$). Both $FCC_1$ and $FCC_6$ learnt their own word representations without transfer of any pre-trained knowledge. Even in its most basic form our approach substantially improves over the supervised baselines, confirming that the visual and language branches learn from each other and also that figure-caption correspondence is an effective source of free supervision.\nAdding pre-trained knowledge at the input layer of the language subnetwork provides an additional boost, particularly with lemma and concept embeddings from Vecsigrafo ($FCC_5$). Vecsigrafo clearly outperformed HolE ($FCC_3$), which was also beaten by pre-trained fastText BIBREF24 word embeddings ($FCC_2$) trained on SemScholar.\nSince graph-based KG embedding approaches like HolE only generate embeddings of the artifacts explicitly contained in the KG, this may indicate that Sensigrafo, the KG used in this task, provides a partial coverage of the scientific domain, as could be expected since we are using an off-the-shelf version. Deeper inspection shows that HolE only covers 20% of the lemmas in the SciGraph vocabulary. On the other hand, Vecsigrafo, trained on the same KG, also captures lexical information from the text corpora it is trained on, Wikipedia or SemScholar, raising lemma coverage to 42% and 47%, respectively.\nAlthough the size of Wikipedia is almost triple of our SemScholar corpus, training Vecsigrafo on the latter resulted in better FCC accuracy ($FCC_4$ vs. $FCC_5$), suggesting that domain relevance is more significant than sheer volume, in line with our previous findings in BIBREF25. Training FCC on SemScholar, much larger than SciGraph, further improves accuracy, as shown in $FCC_6$ and $FCC_7$.\nWe put our FCC task in the context of the more general problem of image-sentence matching through a bidirectional retrieval task where images are sought given a text query and vice versa. While table TABREF20 focuses on natural images datasets (Flickr30K and COCO), table TABREF21 shows results on scientific datasets (SciGraph and SemScholar) rich in scientific figures and diagrams. The selected baselines (Embedding network, 2WayNet, VSE++ and DSVE-loc) report results obtained on the Flickr30K and COCO datasets, which we also include in table TABREF20. Performance is measured in recall at k ($Rk$), with k={1,5,10}. From the baselines, we successfully reproduced DSVE-loc, using the code made available by the authors, and trained it on SciGraph and SemScholar.\nWe trained the FCC task on all the datasets, both in a totally unsupervised way and with pre-trained semantic embeddings (indicated with subscript $vec$), and executed the bidirectional retrieval task using the resulting text and visual features. We also experimented with pre-trained VGG16 visual features extracted from ImageNet (subscript $vgg$), with more than 14 million hand-annotated images. Following common practice in image-sentence matching, our splits are 1,000 samples for test and the rest for training.\nWe can see a marked division between the results obtained on natural images datasets (table TABREF20) and those focused on scientific figures (table TABREF21). In the former case, VSE++ and DSVE-loc clearly beat all the other approaches. In contrast, our model performs poorly on such datasets although results are ameliorated when we use pre-trained visual features from ImageNet (\"Oursvgg\" and \"Oursvgg-vec\"). Interestingly, the situation reverts with the scientific datasets. While the recall of DSVE-loc drops dramatically in SciGraph, and even more in SemScholar, our approach shows the opposite behavior in both figure and caption retrieval. Using visual features enriched with pre-trained semantic embeddings from Vecsigrafo during training of the FCC task further improves recall in the bidirectional retrieval task. Compared to natural images, the additional complexity of scientific figures and their caption texts, which in addition are considerably longer (see table TABREF19), seems to have a clear impact in this regard.\nUnlike in Flickr30K and COCO, replacing the FCC visual features with pre-trained ones from ImageNet brings us little benefit in SciGraph and even less in SemScholar, where the combination of FCC and Vecsigrafo (\"Oursvec\") obtains the best results across the board. This and the extremely poor performance of the best image-sentence matching baseline (DSVE-loc) in the scientific datasets shows evidence that dealing with scientific figures is considerably more complex than natural images. Indeed, the best results in figure-caption correspondence (\"Oursvec\" in SemScholar) are still far from the SoA in image-sentence matching (DSVE-loc in COCO).\nWe evaluate the language and visual representations emerging from FCC in the context of two classification tasks that aim to identify the scientific field an arbitrary text fragment (a caption) or a figure belong to, according to the SciGraph taxonomy. The latter is a particularly hard task due to the whimsical nature of the figures that appear in our corpus: figure and diagram layout is arbitrary; charts, e.g. bar and pie charts, are used to showcase data in any field from health to engineering; figures and natural images appear indistinctly, etc. Also, note that we only rely on the actual figure, not the text fragment where it is mentioned in the paper.\nWe pick the text and visual features that produced the best FCC results with and without pre-trained semantic embeddings (table TABREF15, $FCC_7$ and $FCC_6$, respectively) and use the language and vision subnetworks presented in section SECREF6 to train our classifiers on SciGraph in two different scenarios. First, we only fine tune the fully connected and softmax layers, freezing the text and visual weights (non-trainable in the table). Second, we fine tune all the parameters in both networks (trainable). In both cases, we compare against a baseline using the same networks initialized with random weights, without FCC training. In doing so, through the first, non-trainable scenario, we seek to quantify the information contributed by the FCC features, while training from scratch on the target corpus should provide an upper bound for figure and caption classification. Additionally, for figure classification, we select a baseline of frozen VGG16 weights trained on ImageNet. We train using 10-fold cross validation and Adam. For the caption classification task, we select learning rate $10^{-3}$ and batch size 128. In figure classification, we use learning rate $10^{-4}$, weight decay $10^{-5}$ and batch size 32.\nThe results in table TABREF23 show that our approach amply beats the baselines, including the upper bound (training from scratch on SciGraph). The delta is particularly noticeable in the non trainable case for both caption and figure classification and is considerably increased in \"Ours $FCC_7$\", which uses pre-trained semantic embeddings. This includes both the random and VGG baselines and illustrates again the additional complexity of analyzing scientific figures compared to natural images, even if the latter is trained on a considerably larger corpus like ImageNet. Fine tuning the whole networks on SciGraph further improves accuracies. In this case, \"Ours $FCC_6$\", which uses FCC features without additional pre-trained embeddings, slightly outperforms \"Ours $FCC_7$\", suggesting a larger margin to learn from the task-specific corpus. Note that both $FCC_6$ and $FCC_7$ were trained on SemScholar.\nWe leverage the TQA dataset and the baselines in BIBREF23 to evaluate the features learnt by the FCC task in a multi-modal machine comprehension scenario. We study how our model, which was not originally trained for this task, performs against state of the art models specifically trained for diagram question answering and textual reading comprehension in a very challenging dataset. We also study how pre-trained semantic embeddings impact in the TQA task: first, by enriching the visual features learnt in the FCC task as shown in section SECREF6 and then by using pre-trained semantic embeddings to enrich word representations in the TQA corpus.\nWe focus on multiple-choice questions, 73% of the dataset. Table TABREF24 shows the performance of our model against the results reported in BIBREF23 for five TQA baselines: random, BiDAF (focused on text machine comprehension), text only ($TQA_1$, based on MemoryNet), text+image ($TQA_2$, VQA), and text+diagrams ($TQA_3$, DSDP-NET). We successfully reproduced the $TQA_1$ and $TQA_2$ architectures and adapted the latter. Then, we replaced the visual features in $TQA_2$ with those learnt by the FCC visual subnetwork both in a completely unsupervised way ($FCC_6$ in table TABREF15) and with pre-trained semantic embeddings ($FCC_7$), resulting in $TQA_4$ and $TQA_5$, respectively.\nWhile $TQA_{1-5}$ used no pre-trained embeddings at all, $TQA_{6-10}$ were trained including pre-trained Vecsigrafo semantic embeddings. Unlike FCC, where we used concatenation to combine pre-trained lemma and concept embeddings with the word embeddings learnt by the task, element-wise addition worked best in the case of TQA.\nFollowing the recommendations in BIBREF23, we pre-processed the TQA corpus to i) consider knowledge from previous lessons in the textbook in addition to the lesson of the question at hand and ii) address challenges like long question contexts with a large lexicon. In both text and diagram MC, applying the Pareto principle to reduce the maximum token sequence length in the text of each question, their answers and context improved accuracy considerably. This optimization allowed reducing the amount of text to consider for each question, improving the signal to noise ratio. Finally, we obtained the most relevant paragraphs for each question through tf-idf and trained the models using 10-fold cross validation, Adam, learning rate $10^{-2}$ and batch size 128. In text MC we also used 0.5 dropout and recurrent dropout in the LSTM layers.\nFitting multi-modal sources into a single memory, the use of visual FCC features clearly outperforms all the TQA baselines in diagram MC. Enhancing word representation with pre-trained semantic embeddings during training of the TQA task provides an additional boost that results in the highest accuracies for both text MC and diagram MC. These are significantly good results since, according to the TQA authors BIBREF23, most diagram questions in the TQA corpus would normally require a specific rich diagram parse, which we did not aim to provide.\nWe inspect the features learnt by our FCC task to gain a deeper understanding of the syntactic and semantic patterns captured for figure and caption representation. The findings reported herein are qualitatively consistent for all the FCC variations in table TABREF15.\nVision features. The analysis was carried out on an unconstrained variety of charts, diagrams and natural images from SciGraph, without filtering by figure type or scientific field. To obtain a representative sample of what the FCC network learns, we focus on the 512-D vector resulting from the last convolutional block before the fusion subnetwork. We pick the features with the most significant activation over the whole dataset and select the figures that activate them most. To this purpose, we prioritize those with higher maximum activation against the average activation.\nFigure FIGREF27 shows a selection of 6 visual features with the 4 figures that activate each feature more significantly and their activation heatmaps. Only figures are used as input, no text. As can be seen, the vision subnetwork has automatically learnt, without explicit supervision, to recognize different types of diagrams, charts and content, such as (from left to right) whisker plots, western blots (a technique used to identify proteins in a tissue sample), multi-image comparison diagrams, multi-modal data visualization charts (e.g. western plots vs. bar charts), line plots, and text within the figures. Furthermore, as shown by the heatmaps, our model discriminates the key elements associated to the figures that most activate each feature: the actual whiskers, the blots, the borders of each image under comparison, the blots and their complementary bar charts, as well as the line plots and the correspondence between them and the values in the x and y axes. Also, see (right-most column) how a feature discriminates text inserted in the figure, regardless of the remaining elements that may appear and the connections between them. This shows evidence of how the visual features learnt by the FCC task support the parsing of complex scientific diagrams.\nWe also estimated a notion of semantic specificity based on the concepts of a KG. For each visual feature, we aggregated the captions of the figures that most activate it and used Cogito to disambiguate the Sensigrafo concepts that appear in them. Then, we estimated how important each concept is to each feature by calculating its tf-idf. Finally, we averaged the resulting values to obtain a consolidated semantic specificity score per feature.\nThe scores of the features in figure FIGREF27 range between 0.42 and 0.65, which is consistently higher than average (0.4). This seems to indicate a correlation between activation and the semantic specificity of each visual feature. For example, the heatmaps of the figures related to the feature with the lowest tf-idf (left-most column) highlights a particular visual pattern, i.e. the whiskers, that may spread over many, possibly unrelated domains. On the other hand, the feature with the highest score (second column) focuses on a type of diagrams, western blots, almost exclusive of protein and genetic studies. Others, like the feature illustrated by the figures in the fifth column, capture the semantics of a specific type of 2D charts relating two magnitudes x and y. Analyzing their captions with Cogito, we see that concepts like e.g. isochronal and exponential functions are mentioned. If we look at the second and four top-most figures in the column, we can see that such concepts are also visually depicted in the figures, suggesting that the FCC task has learnt to recognize them both from the text and visually.\nText features. Similar to the visual case, we selected the features from the last block of the language subnetwork with the highest activation. For visualization purposes, we picked the figures corresponding to the captions in SciGraph that most activate such features (figure FIGREF28). No visual information is used.\nSeveral distinct patterns emerge from the text. The text feature in the first column seems to focus on genetics and histochemistry, including terms like western blots or immunostaining and variations like immunoblot-s/ted/ting. Interestingly, it also seems to have learnt some type of is-a relations (western blot is a type of immunoblot). The second feature focuses on variations of the term radiograph, e.g. radiograph-y/s. The third feature specializes in text related to curve plots involving several statistic analysis, e.g. Real-time PCR, one-way ANOVA or Gaussian distribution. Sometimes (fourth figure from top) the caption does not mention the plot directly, but focuses on the analysis instead, e.g. \"the data presented here are mean values of duplicate experiments\", indicating transfer of knowledge from the visual part during training. The fourth feature extracts citations and models named after prominent scientists, e.g. Evans function (first and fourth figure), Manley (1992) (second), and Aliev-Panfilov model (third). The fifth feature extracts chromatography terminology, e.g. 3D surface plot, photomicrograph or color map and, finally, the right-most feature focuses on different types of named diagrams, like flow charts and state diagrams, e.g. phylogenetic trees.\nAll the captions show a strong semantic correspondence with their associated figures. Figure FIGREF29 shows the activation heatmaps for two sample captions, calculated on the embeddings layer of the language subnetwork. The upper one corresponds to the fourth column left-right and third figure top-down in figure FIGREF28. Its caption reads: \"The Aliev-Panfilov model with $\\alpha =0.01$...The phase portrait depicts trajectories for distinct initial values $\\varphi _0$ and $r_0$...\". Below, (first column, fourth figure in figure FIGREF28): \"Relative protein levels of ubiquitin-protein conjugates in M. quadriceps...A representative immunoblot specific to ubiquitin...\". Consistently with our analysis, activation focuses on the most relevant tokens for each text feature: \"Aliev-Panfilov model\" and \"immunoblot\", respectively.\nThere is a wealth of knowledge in scientific literature and only a fraction of it is text. However, understanding scientific figures is a challenging task for machines, which is beyond their ability to process natural images. In this paper, we provide empirical evidence of this and show that co-training text and visual features from a large corpus of scientific figures and their captions in a correspondence task (FCC) is an effective, flexible and elegant unsupervised means towards overcoming such complexity. We show how such features can be significantly improved by enriching them with additional knowledge sources and, particularly, structured KGs. We prove the benefits of our approach against supervised baselines and in different transfer learning tasks, including text and visual classification and multi-modal machine comprehension applied to question answering, with results generally beyond the state of the art. In the future, it will be interesting to further the study of the interplay between the semantic concepts explicitly represented in different KGs, contextualized embeddings e.g. from SciBERT BIBREF31, and the text and visual features learnt in the FCC task. We also plan to continue to charter the knowledge captured in such features and to pursue the optimization and practical application of our approach.\nThe research reported in this paper is supported by the EU Horizon 2020 programme, under grants European Language Grid-825627 and Co-inform-770302.", "question": "What supervised baselines did they compare with?", "expected_output": "direct combination.

{"id": "1909.09070", "prompt": "Scientific knowledge is heterogeneous and can present itself in many forms, including text, mathematical equations, figures and tables. Like many other manifestations of human thought, the scientific discourse usually adopts the form of a narrative, a scientific publication where related knowledge is presented in mutually supportive ways over different modalities. In the case of scientific figures, like charts, images and diagrams, these are usually accompanied by a text paragraph, a caption, that elaborates on the analysis otherwise visually represented.\nIn this paper, we make use of this observation and tap on the potential of learning from the enormous source of free supervision available in the scientific literature, with millions of figures and their captions. We build models that learn from the scientific discourse both visually and textually by simply looking at the figures and reading their explanatory captions, inspired in how humans learn by reading a scientific publication. To this purpose, we explore how multi-modal scientific knowledge can be learnt from the correspondence between figures and captions.\nThe main contributions of this paper are the following:\nAn unsupervised Figure-Caption Correspondence task (FCC) that jointly learns text and visual features useful to address a range of tasks involving scientific text and figures.\nA method to enrich such features with semantic knowledge transferred from structured knowledge graphs (KG).\nA study of the complexity of figure-caption correspondence compared to classical image-sentence matching.\nA qualitative and quantitative analysis of the learnt text and visual features through transfer learning tasks.\nA corpus of scientific figures and captions extracted from SN SciGraph and AI2 Semantic Scholar.\nWe present the FCC task in section SECREF3, including the network architecture, training protocol, and how adding pre-trained word and semantic embeddings can enrich the resulting text and visual features. In section SECREF4, we first introduce our datasets and evaluate the performance of our method in the task it was trained to solve, the correspondence between scientific figures and captions. Then, we relate our work to the state of the art in image-sentence matching and evaluate our approach in two challenging transfer learning tasks: caption and figure classification and multi-modal machine comprehension. In section SECREF5 we perform a qualitative study that illustrates how the FCC task leads to detailed textual and visual discrimination. Finally, in section SECREF6 we conclude the paper and advance future work.\nUnderstanding natural images has been a major area of research in computer vision, with well established datasets like ImageNet BIBREF0, Flickr8K BIBREF1, Flickr30K BIBREF2 and COCO BIBREF3. However, reasoning with other visual representations like scientific figures and diagrams has not received the same attention yet and entails additional challenges: Scientific figures are more abstract and symbolic, their captions tend to be significantly longer and use specialized lexicon, and the relation between a scientific figure and its caption is unique, i.e. in a scientific publication there is only one caption that corresponds with one figure and vice versa.\nThe FCC task presented herein is a form of co-training BIBREF4 where there are two views of the data and each view provides complementary information. Similar two-branch neural architectures focus on image-sentence BIBREF5, BIBREF6 and audio-video BIBREF7 matching. Others like BIBREF8 learn common embeddings from images and text. However, in such cases one or both networks are typically pre-trained.\nFocused on geometry, BIBREF9 maximize the agreement between text and visual data. In BIBREF10, the authors apply machine vision and natural language processing to extract data from figures and their associated text in bio-curation tasks. In BIBREF11, they parse diagram components and connectors as a Diagram Parse Graph (DPG), semantically interpret the DPG and use the model to answer diagram questions. While we rely on the correspondence between figures and captions, they train a specific classifier for each component and connector type and yet another model to ground the semantics of the DPG in each domain, like food webs or water cycles.\nKnowledge fusion approaches like BIBREF12 investigate the potential of complementing KG embeddings with text and natural images by integrating information across the three modalities in a single latent representation. They assume pre-trained entity representations exist in each individual modality, e.g. the visual features encoding the image of a ball, the word embeddings associated to the token \"ball\", and the KG embeddings related to the ball entity, which are then stitched together. In contrast, FCC co-trains text and visual features from figures and their captions and supports the enrichment of such features with lexical and semantic knowledge transferred from a KG during the training of the FCC task.\nThe main idea of our approach is to learn a correspondence task between scientific figures and their captions as they appear in a scientific publication. The information captured in the caption explains the corresponding figure in natural language, providing guidance to identify the key features of the figure and vice versa. By seeing a figure and reading the textual description in its caption we ultimately aim to learn representations that capture e.g. what it means that two plots are similar or what gravity looks like.\nWe leverage this observation to learn a figure-caption correspondence task. In essence, FCC is a binary classification task that receives a figure and a caption and determines whether they correspond or not. For training, the positive pairs are actual figures and their captions from a collection of scientific publications. Negative pairs are extracted from combinations of figures and any other randomly selected captions. The network is then made to learn text and visual features from scratch, without additional labelled data.\nWe propose a 2-branch neural architecture (figure FIGREF7) that has three main parts: the vision and language subnetworks, respectively extracting visual and text features, and a fusion subnetwork that takes the resulting features from the visual and text blocks and uses them to evaluate figure-caption correspondence.\nThe vision subnetwork follows a VGG-style BIBREF13 design, with 3x3 convolutional filters, 2x2 max-pooling layers with stride 2 and no padding. It contains 4 blocks of conv+conv+pool layers, where inside each block the two convolutional layers have the same number of filters, while consecutive blocks have doubling number of filters (64, 128, 256, 512). The input layer receives 224x224x3 images. The final layer produces a 512-D vector after 28x28 max-pooling. Each convolutional layer is followed by batch normalization BIBREF14 and ReLU layers. Based on BIBREF15, the language subnetwork has 3 convolutional blocks, each with 512 filters and a 5-element window size with ReLU activation. Each convolutional layer is followed by a 5-max pooling layer, except for the final layer, which produces a 512-D vector after 35-max pooling. The language subnetwork has a 300-D embeddings layer at the input, with a maximum sequence length of 1,000 tokens. The fusion subnetwork calculates the element-wise product of the 512-D visual and text feature vectors into a single vector $r$ to produce a 2-way classification output (correspond or not). It has two fully connected layers, with ReLU and an intermediate feature size of 128-D. The probability of each choice is the softmax of $r$, i.e. $\\hat{y} = softmax(r) \\in \\mathbb {R}^{2}$. During training, we minimize the negative log probability of the correct choice.\nThis architecture enables the FCC task to learn visual and text features from scratch in a completely unsupervised manner, just by observing the correspondence of figures and captions. Next, we extend it to enable the transfer of additional pre-trained information. Here, we focus on adding pre-trained embeddings on the language branch, and then back-propagate to the visual features during FCC training. Adding pre-trained visual features is also possible and indeed we also evaluate its impact in the FCC task in section SECREF14.\nLet $V$ be a vocabulary of words from a collection of documents $D$. Also, let $L$ be their lemmas, i.e. base forms without morphological or conjugational variations, and $C$ the concepts (or senses) in a KG. Each word $w_k$ in $V$, e.g. made, has one lemma $l_k$ (make) and may be linked to one or more concepts $c_k$ in $C$ (create or produce something).\nFor each word $w_k$, the FCC task learns a d-D embedding $\\vec{w}_k$, which can be combined with pre-trained word ($\\vec{w^{\\prime }}_k$), lemma ($\\vec{l}_k$) and concept ($\\vec{c}_k$) embeddings to produce a single vector $\\vec{t}_k$. If no pre-trained knowledge is transferred from an external source, then $\\vec{t}_k=\\vec{w}_k$. Note that we previously lemmatize and disambiguate $D$ against the KG in order to select the right pre-trained lemma and concept embeddings for each particular occurrence of $w_k$. Equation DISPLAY_FORM8 shows the different combinations of learnt and pre-trained embeddings we consider: (a) learnt word embeddings only, (b) learnt and pre-trained word embeddings and (c) learnt word embeddings and pre-trained semantic embeddings, including both lemmas and concepts, in line with our recent findings presented in BIBREF16.\nIn our experiments, concatenation proved optimal to combine the embeddings learnt by the network and the pre-trained embeddings, compared to other methods like summation, multiplication, average or learning a task-specific weighting of the different representations as in BIBREF17. Since some words may not have associated pre-trained word, lemma or concept embeddings, we pad these sequences with $\\varnothing _W$, $\\varnothing _L$ and $\\varnothing _C$, which are never included in the vocabulary. The dimensionality of $\\vec{t}_k$ is fixed to 300, i.e. the size of each sub-vector in configurations $(a)$, $(b)$ and $(c)$ is 300, 150 and 100, respectively. In doing so, we aimed at limiting the number of trainable parameters and balance the contribution of each information source.\nIn its most basic form, i.e. configuration $(a)$, the FCC network has over 32M trainable parameters (28M in the language subnetwork, 4M in the vision subnetwork and 135K in the fusion subnetwork) and takes 12 hours to train on a single GPU Nvidia GeForce RTX 2080 Ti for a relatively small corpus (SN SciGraph, see section SECREF12). We used 10-fold cross validation, Adam optimization BIBREF18 with learning rate $10^{-4}$ and weight decay $10^{-5}$. The network was implemented in Keras and TensorFlow, with batch size 32. The number of positive and negative cases is balanced within the batches.\nWe use HolE BIBREF19 and Vecsigrafo BIBREF16 to learn semantic embeddings. The latter extends the Swivel algorithm BIBREF20 to jointly learn word, lemma and concept embeddings on a corpus disambiguated against the KG, outperforming the previous state of the art in word and word-sense embeddings by co-training word, lemma and concept embeddings as opposed to training each individually. In contrast to Vecsigrafo, which requires both a text corpus and a KG, HolE follows a graph-based approach where embeddings are learnt exclusively from the KG. As section SECREF14 will show, this gives Vecsigrafo a certain advantage in the FCC task. Following up with the work presented in BIBREF16, our experiments focus on Sensigrafo, the KG underlying Expert System's Cogito NLP proprietary platform. Similar to WordNet, on which Vecsigrafo has also been successfully trained, Sensigrafo is a general-purpose KG with lexical and semantic information that contains over 300K concepts, 400K lemmas and 80 types of relations rendering 3M links. We use Cogito to disambiguate the text corpora prior to training Vecsigrafo. All the semantic (lemma and concept) embeddings produced with HolE or Vecsigrafo are 100-D.\nIn this section, first we evaluate the actual FCC task against two supervised baselines. Then, we situate our work in the more general image-sentence matching problem, showing empirical evidence of the additional complexity associated to the scientific domain and the figure-caption case compared to natural images. Next, we test the visual and text features learnt in the FCC task in two different transfer learning settings: classification of scientific figures and captions and multi-modal machine comprehension for question answering given a context of text, figures and images.\nWe have used the following datasets for training and evaluation:\nThe Semantic Scholar corpus BIBREF21 (SemScholar) is a large dataset of scientific publications made available by AI2. From its 39M articles, we downloaded 3,3M PDFs (the rest were behind paywalls, did not have a link or it was broken) and extracted 12.5M figures and captions through PDFFigures2 BIBREF22. We randomly selected 500K papers to train the FCC task on their figures and captions and another 500K to train Vecsigrafo on the text of their titles and abstracts.\nSpringer Nature's SciGraph contains 7M scientific publications organized in 22 scientific fields or categories. Since SciGraph does not provide a link to the PDF of the publication, we selected the intersection with SemScholar, producing a smaller corpus of 80K papers (in addition to the 1M papers from SemScholar mentioned above) and 82K figures that we used for training certain FCC configurations and supervised baselines (section SECREF14).\nThe Textbook Question Answering corpus BIBREF23 includes 1,076 lessons and 26,260 multi-modal test questions from middle school science curricula. Its complexity and scope make it a challenging textual and visual question answering dataset.\nWikipedia. We used the January 2018 English Wikipedia dataset as one of the corpora on which to train Vecsigrafo. As opposed to SciGraph or SemScholar, specific of the scientific domain, Wikipedia is a source of general-purpose information.\nFlickr30K and COCO, as image-sentence matching benchmarks.\nWe evaluate our method in the task it was trained to solve: determining whether a figure and a caption correspond. We also compare the performance of the FCC task against two supervised baselines, training them on a classification task against the SciGraph taxonomy. For such baselines we first train the vision and language networks independently and then combine them. The feature extraction parts of both networks are the same as described in section SECREF6. On top of them, we attach a fully connected layer with 128 neurons and ReLU activation and a softmax layer, with as many neurons as target classes.\nThe direct combination baseline computes the figure-caption correspondence through the scalar product between the softmax outputs of both networks. If it exceeds a threshold, which we heuristically fixed on 0.325, the result is positive. The supervised pre-training baseline freezes the weights of the feature extraction trunks from the two trained networks, assembles them in the FCC architecture as shown in section SECREF6, and trains the FCC task on the fully connected layers. While direct combination provides a notion of the agreement between the two branches, supervised pre-training is the most similar supervised approach to our method.\nTable TABREF15 shows the results of the FCC task and the supervised baselines. $FCC_k$ denotes the corpus and word representation used to train the FCC task. Acc$_{vgg}$ shows the accuracy after replacing our visual branch with pre-trained VGG16 features learnt on ImageNet. This provides an estimate of how specific of the scientific domain scientific figures and therefore the resulting visual features can be, compared to natural images. As the table shows, the results obtained using pre-trained visual features are clearly worse in general (only slightly better in $FCC_3$), suggesting that the visual information contained in scientific figures indeed differs from natural images.\nWe trained the FCC network on two different scientific corpora: SciGraph ($FCC_{1-5}$) and SemScholar ($FCC_{6-7}$). Both $FCC_1$ and $FCC_6$ learnt their own word representations without transfer of any pre-trained knowledge. Even in its most basic form our approach substantially improves over the supervised baselines, confirming that the visual and language branches learn from each other and also that figure-caption correspondence is an effective source of free supervision.\nAdding pre-trained knowledge at the input layer of the language subnetwork provides an additional boost, particularly with lemma and concept embeddings from Vecsigrafo ($FCC_5$). Vecsigrafo clearly outperformed HolE ($FCC_3$), which was also beaten by pre-trained fastText BIBREF24 word embeddings ($FCC_2$) trained on SemScholar.\nSince graph-based KG embedding approaches like HolE only generate embeddings of the artifacts explicitly contained in the KG, this may indicate that Sensigrafo, the KG used in this task, provides a partial coverage of the scientific domain, as could be expected since we are using an off-the-shelf version. Deeper inspection shows that HolE only covers 20% of the lemmas in the SciGraph vocabulary. On the other hand, Vecsigrafo, trained on the same KG, also captures lexical information from the text corpora it is trained on, Wikipedia or SemScholar, raising lemma coverage to 42% and 47%, respectively.\nAlthough the size of Wikipedia is almost triple of our SemScholar corpus, training Vecsigrafo on the latter resulted in better FCC accuracy ($FCC_4$ vs. $FCC_5$), suggesting that domain relevance is more significant than sheer volume, in line with our previous findings in BIBREF25. Training FCC on SemScholar, much larger than SciGraph, further improves accuracy, as shown in $FCC_6$ and $FCC_7$.\nWe put our FCC task in the context of the more general problem of image-sentence matching through a bidirectional retrieval task where images are sought given a text query and vice versa. While table TABREF20 focuses on natural images datasets (Flickr30K and COCO), table TABREF21 shows results on scientific datasets (SciGraph and SemScholar) rich in scientific figures and diagrams. The selected baselines (Embedding network, 2WayNet, VSE++ and DSVE-loc) report results obtained on the Flickr30K and COCO datasets, which we also include in table TABREF20. Performance is measured in recall at k ($Rk$), with k={1,5,10}. From the baselines, we successfully reproduced DSVE-loc, using the code made available by the authors, and trained it on SciGraph and SemScholar.\nWe trained the FCC task on all the datasets, both in a totally unsupervised way and with pre-trained semantic embeddings (indicated with subscript $vec$), and executed the bidirectional retrieval task using the resulting text and visual features. We also experimented with pre-trained VGG16 visual features extracted from ImageNet (subscript $vgg$), with more than 14 million hand-annotated images. Following common practice in image-sentence matching, our splits are 1,000 samples for test and the rest for training.\nWe can see a marked division between the results obtained on natural images datasets (table TABREF20) and those focused on scientific figures (table TABREF21). In the former case, VSE++ and DSVE-loc clearly beat all the other approaches. In contrast, our model performs poorly on such datasets although results are ameliorated when we use pre-trained visual features from ImageNet (\"Oursvgg\" and \"Oursvgg-vec\"). Interestingly, the situation reverts with the scientific datasets. While the recall of DSVE-loc drops dramatically in SciGraph, and even more in SemScholar, our approach shows the opposite behavior in both figure and caption retrieval. Using visual features enriched with pre-trained semantic embeddings from Vecsigrafo during training of the FCC task further improves recall in the bidirectional retrieval task. Compared to natural images, the additional complexity of scientific figures and their caption texts, which in addition are considerably longer (see table TABREF19), seems to have a clear impact in this regard.\nUnlike in Flickr30K and COCO, replacing the FCC visual features with pre-trained ones from ImageNet brings us little benefit in SciGraph and even less in SemScholar, where the combination of FCC and Vecsigrafo (\"Oursvec\") obtains the best results across the board. This and the extremely poor performance of the best image-sentence matching baseline (DSVE-loc) in the scientific datasets shows evidence that dealing with scientific figures is considerably more complex than natural images. Indeed, the best results in figure-caption correspondence (\"Oursvec\" in SemScholar) are still far from the SoA in image-sentence matching (DSVE-loc in COCO).\nWe evaluate the language and visual representations emerging from FCC in the context of two classification tasks that aim to identify the scientific field an arbitrary text fragment (a caption) or a figure belong to, according to the SciGraph taxonomy. The latter is a particularly hard task due to the whimsical nature of the figures that appear in our corpus: figure and diagram layout is arbitrary; charts, e.g. bar and pie charts, are used to showcase data in any field from health to engineering; figures and natural images appear indistinctly, etc. Also, note that we only rely on the actual figure, not the text fragment where it is mentioned in the paper.\nWe pick the text and visual features that produced the best FCC results with and without pre-trained semantic embeddings (table TABREF15, $FCC_7$ and $FCC_6$, respectively) and use the language and vision subnetworks presented in section SECREF6 to train our classifiers on SciGraph in two different scenarios. First, we only fine tune the fully connected and softmax layers, freezing the text and visual weights (non-trainable in the table). Second, we fine tune all the parameters in both networks (trainable). In both cases, we compare against a baseline using the same networks initialized with random weights, without FCC training. In doing so, through the first, non-trainable scenario, we seek to quantify the information contributed by the FCC features, while training from scratch on the target corpus should provide an upper bound for figure and caption classification. Additionally, for figure classification, we select a baseline of frozen VGG16 weights trained on ImageNet. We train using 10-fold cross validation and Adam. For the caption classification task, we select learning rate $10^{-3}$ and batch size 128. In figure classification, we use learning rate $10^{-4}$, weight decay $10^{-5}$ and batch size 32.\nThe results in table TABREF23 show that our approach amply beats the baselines, including the upper bound (training from scratch on SciGraph). The delta is particularly noticeable in the non trainable case for both caption and figure classification and is considerably increased in \"Ours $FCC_7$\", which uses pre-trained semantic embeddings. This includes both the random and VGG baselines and illustrates again the additional complexity of analyzing scientific figures compared to natural images, even if the latter is trained on a considerably larger corpus like ImageNet. Fine tuning the whole networks on SciGraph further improves accuracies. In this case, \"Ours $FCC_6$\", which uses FCC features without additional pre-trained embeddings, slightly outperforms \"Ours $FCC_7$\", suggesting a larger margin to learn from the task-specific corpus. Note that both $FCC_6$ and $FCC_7$ were trained on SemScholar.\nWe leverage the TQA dataset and the baselines in BIBREF23 to evaluate the features learnt by the FCC task in a multi-modal machine comprehension scenario. We study how our model, which was not originally trained for this task, performs against state of the art models specifically trained for diagram question answering and textual reading comprehension in a very challenging dataset. We also study how pre-trained semantic embeddings impact in the TQA task: first, by enriching the visual features learnt in the FCC task as shown in section SECREF6 and then by using pre-trained semantic embeddings to enrich word representations in the TQA corpus.\nWe focus on multiple-choice questions, 73% of the dataset. Table TABREF24 shows the performance of our model against the results reported in BIBREF23 for five TQA baselines: random, BiDAF (focused on text machine comprehension), text only ($TQA_1$, based on MemoryNet), text+image ($TQA_2$, VQA), and text+diagrams ($TQA_3$, DSDP-NET). We successfully reproduced the $TQA_1$ and $TQA_2$ architectures and adapted the latter. Then, we replaced the visual features in $TQA_2$ with those learnt by the FCC visual subnetwork both in a completely unsupervised way ($FCC_6$ in table TABREF15) and with pre-trained semantic embeddings ($FCC_7$), resulting in $TQA_4$ and $TQA_5$, respectively.\nWhile $TQA_{1-5}$ used no pre-trained embeddings at all, $TQA_{6-10}$ were trained including pre-trained Vecsigrafo semantic embeddings. Unlike FCC, where we used concatenation to combine pre-trained lemma and concept embeddings with the word embeddings learnt by the task, element-wise addition worked best in the case of TQA.\nFollowing the recommendations in BIBREF23, we pre-processed the TQA corpus to i) consider knowledge from previous lessons in the textbook in addition to the lesson of the question at hand and ii) address challenges like long question contexts with a large lexicon. In both text and diagram MC, applying the Pareto principle to reduce the maximum token sequence length in the text of each question, their answers and context improved accuracy considerably. This optimization allowed reducing the amount of text to consider for each question, improving the signal to noise ratio. Finally, we obtained the most relevant paragraphs for each question through tf-idf and trained the models using 10-fold cross validation, Adam, learning rate $10^{-2}$ and batch size 128. In text MC we also used 0.5 dropout and recurrent dropout in the LSTM layers.\nFitting multi-modal sources into a single memory, the use of visual FCC features clearly outperforms all the TQA baselines in diagram MC. Enhancing word representation with pre-trained semantic embeddings during training of the TQA task provides an additional boost that results in the highest accuracies for both text MC and diagram MC. These are significantly good results since, according to the TQA authors BIBREF23, most diagram questions in the TQA corpus would normally require a specific rich diagram parse, which we did not aim to provide.\nWe inspect the features learnt by our FCC task to gain a deeper understanding of the syntactic and semantic patterns captured for figure and caption representation. The findings reported herein are qualitatively consistent for all the FCC variations in table TABREF15.\nVision features. The analysis was carried out on an unconstrained variety of charts, diagrams and natural images from SciGraph, without filtering by figure type or scientific field. To obtain a representative sample of what the FCC network learns, we focus on the 512-D vector resulting from the last convolutional block before the fusion subnetwork. We pick the features with the most significant activation over the whole dataset and select the figures that activate them most. To this purpose, we prioritize those with higher maximum activation against the average activation.\nFigure FIGREF27 shows a selection of 6 visual features with the 4 figures that activate each feature more significantly and their activation heatmaps. Only figures are used as input, no text. As can be seen, the vision subnetwork has automatically learnt, without explicit supervision, to recognize different types of diagrams, charts and content, such as (from left to right) whisker plots, western blots (a technique used to identify proteins in a tissue sample), multi-image comparison diagrams, multi-modal data visualization charts (e.g. western plots vs. bar charts), line plots, and text within the figures. Furthermore, as shown by the heatmaps, our model discriminates the key elements associated to the figures that most activate each feature: the actual whiskers, the blots, the borders of each image under comparison, the blots and their complementary bar charts, as well as the line plots and the correspondence between them and the values in the x and y axes. Also, see (right-most column) how a feature discriminates text inserted in the figure, regardless of the remaining elements that may appear and the connections between them. This shows evidence of how the visual features learnt by the FCC task support the parsing of complex scientific diagrams.\nWe also estimated a notion of semantic specificity based on the concepts of a KG. For each visual feature, we aggregated the captions of the figures that most activate it and used Cogito to disambiguate the Sensigrafo concepts that appear in them. Then, we estimated how important each concept is to each feature by calculating its tf-idf. Finally, we averaged the resulting values to obtain a consolidated semantic specificity score per feature.\nThe scores of the features in figure FIGREF27 range between 0.42 and 0.65, which is consistently higher than average (0.4). This seems to indicate a correlation between activation and the semantic specificity of each visual feature. For example, the heatmaps of the figures related to the feature with the lowest tf-idf (left-most column) highlights a particular visual pattern, i.e. the whiskers, that may spread over many, possibly unrelated domains. On the other hand, the feature with the highest score (second column) focuses on a type of diagrams, western blots, almost exclusive of protein and genetic studies. Others, like the feature illustrated by the figures in the fifth column, capture the semantics of a specific type of 2D charts relating two magnitudes x and y. Analyzing their captions with Cogito, we see that concepts like e.g. isochronal and exponential functions are mentioned. If we look at the second and four top-most figures in the column, we can see that such concepts are also visually depicted in the figures, suggesting that the FCC task has learnt to recognize them both from the text and visually.\nText features. Similar to the visual case, we selected the features from the last block of the language subnetwork with the highest activation. For visualization purposes, we picked the figures corresponding to the captions in SciGraph that most activate such features (figure FIGREF28). No visual information is used.\nSeveral distinct patterns emerge from the text. The text feature in the first column seems to focus on genetics and histochemistry, including terms like western blots or immunostaining and variations like immunoblot-s/ted/ting. Interestingly, it also seems to have learnt some type of is-a relations (western blot is a type of immunoblot). The second feature focuses on variations of the term radiograph, e.g. radiograph-y/s. The third feature specializes in text related to curve plots involving several statistic analysis, e.g. Real-time PCR, one-way ANOVA or Gaussian distribution. Sometimes (fourth figure from top) the caption does not mention the plot directly, but focuses on the analysis instead, e.g. \"the data presented here are mean values of duplicate experiments\", indicating transfer of knowledge from the visual part during training. The fourth feature extracts citations and models named after prominent scientists, e.g. Evans function (first and fourth figure), Manley (1992) (second), and Aliev-Panfilov model (third). The fifth feature extracts chromatography terminology, e.g. 3D surface plot, photomicrograph or color map and, finally, the right-most feature focuses on different types of named diagrams, like flow charts and state diagrams, e.g. phylogenetic trees.\nAll the captions show a strong semantic correspondence with their associated figures. Figure FIGREF29 shows the activation heatmaps for two sample captions, calculated on the embeddings layer of the language subnetwork. The upper one corresponds to the fourth column left-right and third figure top-down in figure FIGREF28. Its caption reads: \"The Aliev-Panfilov model with $\\alpha =0.01$...The phase portrait depicts trajectories for distinct initial values $\\varphi _0$ and $r_0$...\". Below, (first column, fourth figure in figure FIGREF28): \"Relative protein levels of ubiquitin-protein conjugates in M. quadriceps...A representative immunoblot specific to ubiquitin...\". Consistently with our analysis, activation focuses on the most relevant tokens for each text feature: \"Aliev-Panfilov model\" and \"immunoblot\", respectively.\nThere is a wealth of knowledge in scientific literature and only a fraction of it is text. However, understanding scientific figures is a challenging task for machines, which is beyond their ability to process natural images. In this paper, we provide empirical evidence of this and show that co-training text and visual features from a large corpus of scientific figures and their captions in a correspondence task (FCC) is an effective, flexible and elegant unsupervised means towards overcoming such complexity. We show how such features can be significantly improved by enriching them with additional knowledge sources and, particularly, structured KGs. We prove the benefits of our approach against supervised baselines and in different transfer learning tasks, including text and visual classification and multi-modal machine comprehension applied to question answering, with results generally beyond the state of the art. In the future, it will be interesting to further the study of the interplay between the semantic concepts explicitly represented in different KGs, contextualized embeddings e.g. from SciBERT BIBREF31, and the text and visual features learnt in the FCC task. We also plan to continue to charter the knowledge captured in such features and to pursue the optimization and practical application of our approach.\nThe research reported in this paper is supported by the EU Horizon 2020 programme, under grants European Language Grid-825627 and Co-inform-770302.", "question": "Where do their figure and captions come from?", "expected_output": "The Semantic Scholar corpus.

{"id": "1708.05521", "prompt": "Twitter is a huge micro-blogging service with more than 500 million tweets per day from different locations in the world and in different languages. This large, continuous, and dynamically updated content is considered a valuable resource for researchers. In particular, many of these messages contain emotional charge, conveying affect\u2014emotions, feelings and attitudes, which can be studied to understand the expression of emotion in text, as well as the social phenomena associated.\nWhile studying emotion in text it is commonly useful to characterize the emotional charge of a passage based on its words. Some words have affect as a core part of their meaning. For example, dejected and wistful denote some amount of sadness, and are thus associated with sadness. On the other hand, some words are associated with affect even though they do not denote affect. For example, failure and death describe concepts that are usually accompanied by sadness and thus they denote some amount of sadness.\nWhile analyzing the emotional content in text, mosts tasks are almost always framed as classification tasks, where the intention is to identify one emotion among many for a sentence or passage. However, it is often useful for applications to know the degree to which an emotion is expressed in text. To this end, the WASSA-2017 Shared Task on Emotion Intensity BIBREF0 represents the first task where systems have to automatically determine the intensity of emotions in tweets. Concretely, the objective is to given a tweet containing the emotion of joy, sadness, fear or anger, determine the intensity or degree of the emotion felt by the speaker as a real-valued score between zero and one.\nThe task is specially challenging since tweets contain informal language, spelling errors and text referring to external content. Given the 140 character limit of tweets, it is also possible to find some phenomena such as the intensive usage of emoticons and of other special Twitter features, such as hashtags and usernames mentions \u2014used to call or notify other users. In this paper we describe our system designed for the WASSA-2017 Shared Task on Emotion Intensity, which we tackle based on the premise of representation learning without the usage of external information, such as lexicons. In particular, we use a Bi-LSTM model with intra-sentence attention on top of word embeddings to generate a tweet representation that is suitable for emotion intensity. Our results show that our proposed model offers interesting capabilities compared to approaches that do rely on external information sources.\nOur work is related to deep learning techniques for emotion recognition in images BIBREF1 and videos BIBREF2 , as well as and emotion classification BIBREF3 . Our work is also related to liuattention-based2016, who introduced an attention RNN for slot filling in Natural Language Understanding. Since in the task the input-output alignment is explicit, they investigated how the alignment can be best utilized in encoder-decoder models concluding that the attention mechanisms are helpful.\nEmoAtt is based on a bidirectional RNN that receives an embedded input sequence INLINEFORM0 and returns a list of hidden vectors that capture the context each input token INLINEFORM1 . To improve the capabilities of the RNN to capture short-term temporal dependencies BIBREF4 , we define the following: DISPLAYFORM0 \nWhere INLINEFORM0 can be regarded as a context window of ordered word embedding vectors around position INLINEFORM1 , with a total size of INLINEFORM2 . To further complement the context-aware token representations, we concatenate each hidden vector to a vector of binary features INLINEFORM3 , extracted from each tweet token, defining an augmented hidden state INLINEFORM4 . Finally, we combine our INLINEFORM5 augmented hidden states, compressing them into a single vector, using a global intra-sentence attentional component in a fashion similar to vinyalsgrammar2015. Formally, DISPLAYFORM0 \nWhere INLINEFORM0 is the vector that compresses the input sentence INLINEFORM1 , focusing on the relevant parts to estimate emotion intensity. We input this compressed sentence representation into a feed-forward neural network, INLINEFORM2 , where INLINEFORM3 is the final predicted emotion intensity. As a loss function we use the mini-batch negative Pearson correlation with the gold-standard.\nTo test our model, we experiment using the training, validation and test datasets provided for the shared task BIBREF5 , which include tweets for four emotions: joy, sadness, fear, and anger. These were annotated using Best-Worst Scaling (BWS) to obtain very reliable scores BIBREF6 .\nWe experimented with GloVe BIBREF7 as pre-trained word embedding vectors, for sizes 25, 50 and 100. These are vectors trained on a dataset of 2B tweets, with a total vocabulary of 1.2 M. To pre-process the data, we used Twokenizer BIBREF8 , which basically provides a set of curated rules to split the tweets into tokens. We also use Tweeboparser BIBREF9 to get the POS-tags for each tweet.\nTable TABREF3 summarizes the average, maximum and minimum sentence lengths for each dataset after we processed them with Twokenizer. We can see the four corpora offer similar characteristics in terms of length, with a cross dataset maximum length of 41 tokens. We also see there is an important vocabulary gap between the dataset and GloVe, with an average coverage of only 64.3 %. To tackle this issue, we used a set of binary features derived from POS tags to capture some of the semantics of the words that are not covered by the GloVe embeddings. We also include features for member mentions and hashtags as well as a feature to capture word elongation, based on regular expressions. Word elongation is very common in tweets, and is usually associated to strong sentiment. The following are the POS tag-derived rules we used to generate our binary features.\nWhile the structure of our introduced model allows us to easily include more linguistic features that could potentially improve our predictive power, such as lexicons, since our focus is to study sentence representation for emotion intensity, we do not experiment adding any additional sources of information as input.\nIn this paper we also only report results for LSTMs, which outperformed regular RNNs as well as GRUs and a batch normalized version of the LSTM in on preliminary experiments. The hidden size of the attentional component is set to match the size of the augmented hidden vectors on each case. Given this setting, we explored different hyper-parameter configurations, including context window sizes of 1, 3 and 5 as well as RNN hidden state sizes of 100, 200 and 300. We experimented with unidirectional and bidirectional versions of the RNNs.\nTo avoid over-fitting, we used dropout regularization, experimenting with keep probabilities of INLINEFORM0 and INLINEFORM1 . We also added a weighed L2 regularization term to our loss function. We experimented with different values for weight INLINEFORM2 , with a minimum value of 0.01 and a maximum of 0.2.\nTo evaluate our model, we wrapped the provided scripts for the shared task and calculated the Pearson correlation coefficient and the Spearman rank coefficient with the gold standard in the validation set, as well as the same values over a subset of the same data formed by taking every instance with a gold emotion intensity score greater than or equal to 0.5.\nFor training, we used mini-batch stochastic gradient descent with a batch size of 16 and padded sequences to a maximum size of 50 tokens, given the nature of the data. We used exponential decay of ratio INLINEFORM0 and early stopping on the validation when there was no improvement after 1000 steps. Our code is available for download on GitHub .\nIn this section we report the results of the experiments we performed to test our proposed model. In general, as Table TABREF13 shows, our intra-sentence attention RNN was able to outperform the Weka baseline BIBREF5 on the development dataset by a solid margin. Moreover, the model manages to do so without any additional resources, except pre-trained word embeddings. These results are, however, reversed for the test dataset, where our model performs worse than the baseline. This shows that the model is not able to generalize well, which we think is related to the missing semantic information due to the vocabulary gap we observed between the datasets and the GloVe embeddings.\nTo validate the usefulness of our binary features, we performed an ablation experiment and trained our best models for each corpus without them. Table TABREF15 summarizes our results in terms of Pearson correlation on the development portion of the datasets. As seen, performance decreases in all cases, which shows that indeed these features are critical for performance, allowing the model to better capture the semantics of words missing in GloVe. In this sense, we think the usage of additional features, such as the ones derived from emotion or sentiment lexicons could indeed boost our model capabilities. This is proposed for future work.\nOn the other hand, our model also offers us very interesting insights on how the learning is performed, since we can inspect the attention weights that the neural network is assigning to each specific token when predicting the emotion intensity. By visualizing these weights we can have a clear notion about the parts of the sentence that the model considers are more important. As Figure FIGREF16 shows, we see the model seems to be have learned to attend the words that naturally bear emotion or sentiment. This is specially patent for the examples extracted from the Joy dataset, where positive words are generally identified. However, we also see some examples where the lack of semantic information about the input words, specially for hashtags or user mentions, makes the model unable to identify some of these the most salient words to predict emotion intensity. Several pre-processing techniques can be implemented to alleviate this problem, which we intend to explore in the future.\nFor the anger dataset, our experiments showed that GloVe embeddings of dimension 50 outperformed others, obtaining an average gain of 0.066 correlation over embeddings of size 25 and of 0.021 for embeddings of size 100. However on ly the first of these values was significant, with a p-value of INLINEFORM0 . Regarding the hidden size of the RNN, we could not find statistical difference across the tested sizes. Dropout also had inconsistent effects, but was generally useful.\nIn the joy dataset, our experiments showed us that GloVe vectors of dimension 50 again outperformed others, in this case obtaining an average correlation gain of 0.052 ( INLINEFORM0 ) over embeddings of size 100, and of 0.062 ( INLINEFORM1 ) for size 25. Regarding the hidden size of the RNN, we observed that 100 hidden units offered better performance in our experiments, with an average absolute gain of 0.052 ( INLINEFORM2 ) over 50 hidden units. Compared to the models with 200 hidden units, the performance difference was statistically not significant.\nOn the fear dataset, again we observed that embeddings of size 50 provided the best results, offering average gains of 0.12 ( INLINEFORM0 ) and 0.11 ( INLINEFORM1 ) for sizes 25 and 100, respectively. When it comes to the size of the RNN hidden state, our experiments showed that using 100 hidden units offered the best results, with average absolute gains of 0.117 ( INLINEFORM2 ) and 0.108 ( INLINEFORM3 ) over sizes 50 and 200.\nFinally, on the sadness datasets again we experimentally observed that using embeddings of 50 offered the best results, with a statistically significant average gain of 0.092 correlation points INLINEFORM0 over size 25. Results were statistically equivalent for size 100. We also observed that using 50 or 100 hidden units for the RNN offered statistically equivalent results, while both of these offered better performance than when using a hidden size of 200.\nIn this paper we introduced an intra-sentence attention RNN for the of emotion intensity, which we developed for the WASSA-2017 Shared Task on Emotion Intensity.

This is specially patent for the examples extracted from the Joy dataset, where positive words are generally identified. However, we also see some examples where the lack of semantic information about the input words, specially for hashtags or user mentions, makes the model unable to identify some of these the most salient words to predict emotion intensity. Several pre-processing techniques can be implemented to alleviate this problem, which we intend to explore in the future.\nFor the anger dataset, our experiments showed that GloVe embeddings of dimension 50 outperformed others, obtaining an average gain of 0.066 correlation over embeddings of size 25 and of 0.021 for embeddings of size 100. However on ly the first of these values was significant, with a p-value of INLINEFORM0 . Regarding the hidden size of the RNN, we could not find statistical difference across the tested sizes. Dropout also had inconsistent effects, but was generally useful.\nIn the joy dataset, our experiments showed us that GloVe vectors of dimension 50 again outperformed others, in this case obtaining an average correlation gain of 0.052 ( INLINEFORM0 ) over embeddings of size 100, and of 0.062 ( INLINEFORM1 ) for size 25. Regarding the hidden size of the RNN, we observed that 100 hidden units offered better performance in our experiments, with an average absolute gain of 0.052 ( INLINEFORM2 ) over 50 hidden units. Compared to the models with 200 hidden units, the performance difference was statistically not significant.\nOn the fear dataset, again we observed that embeddings of size 50 provided the best results, offering average gains of 0.12 ( INLINEFORM0 ) and 0.11 ( INLINEFORM1 ) for sizes 25 and 100, respectively. When it comes to the size of the RNN hidden state, our experiments showed that using 100 hidden units offered the best results, with average absolute gains of 0.117 ( INLINEFORM2 ) and 0.108 ( INLINEFORM3 ) over sizes 50 and 200.\nFinally, on the sadness datasets again we experimentally observed that using embeddings of 50 offered the best results, with a statistically significant average gain of 0.092 correlation points INLINEFORM0 over size 25. Results were statistically equivalent for size 100. We also observed that using 50 or 100 hidden units for the RNN offered statistically equivalent results, while both of these offered better performance than when using a hidden size of 200.\nIn this paper we introduced an intra-sentence attention RNN for the of emotion intensity, which we developed for the WASSA-2017 Shared Task on Emotion Intensity.

{"id": "1708.05521", "prompt": "Twitter is a huge micro-blogging service with more than 500 million tweets per day from different locations in the world and in different languages. This large, continuous, and dynamically updated content is considered a valuable resource for researchers. In particular, many of these messages contain emotional charge, conveying affect\u2014emotions, feelings and attitudes, which can be studied to understand the expression of emotion in text, as well as the social phenomena associated.\nWhile studying emotion in text it is commonly useful to characterize the emotional charge of a passage based on its words. Some words have affect as a core part of their meaning. For example, dejected and wistful denote some amount of sadness, and are thus associated with sadness. On the other hand, some words are associated with affect even though they do not denote affect. For example, failure and death describe concepts that are usually accompanied by sadness and thus they denote some amount of sadness.\nWhile analyzing the emotional content in text, mosts tasks are almost always framed as classification tasks, where the intention is to identify one emotion among many for a sentence or passage. However, it is often useful for applications to know the degree to which an emotion is expressed in text. To this end, the WASSA-2017 Shared Task on Emotion Intensity BIBREF0 represents the first task where systems have to automatically determine the intensity of emotions in tweets. Concretely, the objective is to given a tweet containing the emotion of joy, sadness, fear or anger, determine the intensity or degree of the emotion felt by the speaker as a real-valued score between zero and one.\nThe task is specially challenging since tweets contain informal language, spelling errors and text referring to external content. Given the 140 character limit of tweets, it is also possible to find some phenomena such as the intensive usage of emoticons and of other special Twitter features, such as hashtags and usernames mentions \u2014used to call or notify other users. In this paper we describe our system designed for the WASSA-2017 Shared Task on Emotion Intensity, which we tackle based on the premise of representation learning without the usage of external information, such as lexicons. In particular, we use a Bi-LSTM model with intra-sentence attention on top of word embeddings to generate a tweet representation that is suitable for emotion intensity. Our results show that our proposed model offers interesting capabilities compared to approaches that do rely on external information sources.\nOur work is related to deep learning techniques for emotion recognition in images BIBREF1 and videos BIBREF2 , as well as and emotion classification BIBREF3 . Our work is also related to liuattention-based2016, who introduced an attention RNN for slot filling in Natural Language Understanding. Since in the task the input-output alignment is explicit, they investigated how the alignment can be best utilized in encoder-decoder models concluding that the attention mechanisms are helpful.\nEmoAtt is based on a bidirectional RNN that receives an embedded input sequence INLINEFORM0 and returns a list of hidden vectors that capture the context each input token INLINEFORM1 . To improve the capabilities of the RNN to capture short-term temporal dependencies BIBREF4 , we define the following: DISPLAYFORM0 \nWhere INLINEFORM0 can be regarded as a context window of ordered word embedding vectors around position INLINEFORM1 , with a total size of INLINEFORM2 . To further complement the context-aware token representations, we concatenate each hidden vector to a vector of binary features INLINEFORM3 , extracted from each tweet token, defining an augmented hidden state INLINEFORM4 . Finally, we combine our INLINEFORM5 augmented hidden states, compressing them into a single vector, using a global intra-sentence attentional component in a fashion similar to vinyalsgrammar2015. Formally, DISPLAYFORM0 \nWhere INLINEFORM0 is the vector that compresses the input sentence INLINEFORM1 , focusing on the relevant parts to estimate emotion intensity. We input this compressed sentence representation into a feed-forward neural network, INLINEFORM2 , where INLINEFORM3 is the final predicted emotion intensity. As a loss function we use the mini-batch negative Pearson correlation with the gold-standard.\nTo test our model, we experiment using the training, validation and test datasets provided for the shared task BIBREF5 , which include tweets for four emotions: joy, sadness, fear, and anger. These were annotated using Best-Worst Scaling (BWS) to obtain very reliable scores BIBREF6 .\nWe experimented with GloVe BIBREF7 as pre-trained word embedding vectors, for sizes 25, 50 and 100. These are vectors trained on a dataset of 2B tweets, with a total vocabulary of 1.2 M. To pre-process the data, we used Twokenizer BIBREF8 , which basically provides a set of curated rules to split the tweets into tokens. We also use Tweeboparser BIBREF9 to get the POS-tags for each tweet.\nTable TABREF3 summarizes the average, maximum and minimum sentence lengths for each dataset after we processed them with Twokenizer. We can see the four corpora offer similar characteristics in terms of length, with a cross dataset maximum length of 41 tokens. We also see there is an important vocabulary gap between the dataset and GloVe, with an average coverage of only 64.3 %. To tackle this issue, we used a set of binary features derived from POS tags to capture some of the semantics of the words that are not covered by the GloVe embeddings. We also include features for member mentions and hashtags as well as a feature to capture word elongation, based on regular expressions. Word elongation is very common in tweets, and is usually associated to strong sentiment. The following are the POS tag-derived rules we used to generate our binary features.\nWhile the structure of our introduced model allows us to easily include more linguistic features that could potentially improve our predictive power, such as lexicons, since our focus is to study sentence representation for emotion intensity, we do not experiment adding any additional sources of information as input.\nIn this paper we also only report results for LSTMs, which outperformed regular RNNs as well as GRUs and a batch normalized version of the LSTM in on preliminary experiments. The hidden size of the attentional component is set to match the size of the augmented hidden vectors on each case. Given this setting, we explored different hyper-parameter configurations, including context window sizes of 1, 3 and 5 as well as RNN hidden state sizes of 100, 200 and 300. We experimented with unidirectional and bidirectional versions of the RNNs.\nTo avoid over-fitting, we used dropout regularization, experimenting with keep probabilities of INLINEFORM0 and INLINEFORM1 . We also added a weighed L2 regularization term to our loss function. We experimented with different values for weight INLINEFORM2 , with a minimum value of 0.01 and a maximum of 0.2.\nTo evaluate our model, we wrapped the provided scripts for the shared task and calculated the Pearson correlation coefficient and the Spearman rank coefficient with the gold standard in the validation set, as well as the same values over a subset of the same data formed by taking every instance with a gold emotion intensity score greater than or equal to 0.5.\nFor training, we used mini-batch stochastic gradient descent with a batch size of 16 and padded sequences to a maximum size of 50 tokens, given the nature of the data. We used exponential decay of ratio INLINEFORM0 and early stopping on the validation when there was no improvement after 1000 steps. Our code is available for download on GitHub .\nIn this section we report the results of the experiments we performed to test our proposed model. In general, as Table TABREF13 shows, our intra-sentence attention RNN was able to outperform the Weka baseline BIBREF5 on the development dataset by a solid margin. Moreover, the model manages to do so without any additional resources, except pre-trained word embeddings. These results are, however, reversed for the test dataset, where our model performs worse than the baseline. This shows that the model is not able to generalize well, which we think is related to the missing semantic information due to the vocabulary gap we observed between the datasets and the GloVe embeddings.\nTo validate the usefulness of our binary features, we performed an ablation experiment and trained our best models for each corpus without them. Table TABREF15 summarizes our results in terms of Pearson correlation on the development portion of the datasets. As seen, performance decreases in all cases, which shows that indeed these features are critical for performance, allowing the model to better capture the semantics of words missing in GloVe. In this sense, we think the usage of additional features, such as the ones derived from emotion or sentiment lexicons could indeed boost our model capabilities. This is proposed for future work.\nOn the other hand, our model also offers us very interesting insights on how the learning is performed, since we can inspect the attention weights that the neural network is assigning to each specific token when predicting the emotion intensity. By visualizing these weights we can have a clear notion about the parts of the sentence that the model considers are more important. As Figure FIGREF16 shows, we see the model seems to be have learned to attend the words that naturally bear emotion or sentiment. This is specially patent for the examples extracted from the Joy dataset, where positive words are generally identified.

{"id": "1908.11049", "prompt": "With the expanding amount of text data generated on different social media platforms, current filters are insufficient to prevent the spread of hate speech. Most internet users involved in a study conducted by the Pew Research Center report having been subjected to offensive name calling online or witnessed someone being physically threatened or harassed online. Additionally, Amnesty International within Element AI have lately reported that many women politicians and journalists are assaulted every 30 seconds on Twitter. This is despite the Twitter policy condemning the promotion of violence against people on the basis of race, ethnicity, national origin, sexual orientation, gender identity, religious affiliation, age, disability, or serious disease. Hate speech may not represent the general opinion, yet it promotes the dehumanization of people who are typically from minority groups BIBREF0, BIBREF1 and can incite hate crime BIBREF2.\nMoreover, although people of various linguistic backgrounds are exposed to hate speech BIBREF3, BIBREF2, English is still at the center of existing work on toxic language analysis. Recently, some research studies have been conducted on languages such as German BIBREF4, Arabic BIBREF5, and Italian BIBREF6. However, such studies usually use monolingual corpora and do not contrast, or examine the correlations between online hate speech in different languages. On the other hand, tasks involving more than one language such as the hatEval task, which covers English and Spanish, include only separate classification tasks, namely (a) women and immigrants as target groups, (b) individual or generic hate and, (c) aggressive or non-aggressive hate speech.\nTreating hate speech classification as a binary task may not be enough to inspect the motivation and the behavior of the users promoting it and, how people would react to it. For instance, the hateful tweets presented in Figure FIGREF5 show toxicity directed towards different targets, with or without using slurs, and generating several types of reactions. We believe that, in order to balance between truth and subjectivity, there are at least five important aspects in hate speech analysis. Hence, our annotations indicate (a) whether the text is direct or indirect; (b) if it is offensive, disrespectful, hateful, fearful out of ignorance, abusive, or normal; (c) the attribute based on which it discriminates against an individual or a group of people; (d) the name of this group; and (e) how the annotators feel about its content within a range of negative to neutral sentiments. To the best of our knowledge there are no other hate speech datasets that attempt to capture fear out of ignorance in hateful tweets or examine how people react to hate speech. We claim that our multi-aspect annotation schema would provide a valuable insight into several linguistic and cultural differences and bias in hate speech.\nWe use Amazon Mechanical Turk to label around 13,000 potentially derogatory tweets in English, French, and Arabic based on the above mentioned aspects and, regard each aspect as a prediction task. Since in natural language processing, there is a peculiar interest in multitask learning, where different tasks can be used to help each other BIBREF7, BIBREF8, BIBREF9, we use a unified model to handle the annotated data in all three languages and five tasks. We adopt BIBREF8 as a learning algorithm adapted to loosely related tasks such as our five annotated aspects and, use the Babylon cross-lingual embeddings BIBREF10 to align the three languages. We compare the multilingual multitask learning settings with monolingual multitask, multilingual single-task, and monolingual single-task learning settings respectively. Then, we report the performance results of the different settings and discuss how each task affects the remaining ones. We release our dataset and code to the community to extend research work on multilingual hate speech detection and classification.\nThere is little consensus on the difference between profanity and hate speech and, how to define the latter BIBREF17. As shown in Figure FIGREF11, slurs are not an unequivocal indicator of hate speech and can be part of a non-aggressive conversation, while some of the most offensive comments may come in the form of subtle metaphors or sarcasm BIBREF18. Consequently, there is no existing human annotated vocabulary that explicitly reveals the presence of hate speech, which makes the available hate speech corpora sparse and noisy BIBREF19.\nGiven the subjectivity and the complexity of such data, annotation schemes have rarely been made fine-grained. Table TABREF10 compares different labelsets that exist in the literature. For instance, BIBREF12 use racist, sexist, and normal as labels; BIBREF13 label their data as hateful, offensive (but not hateful), and neither, while BIBREF16 present an English dataset that records the target category based on which hate speech discriminates against people, such as ethnicity, gender, or sexual orientation and ask human annotators to classify the tweets as hate and non hate. BIBREF15 label their data as offensive, abusive, hateful, aggressive, cyberbullying, spam, and normal. On the other hand, BIBREF20 have chosen to detect ideologies of hate speech counting 40 different hate ideologies among 13 extremist hate groups.\nThe detection of hate speech targets is yet another challenging aspect of the annotation. BIBREF21 report the bias that exists in the current datasets towards identity words, such as women, which may later cause false predictions. They propose to debias gender identity word embeddings with additional data for training and tuning their binary classifier. We address this false positive bias problem and the common ambiguity of target detection by asking the annotators to label target attributes such as origin, gender, or religious affiliation within 16 named target groups such as refugees, or immigrants.\nFurthermore, BIBREF22 have reproduced the experiment of BIBREF12 in order to study how hate speech affects the popularity of a tweet, but discovered that some tweets have been deleted. For replication purposes, we provide the community with anonymized tweet texts rather than IDs.\nNon-English hate speech datasets include Italian, German, Dutch, and Arabic corpora. BIBREF6 present a dataset of Italian tweets, in which the annotations capture the degree of intensity of offensive and aggressive tweets, in addition to whether the tweets are ironic and contain stereotypes or not. BIBREF2 have collected more than 500 German tweets against refugees, and annotated them as hateful and not hateful. BIBREF23 detect bullies and victims among youngsters in Dutch comments on AskFM, and classify cyberbullying comments as insults or threats. Moreover, BIBREF5 provide a corpus of Arabic sectarian speech.\nAnother predominant phenomenon in hate speech corpora is code switching. BIBREF24 present a dataset of code mixed Hindi-English tweets, while BIBREF25 report the presence of Hindi tokens in English data and use multilingual word embeddings to deal with this issue when detecting toxicity. Similarly, we use such embeddings to take advantage of the multilinguality and comparability of our corpora during the classification.\nOur dataset is the first trilingual dataset comprising English, French, and Arabic tweets that encompasses various targets and hostility types. Additionally, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that examines how annotators react to hate speech comments.\nTo fully exploit the collected annotations, we tested multitask learning on our dataset. Multitask learning BIBREF7 allows neural networks to share parameters with one another and, thus, learn from related tasks. It has been used in different NLP tasks such as parsing BIBREF9, dependency parsing BIBREF26, neural machine translation BIBREF27, sentiment analysis BIBREF28, and other tasks. Multitask learning architectures tackle challenges that include sharing the label space and the question of private and shared space for loosely related tasks BIBREF8, for which techniques may involve a massive space of potential parameter sharing architectures.\nIn this section, we present our data collection methodology and annotation process.\nConsidering the cultural differences and commonly debated topics in the main geographic regions where English, French, and Arabic are spoken, searching for equivalent terms in the three languages led to different results at first. Therefore, after looking for 1,000 tweets per 15 more or less equivalent phrases in the three languages, we revised our search words three times by questioning the results, adding phrases, and taking off unlikely ones in each of the languages. In fact, we started our data collection by searching for common slurs and demeaning expressions such as \u201cgo back to where you come from\u201d. Then, we observed that discussions about controversial topics, such as feminism in general, illegal immigrants in English, Islamo-gauchisme (\u201cIslamic leftism\") in French, or Iran in Arabic were more likely to provoke disputes, comments filled with toxicity and thus, notable insult patterns that we looked for in subsequent search rounds.\nAll of the annotated tweets include original tweets only, whose content has been processed by (1) deleting unarguably detectable spam tweets, (2) removing unreadable characters and emojis, and (3) masking the names of mentioned users using @user and potentially enclosed URLs using @url. As a result, annotators had to face the lack of context generated by this normalization process.\nFurthermore, we perceived code-switching in English where Hindi, Spanish, and French tokens appear in the tweets. Some French tweets also contain Romanized dialectal Arabic tokens generated by, most likely, bilingual North African Twitter users. Hence, although we eliminated most of these tweets in order to avoid misleading the annotators, the possibly remaining ones still added noise to the data.\nOne more challenge that the annotators and ourselves had to tackle, consisted of Arabic diglossia and switching between different Arabic dialects and Modern Standard Arabic (MSA). While MSA represents the standardized and literary variety of Arabic, there are several Arabic dialects spoken in North Africa and the Middle East in use on Twitter. Therefore, we searched for derogatory terms adapted to different circumstances, and acquired an Arabic corpus that combines tweets written in MSA and Arabic dialects. For instance, the tweet shown in Figure FIGREF5 contains a dialectal slur that means \u201cmaiden.\u201d\nWe rely on the general public opinion and common linguistic knowledge to assess how people view and react to hate speech. Given the subjectivity and difficulty of the task, we reminded the annotators not to let their personal opinions about the topics being discussed in the tweets influence their annotation decisions.\nOur annotation guidelines explained the fact that offensive comments and hate do not necessarily come in the form of profanity. Since different degrees of discrimination work on the dehumanization of individuals or groups of people in distinct ways, we chose not to annotate the tweets within two or three classes. For instance, a sexist comment can be disrespectful, hateful, or offensive towards women. Our initial labelset was established in conformity with the prevalent anti-social behaviors people tend to deal with. We also chose to address the problem of false positives caused by the misleading use of identity words by asking the annotators to label both the target attributes and groups.\nTo prevent scams, we also prepared three annotation guideline forms and three aligned labelsets written in English, French, and Modern Standard Arabic with respect to the language of the tweets to be annotated.\nWe requested native speakers to annotate the data and chose annotators with good reputation scores (more than 0.90). We informed the annotator in the guidelines, that in case of noticeable patterns of random labeling on a substantial number of tweets, their work will be rejected and we may have to block them. Since the rejection affects the reputation of the annotators and their chances to get new tasks on Amazon Mechanical Turk, well-reputed annotators are usually reliable. We have divided our corpora into smaller batches on Amazon Mechanical Turk in order to facilitate the analysis of the annotations of the workers and, fairly identify any incoherence patterns possibly caused by the use of an automatic translation system on the tweets, or the repetition of the same annotation schema. If we reject the work of a scam, we notify them, then reassign the tasks to other annotators.\nWe initially put samples of 100 tweets in each of the three languages on Amazon Mechanical Turk. We showed the annotators the tweet along with lists of labels describing (a) whether it is direct or indirect hate speech; (b) if the tweet is dangerous, offensive, hateful, disrespectful, confident or supported by some URL, fearful out of ignorance, or other; (c) the target attribute based on which it discriminates against people, specifically, race, ethnicity, nationality, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, religious affiliation, disability, and other (\u201cother\u201d could refer to political ideologies or social classes.); (d) the name of its target group, and (e) whether the annotators feel anger, sadness, fear or nothing about the tweets.\nEach tweet has been labeled by three annotators. We have provided them with additional text fields to fill in with labels or adjectives that would (1) better describe the tweet, (2) describe how they feel about it more accurately, and (3) name the group of people the tweet shows bias against. We kept the most commonly used labels from our initial labelset, took off some of the initial class names and added frequently introduced labels, especially the emotions of the annotators when reading the tweets and the names of the target groups. For instance, after this step, we have ended up merging race, ethnicity, nationality into one label origin given common confusions we noticed and; added disgust and shock to the emotion labelset; and introduced socialists as a target group label since many annotators have suggested these labels.\nThe final dataset is composed of a pilot corpus of 100 tweets per language, and comparable corpora of 5,647 English tweets, 4,014 French tweets, and 3,353 Arabic tweets. Each of the annotated aspects represents a classification task of its own, that could either be evaluated independently, or, as intended in this paper, tested on how it impacts other tasks. The different labels are designed to facilitate the study of the correlations between the explicitness of the tweet, the type of hostility it conveys, its target attribute, the group it dehumanizes, how different people react to it, and the performance of multitask learning on the five tasks. We assigned each tweet to five annotators, then applied majority voting to each of the labeling tasks. Given the numbers of annotators and labels in each annotation sub-task, we allowed multilabel annotations in the most subjective classification tasks, namely the hostility type and the annotator's sentiment labels, in order to keep the right human-like approximations. If there are two annotators agreeing on two labels respectively, we add both labels to the annotation.\nThe average Krippendorff scores for inter-annotator agreement (IAA) are 0.153, 0.244, and 0.202 for English, French, and Arabic respectively, which are comparable to existing complex annotations BIBREF6 given the nature of the labeling tasks and the number of labels.\nWe present the labelset the annotators refer to, and statistics of our annotated data in the following.\nAnnotators determine the explicitness of the tweet by labeling it as direct or indirect speech. This should be based on whether the target is explicitly named, or less easily discernible, especially if the tweet contains humor, metaphor, or figurative speech. Table TABREF20 shows that even when partly using equivalent keywords to search for candidate tweets, there are still significant differences in the resulting data.\nTo identify the hostility type of the tweet, we stick to the following conventions: (1) if the tweet sounds dangerous, it should be labeled as abusive; (2) according to the degree to which it spreads hate and the tone its author uses, it can be hateful, offensive or disrespectful; (3) if the tweet expresses or spreads fear out of ignorance against a group of individuals, it should be labeled as fearful; (4) otherwise it should be annotated as normal. We define this task to be multilabel. Table TABREF20 shows that hostility types are relatively consistent across different languages and offensive is the most frequent label.\nAfter annotating the pilot dataset, we noticed common misconceptions regarding race, ethnicity, and nationality, therefore we merged these attributes into one label origin. Then, we asked the annotators to determine whether the tweet insults or discriminates against people based on their (1) origin, (2) religious affiliation, (3) gender, (4) sexual orientation, (5) special needs or (6) other. Table TABREF20 shows there are fewer tweets targeting disability in Arabic compared to English and French and no tweets insulting people based on their sexual orientation which may be due to the fact that the labels of gender, gender identity, and sexual orientation use almost the same wording. On the other hand, French contains a small number of tweets targeting people based on their gender in comparison to English and Arabic. We have observed significant differences in terms of target attributes in the three languages. More data may help us examine the problems affecting targets of different linguistic backgrounds.\nWe determined 16 common target groups tagged by the annotators after the first annotation step. The annotators had to decide on whether the tweet is aimed at women, people of African descent, Hispanics, gay people, Asians, Arabs, immigrants in general, refugees; people of different religious affiliations such as Hindu, Christian, Jewish people, and Muslims; or from political ideologies socialists, and others. We also provided the annotators with a category to cover hate directed towards one individual, which cannot be generalized. In case the tweet targets more than one group of people, the annotators should choose the group which would be the most affected by it according to them. Table TABREF10 shows the counts of the five categories out of 16 that commonly occur in the three languages. In fact, most of the tweets target individuals or fall into the \u201cother\u201d category. In the latter case, they may target people with different political views such as liberals or conservatives in English and French, or specific ethnic groups such as Kurdish people in Arabic. English tweets tend to have more tweets targeting people with special needs, due to common language-specific demeaning terms used in conversations where people insult one another. Arabic tweets contain more hateful comments towards women for the same reason. On the other hand, the French corpus contains more tweets that are offensive towards African people, due to hateful comments generated by debates about immigrants.\nWe claim that the choice of a suitable emotion representation model is key to this sub-task, given the subjective nature and social ground of the annotator's sentiment analysis. After collecting the annotation results of the pilot dataset regarding how people feel about the tweets, and observing the added categories, we adopted a range of sentiments that are in the negative and neutral scales of the hourglass of emotions introduced by BIBREF29. This model includes sentiments that are connected to objectively assessed natural language opinions, and excludes what is known as self-conscious or moral emotions such as shame and guilt. Our labels include shock, sadness, disgust, anger, fear, confusion in case of ambivalence, and indifference. This is the second multilabel task of our model.\nTable TABREF20 shows more tweets making the annotators feel disgusted and angry in English, while annotators show more indifference in both French and Arabic. A relatively more frequent label in both French and Arabic is shock, therefore reflecting what some of the annotators were feeling during the labeling process.\nWe report and discuss the results of five classification tasks: (1) the directness of the speech, (2) the hostility type of the tweet, (3) the discriminating target attribute, (4) the target group, and (5) the annotator's sentiment.\nWe compare both traditional baselines using bag-of-words (BOW) as features on Logistic regression (LR), and deep learning based methods.\nFor deep learning based models, we run bidirectional LSTM (biLSTM) models with one hidden layer on each of the classification tasks. Deeper BiLSTM models performed poorly due to the size of the tweets. We chose to use Sluice networks BIBREF8 since they are suitable for loosely related tasks such as the annotated aspects of our corpora.\nWe test different models, namely single task single language (STSL), single task multilingual (STML), and multitask multilingual models (MTML) on our dataset. In multilingual settings, we tested Babylon multilingual word embeddings BIBREF10 and MUSE BIBREF30 on the different tasks. We use Babylon embeddings since they appear to outperform MUSE on our data.\nSluice networks BIBREF8 learn the weights of the neural networks sharing parameters (sluices) jointly with the rest of the model and share an embedding layer, Babylon embeddings in our case, that associates the elements of an input sequence. We use a standard 1-layer BiLSTM partitioned into two subspaces, a shared subspace and a private one, forced to be orthogonal through a regularization penalty term in the loss function in order to enable the multitask network to learn both task-specific and shared representations. The hidden layer has a dimension of 200, the learning rate is initially set to 0.1 with a learning rate decay, and we use the DyNet BIBREF31 automatic minibatch function to speed-up the computation. We initialize the cross-stitch unit to imbalanced, set the standard deviation of the Gaussian noise to 2, and use simple stochastic gradient descent (SGD) as the optimizer.\nAll compared methods use the same split as train:dev:test=8:1:1 and the reported results are based on the test set. We use the dev set to tune the threshold for each binary classification problem in the multilabel classification settings of each task.\nWe report both the micro and macro-F1 scores of the different classification tasks in Tables TABREF27 and TABREF28. Majority refers to labeling based on the majority label, LR to logistic regression, STSL to single task single language models, STML to single task multilingual models, and MTML to multitask multilingual models.\nSTSL performs the best among all models on the directness classification, and it is also consistent in both micro and macro-F1 scores. This is due to the fact that the directness has only two labels and multilabeling is not allowed in this task. Tasks involving imbalanced data, multiclass and multilabel annotations harm the performance of the directness in multitask settings.\nSince macro-F1 is the average of all F1 scores of individual labels, all deep learning models have high macro-F1 scores in English which indicates that they are particularly good at classifying the direct class. STSL is also comparable or better than traditional BOW feature-based classifiers when performed on other tasks in terms of micro-F1 and for most of the macro-F1 scores. This shows the power of the deep learning approach.\nExcept for the directness, MTSL usually outperforms STSL or is comparable to it. When we jointly train each task on the three languages, the performance decreases in most cases, other than the target group classification tasks. This may be due to the difference in label distributions across languages. Yet, multilingual training of the target group classification task improves in all languages. Since the target group classification task involves 16 labels, the amount of data annotated for each label is lower than in other tasks. Hence, when aggregating annotated data in different languages, the size of the training data also increases, due to the relative regularity of identification words of different groups in all three languages in comparison to other tasks.\nMTML settings do not lead to a big improvement which may be due to the class imbalance, multilabel tasks, and the difference in the nature of the tasks. In order to inspect which tasks hurt or help one another, we trained multilingual models for pairwise tasks such as (group, target), (hostility, annotator's sentiment), (hostility, target), (hostility, group), (annotator's sentiment, target) and (annotator's sentiment, group). We noticed that when trained jointly, the target attribute slightly improves the performance of the tweet's hostility type classification by 0.03,0.05 and 0.01 better than the best reported scores in English, French, and Arabic, respectively. When target groups and attributes are trained jointly, the macro F-score of the target group classification in Arabic improves by 0.25 and when we train the tweet's hostility type within the annotator's sentiment, we improve the macro F-score of Arabic by 0.02. We believe that we can take advantage of the correlations between target attributes and groups along with other tasks, to set logic rules and develop better multilingual and multitask settings.\nIn this paper, we presented a multilingual hate speech dataset of English, French, and Arabic tweets. We analyzed in details the difficulties related to the collection and annotation of this dataset. We performed multilingual and multitask learning on our corpora and showed that deep learning models perform better than traditional BOW-based models in most of the multilabel classification tasks. Multilingual multitask learning also helped tasks where each label had less annotated data associated with it. Better tuned deep learning settings in our multilingual and multitask models would be expected to outperform the existing state-of-the-art embeddings and algorithms applied to our data. The different annotation labels and comparable corpora would help us perform transfer learning and investigate how multimodal information on the tweets, additional unlabeled data, label transformation, and label information sharing may boost the classification performance in the future.\nThis paper was supported by the Early Career Scheme (ECS, No. 26206717) from Research Grants Council in Hong Kong, and by postgraduate studentships from the Computer Science and Engineering department of the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.", "question": "What is their definition of hate speech?", "expected_output": "rely on the general public opinion and common linguistic knowledge to assess how people view and react to hate speech.

{"id": "1908.11049", "prompt": "With the expanding amount of text data generated on different social media platforms, current filters are insufficient to prevent the spread of hate speech. Most internet users involved in a study conducted by the Pew Research Center report having been subjected to offensive name calling online or witnessed someone being physically threatened or harassed online. Additionally, Amnesty International within Element AI have lately reported that many women politicians and journalists are assaulted every 30 seconds on Twitter. This is despite the Twitter policy condemning the promotion of violence against people on the basis of race, ethnicity, national origin, sexual orientation, gender identity, religious affiliation, age, disability, or serious disease. Hate speech may not represent the general opinion, yet it promotes the dehumanization of people who are typically from minority groups BIBREF0, BIBREF1 and can incite hate crime BIBREF2.\nMoreover, although people of various linguistic backgrounds are exposed to hate speech BIBREF3, BIBREF2, English is still at the center of existing work on toxic language analysis. Recently, some research studies have been conducted on languages such as German BIBREF4, Arabic BIBREF5, and Italian BIBREF6. However, such studies usually use monolingual corpora and do not contrast, or examine the correlations between online hate speech in different languages. On the other hand, tasks involving more than one language such as the hatEval task, which covers English and Spanish, include only separate classification tasks, namely (a) women and immigrants as target groups, (b) individual or generic hate and, (c) aggressive or non-aggressive hate speech.\nTreating hate speech classification as a binary task may not be enough to inspect the motivation and the behavior of the users promoting it and, how people would react to it. For instance, the hateful tweets presented in Figure FIGREF5 show toxicity directed towards different targets, with or without using slurs, and generating several types of reactions. We believe that, in order to balance between truth and subjectivity, there are at least five important aspects in hate speech analysis. Hence, our annotations indicate (a) whether the text is direct or indirect; (b) if it is offensive, disrespectful, hateful, fearful out of ignorance, abusive, or normal; (c) the attribute based on which it discriminates against an individual or a group of people; (d) the name of this group; and (e) how the annotators feel about its content within a range of negative to neutral sentiments. To the best of our knowledge there are no other hate speech datasets that attempt to capture fear out of ignorance in hateful tweets or examine how people react to hate speech. We claim that our multi-aspect annotation schema would provide a valuable insight into several linguistic and cultural differences and bias in hate speech.\nWe use Amazon Mechanical Turk to label around 13,000 potentially derogatory tweets in English, French, and Arabic based on the above mentioned aspects and, regard each aspect as a prediction task. Since in natural language processing, there is a peculiar interest in multitask learning, where different tasks can be used to help each other BIBREF7, BIBREF8, BIBREF9, we use a unified model to handle the annotated data in all three languages and five tasks. We adopt BIBREF8 as a learning algorithm adapted to loosely related tasks such as our five annotated aspects and, use the Babylon cross-lingual embeddings BIBREF10 to align the three languages. We compare the multilingual multitask learning settings with monolingual multitask, multilingual single-task, and monolingual single-task learning settings respectively. Then, we report the performance results of the different settings and discuss how each task affects the remaining ones. We release our dataset and code to the community to extend research work on multilingual hate speech detection and classification.\nThere is little consensus on the difference between profanity and hate speech and, how to define the latter BIBREF17. As shown in Figure FIGREF11, slurs are not an unequivocal indicator of hate speech and can be part of a non-aggressive conversation, while some of the most offensive comments may come in the form of subtle metaphors or sarcasm BIBREF18. Consequently, there is no existing human annotated vocabulary that explicitly reveals the presence of hate speech, which makes the available hate speech corpora sparse and noisy BIBREF19.\nGiven the subjectivity and the complexity of such data, annotation schemes have rarely been made fine-grained. Table TABREF10 compares different labelsets that exist in the literature. For instance, BIBREF12 use racist, sexist, and normal as labels; BIBREF13 label their data as hateful, offensive (but not hateful), and neither, while BIBREF16 present an English dataset that records the target category based on which hate speech discriminates against people, such as ethnicity, gender, or sexual orientation and ask human annotators to classify the tweets as hate and non hate. BIBREF15 label their data as offensive, abusive, hateful, aggressive, cyberbullying, spam, and normal. On the other hand, BIBREF20 have chosen to detect ideologies of hate speech counting 40 different hate ideologies among 13 extremist hate groups.\nThe detection of hate speech targets is yet another challenging aspect of the annotation. BIBREF21 report the bias that exists in the current datasets towards identity words, such as women, which may later cause false predictions. They propose to debias gender identity word embeddings with additional data for training and tuning their binary classifier. We address this false positive bias problem and the common ambiguity of target detection by asking the annotators to label target attributes such as origin, gender, or religious affiliation within 16 named target groups such as refugees, or immigrants.\nFurthermore, BIBREF22 have reproduced the experiment of BIBREF12 in order to study how hate speech affects the popularity of a tweet, but discovered that some tweets have been deleted. For replication purposes, we provide the community with anonymized tweet texts rather than IDs.\nNon-English hate speech datasets include Italian, German, Dutch, and Arabic corpora. BIBREF6 present a dataset of Italian tweets, in which the annotations capture the degree of intensity of offensive and aggressive tweets, in addition to whether the tweets are ironic and contain stereotypes or not. BIBREF2 have collected more than 500 German tweets against refugees, and annotated them as hateful and not hateful. BIBREF23 detect bullies and victims among youngsters in Dutch comments on AskFM, and classify cyberbullying comments as insults or threats. Moreover, BIBREF5 provide a corpus of Arabic sectarian speech.\nAnother predominant phenomenon in hate speech corpora is code switching. BIBREF24 present a dataset of code mixed Hindi-English tweets, while BIBREF25 report the presence of Hindi tokens in English data and use multilingual word embeddings to deal with this issue when detecting toxicity. Similarly, we use such embeddings to take advantage of the multilinguality and comparability of our corpora during the classification.\nOur dataset is the first trilingual dataset comprising English, French, and Arabic tweets that encompasses various targets and hostility types. Additionally, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that examines how annotators react to hate speech comments.\nTo fully exploit the collected annotations, we tested multitask learning on our dataset. Multitask learning BIBREF7 allows neural networks to share parameters with one another and, thus, learn from related tasks. It has been used in different NLP tasks such as parsing BIBREF9, dependency parsing BIBREF26, neural machine translation BIBREF27, sentiment analysis BIBREF28, and other tasks. Multitask learning architectures tackle challenges that include sharing the label space and the question of private and shared space for loosely related tasks BIBREF8, for which techniques may involve a massive space of potential parameter sharing architectures.\nIn this section, we present our data collection methodology and annotation process.\nConsidering the cultural differences and commonly debated topics in the main geographic regions where English, French, and Arabic are spoken, searching for equivalent terms in the three languages led to different results at first. Therefore, after looking for 1,000 tweets per 15 more or less equivalent phrases in the three languages, we revised our search words three times by questioning the results, adding phrases, and taking off unlikely ones in each of the languages. In fact, we started our data collection by searching for common slurs and demeaning expressions such as \u201cgo back to where you come from\u201d. Then, we observed that discussions about controversial topics, such as feminism in general, illegal immigrants in English, Islamo-gauchisme (\u201cIslamic leftism\") in French, or Iran in Arabic were more likely to provoke disputes, comments filled with toxicity and thus, notable insult patterns that we looked for in subsequent search rounds.\nAll of the annotated tweets include original tweets only, whose content has been processed by (1) deleting unarguably detectable spam tweets, (2) removing unreadable characters and emojis, and (3) masking the names of mentioned users using @user and potentially enclosed URLs using @url. As a result, annotators had to face the lack of context generated by this normalization process.\nFurthermore, we perceived code-switching in English where Hindi, Spanish, and French tokens appear in the tweets. Some French tweets also contain Romanized dialectal Arabic tokens generated by, most likely, bilingual North African Twitter users. Hence, although we eliminated most of these tweets in order to avoid misleading the annotators, the possibly remaining ones still added noise to the data.\nOne more challenge that the annotators and ourselves had to tackle, consisted of Arabic diglossia and switching between different Arabic dialects and Modern Standard Arabic (MSA). While MSA represents the standardized and literary variety of Arabic, there are several Arabic dialects spoken in North Africa and the Middle East in use on Twitter. Therefore, we searched for derogatory terms adapted to different circumstances, and acquired an Arabic corpus that combines tweets written in MSA and Arabic dialects. For instance, the tweet shown in Figure FIGREF5 contains a dialectal slur that means \u201cmaiden.\u201d\nWe rely on the general public opinion and common linguistic knowledge to assess how people view and react to hate speech. Given the subjectivity and difficulty of the task, we reminded the annotators not to let their personal opinions about the topics being discussed in the tweets influence their annotation decisions.\nOur annotation guidelines explained the fact that offensive comments and hate do not necessarily come in the form of profanity. Since different degrees of discrimination work on the dehumanization of individuals or groups of people in distinct ways, we chose not to annotate the tweets within two or three classes. For instance, a sexist comment can be disrespectful, hateful, or offensive towards women. Our initial labelset was established in conformity with the prevalent anti-social behaviors people tend to deal with. We also chose to address the problem of false positives caused by the misleading use of identity words by asking the annotators to label both the target attributes and groups.\nTo prevent scams, we also prepared three annotation guideline forms and three aligned labelsets written in English, French, and Modern Standard Arabic with respect to the language of the tweets to be annotated.\nWe requested native speakers to annotate the data and chose annotators with good reputation scores (more than 0.90). We informed the annotator in the guidelines, that in case of noticeable patterns of random labeling on a substantial number of tweets, their work will be rejected and we may have to block them. Since the rejection affects the reputation of the annotators and their chances to get new tasks on Amazon Mechanical Turk, well-reputed annotators are usually reliable. We have divided our corpora into smaller batches on Amazon Mechanical Turk in order to facilitate the analysis of the annotations of the workers and, fairly identify any incoherence patterns possibly caused by the use of an automatic translation system on the tweets, or the repetition of the same annotation schema. If we reject the work of a scam, we notify them, then reassign the tasks to other annotators.\nWe initially put samples of 100 tweets in each of the three languages on Amazon Mechanical Turk. We showed the annotators the tweet along with lists of labels describing (a) whether it is direct or indirect hate speech; (b) if the tweet is dangerous, offensive, hateful, disrespectful, confident or supported by some URL, fearful out of ignorance, or other; (c) the target attribute based on which it discriminates against people, specifically, race, ethnicity, nationality, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, religious affiliation, disability, and other (\u201cother\u201d could refer to political ideologies or social classes.); (d) the name of its target group, and (e) whether the annotators feel anger, sadness, fear or nothing about the tweets.\nEach tweet has been labeled by three annotators. We have provided them with additional text fields to fill in with labels or adjectives that would (1) better describe the tweet, (2) describe how they feel about it more accurately, and (3) name the group of people the tweet shows bias against. We kept the most commonly used labels from our initial labelset, took off some of the initial class names and added frequently introduced labels, especially the emotions of the annotators when reading the tweets and the names of the target groups. For instance, after this step, we have ended up merging race, ethnicity, nationality into one label origin given common confusions we noticed and; added disgust and shock to the emotion labelset; and introduced socialists as a target group label since many annotators have suggested these labels.\nThe final dataset is composed of a pilot corpus of 100 tweets per language, and comparable corpora of 5,647 English tweets, 4,014 French tweets, and 3,353 Arabic tweets. Each of the annotated aspects represents a classification task of its own, that could either be evaluated independently, or, as intended in this paper, tested on how it impacts other tasks. The different labels are designed to facilitate the study of the correlations between the explicitness of the tweet, the type of hostility it conveys, its target attribute, the group it dehumanizes, how different people react to it, and the performance of multitask learning on the five tasks. We assigned each tweet to five annotators, then applied majority voting to each of the labeling tasks. Given the numbers of annotators and labels in each annotation sub-task, we allowed multilabel annotations in the most subjective classification tasks, namely the hostility type and the annotator's sentiment labels, in order to keep the right human-like approximations. If there are two annotators agreeing on two labels respectively, we add both labels to the annotation.\nThe average Krippendorff scores for inter-annotator agreement (IAA) are 0.153, 0.244, and 0.202 for English, French, and Arabic respectively, which are comparable to existing complex annotations BIBREF6 given the nature of the labeling tasks and the number of labels.\nWe present the labelset the annotators refer to, and statistics of our annotated data in the following.\nAnnotators determine the explicitness of the tweet by labeling it as direct or indirect speech. This should be based on whether the target is explicitly named, or less easily discernible, especially if the tweet contains humor, metaphor, or figurative speech. Table TABREF20 shows that even when partly using equivalent keywords to search for candidate tweets, there are still significant differences in the resulting data.\nTo identify the hostility type of the tweet, we stick to the following conventions: (1) if the tweet sounds dangerous, it should be labeled as abusive; (2) according to the degree to which it spreads hate and the tone its author uses, it can be hateful, offensive or disrespectful; (3) if the tweet expresses or spreads fear out of ignorance against a group of individuals, it should be labeled as fearful; (4) otherwise it should be annotated as normal. We define this task to be multilabel. Table TABREF20 shows that hostility types are relatively consistent across different languages and offensive is the most frequent label.\nAfter annotating the pilot dataset, we noticed common misconceptions regarding race, ethnicity, and nationality, therefore we merged these attributes into one label origin. Then, we asked the annotators to determine whether the tweet insults or discriminates against people based on their (1) origin, (2) religious affiliation, (3) gender, (4) sexual orientation, (5) special needs or (6) other. Table TABREF20 shows there are fewer tweets targeting disability in Arabic compared to English and French and no tweets insulting people based on their sexual orientation which may be due to the fact that the labels of gender, gender identity, and sexual orientation use almost the same wording. On the other hand, French contains a small number of tweets targeting people based on their gender in comparison to English and Arabic. We have observed significant differences in terms of target attributes in the three languages. More data may help us examine the problems affecting targets of different linguistic backgrounds.\nWe determined 16 common target groups tagged by the annotators after the first annotation step. The annotators had to decide on whether the tweet is aimed at women, people of African descent, Hispanics, gay people, Asians, Arabs, immigrants in general, refugees; people of different religious affiliations such as Hindu, Christian, Jewish people, and Muslims; or from political ideologies socialists, and others. We also provided the annotators with a category to cover hate directed towards one individual, which cannot be generalized. In case the tweet targets more than one group of people, the annotators should choose the group which would be the most affected by it according to them. Table TABREF10 shows the counts of the five categories out of 16 that commonly occur in the three languages. In fact, most of the tweets target individuals or fall into the \u201cother\u201d category. In the latter case, they may target people with different political views such as liberals or conservatives in English and French, or specific ethnic groups such as Kurdish people in Arabic. English tweets tend to have more tweets targeting people with special needs, due to common language-specific demeaning terms used in conversations where people insult one another. Arabic tweets contain more hateful comments towards women for the same reason. On the other hand, the French corpus contains more tweets that are offensive towards African people, due to hateful comments generated by debates about immigrants.\nWe claim that the choice of a suitable emotion representation model is key to this sub-task, given the subjective nature and social ground of the annotator's sentiment analysis. After collecting the annotation results of the pilot dataset regarding how people feel about the tweets, and observing the added categories, we adopted a range of sentiments that are in the negative and neutral scales of the hourglass of emotions introduced by BIBREF29. This model includes sentiments that are connected to objectively assessed natural language opinions, and excludes what is known as self-conscious or moral emotions such as shame and guilt. Our labels include shock, sadness, disgust, anger, fear, confusion in case of ambivalence, and indifference. This is the second multilabel task of our model.\nTable TABREF20 shows more tweets making the annotators feel disgusted and angry in English, while annotators show more indifference in both French and Arabic. A relatively more frequent label in both French and Arabic is shock, therefore reflecting what some of the annotators were feeling during the labeling process.\nWe report and discuss the results of five classification tasks: (1) the directness of the speech, (2) the hostility type of the tweet, (3) the discriminating target attribute, (4) the target group, and (5) the annotator's sentiment.\nWe compare both traditional baselines using bag-of-words (BOW) as features on Logistic regression (LR), and deep learning based methods.\nFor deep learning based models, we run bidirectional LSTM (biLSTM) models with one hidden layer on each of the classification tasks. Deeper BiLSTM models performed poorly due to the size of the tweets. We chose to use Sluice networks BIBREF8 since they are suitable for loosely related tasks such as the annotated aspects of our corpora.\nWe test different models, namely single task single language (STSL), single task multilingual (STML), and multitask multilingual models (MTML) on our dataset. In multilingual settings, we tested Babylon multilingual word embeddings BIBREF10 and MUSE BIBREF30 on the different tasks. We use Babylon embeddings since they appear to outperform MUSE on our data.\nSluice networks BIBREF8 learn the weights of the neural networks sharing parameters (sluices) jointly with the rest of the model and share an embedding layer, Babylon embeddings in our case, that associates the elements of an input sequence. We use a standard 1-layer BiLSTM partitioned into two subspaces, a shared subspace and a private one, forced to be orthogonal through a regularization penalty term in the loss function in order to enable the multitask network to learn both task-specific and shared representations. The hidden layer has a dimension of 200, the learning rate is initially set to 0.1 with a learning rate decay, and we use the DyNet BIBREF31 automatic minibatch function to speed-up the computation. We initialize the cross-stitch unit to imbalanced, set the standard deviation of the Gaussian noise to 2, and use simple stochastic gradient descent (SGD) as the optimizer.\nAll compared methods use the same split as train:dev:test=8:1:1 and the reported results are based on the test set. We use the dev set to tune the threshold for each binary classification problem in the multilabel classification settings of each task.\nWe report both the micro and macro-F1 scores of the different classification tasks in Tables TABREF27 and TABREF28. Majority refers to labeling based on the majority label, LR to logistic regression, STSL to single task single language models, STML to single task multilingual models, and MTML to multitask multilingual models.\nSTSL performs the best among all models on the directness classification, and it is also consistent in both micro and macro-F1 scores.

STSL is also comparable or better than traditional BOW feature-based classifiers when performed on other tasks in terms of micro-F1 and for most of the macro-F1 scores. This shows the power of the deep learning approach.\nExcept for the directness, MTSL usually outperforms STSL or is comparable to it.

Consequently, there is no existing human annotated vocabulary that explicitly reveals the presence of hate speech, which makes the available hate speech corpora sparse and noisy BIBREF19.\nGiven the subjectivity and the complexity of such data, annotation schemes have rarely been made fine-grained. Table TABREF10 compares different labelsets that exist in the literature. For instance, BIBREF12 use racist, sexist, and normal as labels; BIBREF13 label their data as hateful, offensive (but not hateful), and neither, while BIBREF16 present an English dataset that records the target category based on which hate speech discriminates against people, such as ethnicity, gender, or sexual orientation and ask human annotators to classify the tweets as hate and non hate. BIBREF15 label their data as offensive, abusive, hateful, aggressive, cyberbullying, spam, and normal. On the other hand, BIBREF20 have chosen to detect ideologies of hate speech counting 40 different hate ideologies among 13 extremist hate groups.\nThe detection of hate speech targets is yet another challenging aspect of the annotation. BIBREF21 report the bias that exists in the current datasets towards identity words, such as women, which may later cause false predictions. They propose to debias gender identity word embeddings with additional data for training and tuning their binary classifier. We address this false positive bias problem and the common ambiguity of target detection by asking the annotators to label target attributes such as origin, gender, or religious affiliation within 16 named target groups such as refugees, or immigrants.\nFurthermore, BIBREF22 have reproduced the experiment of BIBREF12 in order to study how hate speech affects the popularity of a tweet, but discovered that some tweets have been deleted. For replication purposes, we provide the community with anonymized tweet texts rather than IDs.\nNon-English hate speech datasets include Italian, German, Dutch, and Arabic corpora. BIBREF6 present a dataset of Italian tweets, in which the annotations capture the degree of intensity of offensive and aggressive tweets, in addition to whether the tweets are ironic and contain stereotypes or not. BIBREF2 have collected more than 500 German tweets against refugees, and annotated them as hateful and not hateful. BIBREF23 detect bullies and victims among youngsters in Dutch comments on AskFM, and classify cyberbullying comments as insults or threats. Moreover, BIBREF5 provide a corpus of Arabic sectarian speech.\nAnother predominant phenomenon in hate speech corpora is code switching. BIBREF24 present a dataset of code mixed Hindi-English tweets, while BIBREF25 report the presence of Hindi tokens in English data and use multilingual word embeddings to deal with this issue when detecting toxicity. Similarly, we use such embeddings to take advantage of the multilinguality and comparability of our corpora during the classification.\nOur dataset is the first trilingual dataset comprising English, French, and Arabic tweets that encompasses various targets and hostility types. Additionally, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that examines how annotators react to hate speech comments.\nTo fully exploit the collected annotations, we tested multitask learning on our dataset. Multitask learning BIBREF7 allows neural networks to share parameters with one another and, thus, learn from related tasks. It has been used in different NLP tasks such as parsing BIBREF9, dependency parsing BIBREF26, neural machine translation BIBREF27, sentiment analysis BIBREF28, and other tasks. Multitask learning architectures tackle challenges that include sharing the label space and the question of private and shared space for loosely related tasks BIBREF8, for which techniques may involve a massive space of potential parameter sharing architectures.\nIn this section, we present our data collection methodology and annotation process.\nConsidering the cultural differences and commonly debated topics in the main geographic regions where English, French, and Arabic are spoken, searching for equivalent terms in the three languages led to different results at first. Therefore, after looking for 1,000 tweets per 15 more or less equivalent phrases in the three languages, we revised our search words three times by questioning the results, adding phrases, and taking off unlikely ones in each of the languages. In fact, we started our data collection by searching for common slurs and demeaning expressions such as \u201cgo back to where you come from\u201d. Then, we observed that discussions about controversial topics, such as feminism in general, illegal immigrants in English, Islamo-gauchisme (\u201cIslamic leftism\") in French, or Iran in Arabic were more likely to provoke disputes, comments filled with toxicity and thus, notable insult patterns that we looked for in subsequent search rounds.\nAll of the annotated tweets include original tweets only, whose content has been processed by (1) deleting unarguably detectable spam tweets, (2) removing unreadable characters and emojis, and (3) masking the names of mentioned users using @user and potentially enclosed URLs using @url. As a result, annotators had to face the lack of context generated by this normalization process.\nFurthermore, we perceived code-switching in English where Hindi, Spanish, and French tokens appear in the tweets. Some French tweets also contain Romanized dialectal Arabic tokens generated by, most likely, bilingual North African Twitter users. Hence, although we eliminated most of these tweets in order to avoid misleading the annotators, the possibly remaining ones still added noise to the data.\nOne more challenge that the annotators and ourselves had to tackle, consisted of Arabic diglossia and switching between different Arabic dialects and Modern Standard Arabic (MSA). While MSA represents the standardized and literary variety of Arabic, there are several Arabic dialects spoken in North Africa and the Middle East in use on Twitter. Therefore, we searched for derogatory terms adapted to different circumstances, and acquired an Arabic corpus that combines tweets written in MSA and Arabic dialects. For instance, the tweet shown in Figure FIGREF5 contains a dialectal slur that means \u201cmaiden.\u201d\nWe rely on the general public opinion and common linguistic knowledge to assess how people view and react to hate speech. Given the subjectivity and difficulty of the task, we reminded the annotators not to let their personal opinions about the topics being discussed in the tweets influence their annotation decisions.\nOur annotation guidelines explained the fact that offensive comments and hate do not necessarily come in the form of profanity. Since different degrees of discrimination work on the dehumanization of individuals or groups of people in distinct ways, we chose not to annotate the tweets within two or three classes. For instance, a sexist comment can be disrespectful, hateful, or offensive towards women. Our initial labelset was established in conformity with the prevalent anti-social behaviors people tend to deal with. We also chose to address the problem of false positives caused by the misleading use of identity words by asking the annotators to label both the target attributes and groups.\nTo prevent scams, we also prepared three annotation guideline forms and three aligned labelsets written in English, French, and Modern Standard Arabic with respect to the language of the tweets to be annotated.\nWe requested native speakers to annotate the data and chose annotators with good reputation scores (more than 0.90). We informed the annotator in the guidelines, that in case of noticeable patterns of random labeling on a substantial number of tweets, their work will be rejected and we may have to block them. Since the rejection affects the reputation of the annotators and their chances to get new tasks on Amazon Mechanical Turk, well-reputed annotators are usually reliable. We have divided our corpora into smaller batches on Amazon Mechanical Turk in order to facilitate the analysis of the annotations of the workers and, fairly identify any incoherence patterns possibly caused by the use of an automatic translation system on the tweets, or the repetition of the same annotation schema. If we reject the work of a scam, we notify them, then reassign the tasks to other annotators.\nWe initially put samples of 100 tweets in each of the three languages on Amazon Mechanical Turk. We showed the annotators the tweet along with lists of labels describing (a) whether it is direct or indirect hate speech; (b) if the tweet is dangerous, offensive, hateful, disrespectful, confident or supported by some URL, fearful out of ignorance, or other; (c) the target attribute based on which it discriminates against people, specifically, race, ethnicity, nationality, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, religious affiliation, disability, and other (\u201cother\u201d could refer to political ideologies or social classes.); (d) the name of its target group, and (e) whether the annotators feel anger, sadness, fear or nothing about the tweets.\nEach tweet has been labeled by three annotators. We have provided them with additional text fields to fill in with labels or adjectives that would (1) better describe the tweet, (2) describe how they feel about it more accurately, and (3) name the group of people the tweet shows bias against. We kept the most commonly used labels from our initial labelset, took off some of the initial class names and added frequently introduced labels, especially the emotions of the annotators when reading the tweets and the names of the target groups. For instance, after this step, we have ended up merging race, ethnicity, nationality into one label origin given common confusions we noticed and; added disgust and shock to the emotion labelset; and introduced socialists as a target group label since many annotators have suggested these labels.\nThe final dataset is composed of a pilot corpus of 100 tweets per language, and comparable corpora of 5,647 English tweets, 4,014 French tweets, and 3,353 Arabic tweets. Each of the annotated aspects represents a classification task of its own, that could either be evaluated independently, or, as intended in this paper, tested on how it impacts other tasks. The different labels are designed to facilitate the study of the correlations between the explicitness of the tweet, the type of hostility it conveys, its target attribute, the group it dehumanizes, how different people react to it, and the performance of multitask learning on the five tasks. We assigned each tweet to five annotators, then applied majority voting to each of the labeling tasks. Given the numbers of annotators and labels in each annotation sub-task, we allowed multilabel annotations in the most subjective classification tasks, namely the hostility type and the annotator's sentiment labels, in order to keep the right human-like approximations. If there are two annotators agreeing on two labels respectively, we add both labels to the annotation.\nThe average Krippendorff scores for inter-annotator agreement (IAA) are 0.153, 0.244, and 0.202 for English, French, and Arabic respectively, which are comparable to existing complex annotations BIBREF6 given the nature of the labeling tasks and the number of labels.\nWe present the labelset the annotators refer to, and statistics of our annotated data in the following.\nAnnotators determine the explicitness of the tweet by labeling it as direct or indirect speech. This should be based on whether the target is explicitly named, or less easily discernible, especially if the tweet contains humor, metaphor, or figurative speech. Table TABREF20 shows that even when partly using equivalent keywords to search for candidate tweets, there are still significant differences in the resulting data.\nTo identify the hostility type of the tweet, we stick to the following conventions: (1) if the tweet sounds dangerous, it should be labeled as abusive; (2) according to the degree to which it spreads hate and the tone its author uses, it can be hateful, offensive or disrespectful; (3) if the tweet expresses or spreads fear out of ignorance against a group of individuals, it should be labeled as fearful; (4) otherwise it should be annotated as normal. We define this task to be multilabel. Table TABREF20 shows that hostility types are relatively consistent across different languages and offensive is the most frequent label.\nAfter annotating the pilot dataset, we noticed common misconceptions regarding race, ethnicity, and nationality, therefore we merged these attributes into one label origin. Then, we asked the annotators to determine whether the tweet insults or discriminates against people based on their (1) origin, (2) religious affiliation, (3) gender, (4) sexual orientation, (5) special needs or (6) other. Table TABREF20 shows there are fewer tweets targeting disability in Arabic compared to English and French and no tweets insulting people based on their sexual orientation which may be due to the fact that the labels of gender, gender identity, and sexual orientation use almost the same wording. On the other hand, French contains a small number of tweets targeting people based on their gender in comparison to English and Arabic. We have observed significant differences in terms of target attributes in the three languages. More data may help us examine the problems affecting targets of different linguistic backgrounds.\nWe determined 16 common target groups tagged by the annotators after the first annotation step. The annotators had to decide on whether the tweet is aimed at women, people of African descent, Hispanics, gay people, Asians, Arabs, immigrants in general, refugees; people of different religious affiliations such as Hindu, Christian, Jewish people, and Muslims; or from political ideologies socialists, and others. We also provided the annotators with a category to cover hate directed towards one individual, which cannot be generalized. In case the tweet targets more than one group of people, the annotators should choose the group which would be the most affected by it according to them. Table TABREF10 shows the counts of the five categories out of 16 that commonly occur in the three languages. In fact, most of the tweets target individuals or fall into the \u201cother\u201d category. In the latter case, they may target people with different political views such as liberals or conservatives in English and French, or specific ethnic groups such as Kurdish people in Arabic. English tweets tend to have more tweets targeting people with special needs, due to common language-specific demeaning terms used in conversations where people insult one another. Arabic tweets contain more hateful comments towards women for the same reason. On the other hand, the French corpus contains more tweets that are offensive towards African people, due to hateful comments generated by debates about immigrants.\nWe claim that the choice of a suitable emotion representation model is key to this sub-task, given the subjective nature and social ground of the annotator's sentiment analysis. After collecting the annotation results of the pilot dataset regarding how people feel about the tweets, and observing the added categories, we adopted a range of sentiments that are in the negative and neutral scales of the hourglass of emotions introduced by BIBREF29. This model includes sentiments that are connected to objectively assessed natural language opinions, and excludes what is known as self-conscious or moral emotions such as shame and guilt. Our labels include shock, sadness, disgust, anger, fear, confusion in case of ambivalence, and indifference. This is the second multilabel task of our model.\nTable TABREF20 shows more tweets making the annotators feel disgusted and angry in English, while annotators show more indifference in both French and Arabic. A relatively more frequent label in both French and Arabic is shock, therefore reflecting what some of the annotators were feeling during the labeling process.\nWe report and discuss the results of five classification tasks: (1) the directness of the speech, (2) the hostility type of the tweet, (3) the discriminating target attribute, (4) the target group, and (5) the annotator's sentiment.\nWe compare both traditional baselines using bag-of-words (BOW) as features on Logistic regression (LR), and deep learning based methods.\nFor deep learning based models, we run bidirectional LSTM (biLSTM) models with one hidden layer on each of the classification tasks. Deeper BiLSTM models performed poorly due to the size of the tweets. We chose to use Sluice networks BIBREF8 since they are suitable for loosely related tasks such as the annotated aspects of our corpora.\nWe test different models, namely single task single language (STSL), single task multilingual (STML), and multitask multilingual models (MTML) on our dataset. In multilingual settings, we tested Babylon multilingual word embeddings BIBREF10 and MUSE BIBREF30 on the different tasks. We use Babylon embeddings since they appear to outperform MUSE on our data.\nSluice networks BIBREF8 learn the weights of the neural networks sharing parameters (sluices) jointly with the rest of the model and share an embedding layer, Babylon embeddings in our case, that associates the elements of an input sequence. We use a standard 1-layer BiLSTM partitioned into two subspaces, a shared subspace and a private one, forced to be orthogonal through a regularization penalty term in the loss function in order to enable the multitask network to learn both task-specific and shared representations. The hidden layer has a dimension of 200, the learning rate is initially set to 0.1 with a learning rate decay, and we use the DyNet BIBREF31 automatic minibatch function to speed-up the computation. We initialize the cross-stitch unit to imbalanced, set the standard deviation of the Gaussian noise to 2, and use simple stochastic gradient descent (SGD) as the optimizer.\nAll compared methods use the same split as train:dev:test=8:1:1 and the reported results are based on the test set. We use the dev set to tune the threshold for each binary classification problem in the multilabel classification settings of each task.\nWe report both the micro and macro-F1 scores of the different classification tasks in Tables TABREF27 and TABREF28. Majority refers to labeling based on the majority label, LR to logistic regression, STSL to single task single language models, STML to single task multilingual models, and MTML to multitask multilingual models.\nSTSL performs the best among all models on the directness classification, and it is also consistent in both micro and macro-F1 scores. This is due to the fact that the directness has only two labels and multilabeling is not allowed in this task. Tasks involving imbalanced data, multiclass and multilabel annotations harm the performance of the directness in multitask settings.\nSince macro-F1 is the average of all F1 scores of individual labels, all deep learning models have high macro-F1 scores in English which indicates that they are particularly good at classifying the direct class. STSL is also comparable or better than traditional BOW feature-based classifiers when performed on other tasks in terms of micro-F1 and for most of the macro-F1 scores. This shows the power of the deep learning approach.\nExcept for the directness, MTSL usually outperforms STSL or is comparable to it. When we jointly train each task on the three languages, the performance decreases in most cases, other than the target group classification tasks. This may be due to the difference in label distributions across languages. Yet, multilingual training of the target group classification task improves in all languages. Since the target group classification task involves 16 labels, the amount of data annotated for each label is lower than in other tasks. Hence, when aggregating annotated data in different languages, the size of the training data also increases, due to the relative regularity of identification words of different groups in all three languages in comparison to other tasks.\nMTML settings do not lead to a big improvement which may be due to the class imbalance, multilabel tasks, and the difference in the nature of the tasks. In order to inspect which tasks hurt or help one another, we trained multilingual models for pairwise tasks such as (group, target), (hostility, annotator's sentiment), (hostility, target), (hostility, group), (annotator's sentiment, target) and (annotator's sentiment, group). We noticed that when trained jointly, the target attribute slightly improves the performance of the tweet's hostility type classification by 0.03,0.05 and 0.01 better than the best reported scores in English, French, and Arabic, respectively. When target groups and attributes are trained jointly, the macro F-score of the target group classification in Arabic improves by 0.25 and when we train the tweet's hostility type within the annotator's sentiment, we improve the macro F-score of Arabic by 0.02. We believe that we can take advantage of the correlations between target attributes and groups along with other tasks, to set logic rules and develop better multilingual and multitask settings.\nIn this paper, we presented a multilingual hate speech dataset of English, French, and Arabic tweets. We analyzed in details the difficulties related to the collection and annotation of this dataset. We performed multilingual and multitask learning on our corpora and showed that deep learning models perform better than traditional BOW-based models in most of the multilabel classification tasks. Multilingual multitask learning also helped tasks where each label had less annotated data associated with it. Better tuned deep learning settings in our multilingual and multitask models would be expected to outperform the existing state-of-the-art embeddings and algorithms applied to our data. The different annotation labels and comparable corpora would help us perform transfer learning and investigate how multimodal information on the tweets, additional unlabeled data, label transformation, and label information sharing may boost the classification performance in the future.\nThis paper was supported by the Early Career Scheme (ECS, No. 26206717) from Research Grants Council in Hong Kong, and by postgraduate studentships from the Computer Science and Engineering department of the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.", "question": "What aspects are considered?", "expected_output": "(a) whether the text is direct or indirect; (b) if it is offensive, disrespectful, hateful, fearful out of ignorance, abusive, or normal; (c) the attribute based on which it discriminates against an individual or a group of people; (d) the name of this group; and (e) how the annotators feel about its content within a range of negative to neutral sentiments. Explanation: We believe that, in order to balance between truth and subjectivity, there are at least five important aspects in hate speech analysis. Hence, our annotations indicate (a) whether the text is direct or indirect; (b) if it is offensive, disrespectful, hateful, fearful out of ignorance, abusive, or normal; (c) the attribute based on which it discriminates against an individual or a group of people; (d) the name of this group; and (e) how the annotators feel about its content within a range of negative to neutral sentiments.", "generated_answer": ""}
{"id": "1908.11049", "prompt": "With the expanding amount of text data generated on different social media platforms, current filters are insufficient to prevent the spread of hate speech. Most internet users involved in a study conducted by the Pew Research Center report having been subjected to offensive name calling online or witnessed someone being physically threatened or harassed online. Additionally, Amnesty International within Element AI have lately reported that many women politicians and journalists are assaulted every 30 seconds on Twitter. This is despite the Twitter policy condemning the promotion of violence against people on the basis of race, ethnicity, national origin, sexual orientation, gender identity, religious affiliation, age, disability, or serious disease. Hate speech may not represent the general opinion, yet it promotes the dehumanization of people who are typically from minority groups BIBREF0, BIBREF1 and can incite hate crime BIBREF2.\nMoreover, although people of various linguistic backgrounds are exposed to hate speech BIBREF3, BIBREF2, English is still at the center of existing work on toxic language analysis. Recently, some research studies have been conducted on languages such as German BIBREF4, Arabic BIBREF5, and Italian BIBREF6. However, such studies usually use monolingual corpora and do not contrast, or examine the correlations between online hate speech in different languages. On the other hand, tasks involving more than one language such as the hatEval task, which covers English and Spanish, include only separate classification tasks, namely (a) women and immigrants as target groups, (b) individual or generic hate and, (c) aggressive or non-aggressive hate speech.\nTreating hate speech classification as a binary task may not be enough to inspect the motivation and the behavior of the users promoting it and, how people would react to it. For instance, the hateful tweets presented in Figure FIGREF5 show toxicity directed towards different targets, with or without using slurs, and generating several types of reactions. We believe that, in order to balance between truth and subjectivity, there are at least five important aspects in hate speech analysis. Hence, our annotations indicate (a) whether the text is direct or indirect; (b) if it is offensive, disrespectful, hateful, fearful out of ignorance, abusive, or normal; (c) the attribute based on which it discriminates against an individual or a group of people; (d) the name of this group; and (e) how the annotators feel about its content within a range of negative to neutral sentiments. To the best of our knowledge there are no other hate speech datasets that attempt to capture fear out of ignorance in hateful tweets or examine how people react to hate speech. We claim that our multi-aspect annotation schema would provide a valuable insight into several linguistic and cultural differences and bias in hate speech.\nWe use Amazon Mechanical Turk to label around 13,000 potentially derogatory tweets in English, French, and Arabic based on the above mentioned aspects and, regard each aspect as a prediction task. Since in natural language processing, there is a peculiar interest in multitask learning, where different tasks can be used to help each other BIBREF7, BIBREF8, BIBREF9, we use a unified model to handle the annotated data in all three languages and five tasks. We adopt BIBREF8 as a learning algorithm adapted to loosely related tasks such as our five annotated aspects and, use the Babylon cross-lingual embeddings BIBREF10 to align the three languages. We compare the multilingual multitask learning settings with monolingual multitask, multilingual single-task, and monolingual single-task learning settings respectively. Then, we report the performance results of the different settings and discuss how each task affects the remaining ones. We release our dataset and code to the community to extend research work on multilingual hate speech detection and classification.\nThere is little consensus on the difference between profanity and hate speech and, how to define the latter BIBREF17. As shown in Figure FIGREF11, slurs are not an unequivocal indicator of hate speech and can be part of a non-aggressive conversation, while some of the most offensive comments may come in the form of subtle metaphors or sarcasm BIBREF18.

Given the numbers of annotators and labels in each annotation sub-task, we allowed multilabel annotations in the most subjective classification tasks, namely the hostility type and the annotator's sentiment labels, in order to keep the right human-like approximations. If there are two annotators agreeing on two labels respectively, we add both labels to the annotation.\nThe average Krippendorff scores for inter-annotator agreement (IAA) are 0.153, 0.244, and 0.202 for English, French, and Arabic respectively, which are comparable to existing complex annotations BIBREF6 given the nature of the labeling tasks and the number of labels.\nWe present the labelset the annotators refer to, and statistics of our annotated data in the following.\nAnnotators determine the explicitness of the tweet by labeling it as direct or indirect speech. This should be based on whether the target is explicitly named, or less easily discernible, especially if the tweet contains humor, metaphor, or figurative speech. Table TABREF20 shows that even when partly using equivalent keywords to search for candidate tweets, there are still significant differences in the resulting data.\nTo identify the hostility type of the tweet, we stick to the following conventions: (1) if the tweet sounds dangerous, it should be labeled as abusive; (2) according to the degree to which it spreads hate and the tone its author uses, it can be hateful, offensive or disrespectful; (3) if the tweet expresses or spreads fear out of ignorance against a group of individuals, it should be labeled as fearful; (4) otherwise it should be annotated as normal. We define this task to be multilabel. Table TABREF20 shows that hostility types are relatively consistent across different languages and offensive is the most frequent label.\nAfter annotating the pilot dataset, we noticed common misconceptions regarding race, ethnicity, and nationality, therefore we merged these attributes into one label origin. Then, we asked the annotators to determine whether the tweet insults or discriminates against people based on their (1) origin, (2) religious affiliation, (3) gender, (4) sexual orientation, (5) special needs or (6) other. Table TABREF20 shows there are fewer tweets targeting disability in Arabic compared to English and French and no tweets insulting people based on their sexual orientation which may be due to the fact that the labels of gender, gender identity, and sexual orientation use almost the same wording. On the other hand, French contains a small number of tweets targeting people based on their gender in comparison to English and Arabic. We have observed significant differences in terms of target attributes in the three languages. More data may help us examine the problems affecting targets of different linguistic backgrounds.\nWe determined 16 common target groups tagged by the annotators after the first annotation step. The annotators had to decide on whether the tweet is aimed at women, people of African descent, Hispanics, gay people, Asians, Arabs, immigrants in general, refugees; people of different religious affiliations such as Hindu, Christian, Jewish people, and Muslims; or from political ideologies socialists, and others. We also provided the annotators with a category to cover hate directed towards one individual, which cannot be generalized. In case the tweet targets more than one group of people, the annotators should choose the group which would be the most affected by it according to them. Table TABREF10 shows the counts of the five categories out of 16 that commonly occur in the three languages. In fact, most of the tweets target individuals or fall into the \u201cother\u201d category. In the latter case, they may target people with different political views such as liberals or conservatives in English and French, or specific ethnic groups such as Kurdish people in Arabic. English tweets tend to have more tweets targeting people with special needs, due to common language-specific demeaning terms used in conversations where people insult one another. Arabic tweets contain more hateful comments towards women for the same reason. On the other hand, the French corpus contains more tweets that are offensive towards African people, due to hateful comments generated by debates about immigrants.\nWe claim that the choice of a suitable emotion representation model is key to this sub-task, given the subjective nature and social ground of the annotator's sentiment analysis. After collecting the annotation results of the pilot dataset regarding how people feel about the tweets, and observing the added categories, we adopted a range of sentiments that are in the negative and neutral scales of the hourglass of emotions introduced by BIBREF29. This model includes sentiments that are connected to objectively assessed natural language opinions, and excludes what is known as self-conscious or moral emotions such as shame and guilt. Our labels include shock, sadness, disgust, anger, fear, confusion in case of ambivalence, and indifference. This is the second multilabel task of our model.\nTable TABREF20 shows more tweets making the annotators feel disgusted and angry in English, while annotators show more indifference in both French and Arabic. A relatively more frequent label in both French and Arabic is shock, therefore reflecting what some of the annotators were feeling during the labeling process.\nWe report and discuss the results of five classification tasks: (1) the directness of the speech, (2) the hostility type of the tweet, (3) the discriminating target attribute, (4) the target group, and (5) the annotator's sentiment.\nWe compare both traditional baselines using bag-of-words (BOW) as features on Logistic regression (LR), and deep learning based methods.\nFor deep learning based models, we run bidirectional LSTM (biLSTM) models with one hidden layer on each of the classification tasks. Deeper BiLSTM models performed poorly due to the size of the tweets. We chose to use Sluice networks BIBREF8 since they are suitable for loosely related tasks such as the annotated aspects of our corpora.\nWe test different models, namely single task single language (STSL), single task multilingual (STML), and multitask multilingual models (MTML) on our dataset. In multilingual settings, we tested Babylon multilingual word embeddings BIBREF10 and MUSE BIBREF30 on the different tasks. We use Babylon embeddings since they appear to outperform MUSE on our data.\nSluice networks BIBREF8 learn the weights of the neural networks sharing parameters (sluices) jointly with the rest of the model and share an embedding layer, Babylon embeddings in our case, that associates the elements of an input sequence. We use a standard 1-layer BiLSTM partitioned into two subspaces, a shared subspace and a private one, forced to be orthogonal through a regularization penalty term in the loss function in order to enable the multitask network to learn both task-specific and shared representations. The hidden layer has a dimension of 200, the learning rate is initially set to 0.1 with a learning rate decay, and we use the DyNet BIBREF31 automatic minibatch function to speed-up the computation. We initialize the cross-stitch unit to imbalanced, set the standard deviation of the Gaussian noise to 2, and use simple stochastic gradient descent (SGD) as the optimizer.\nAll compared methods use the same split as train:dev:test=8:1:1 and the reported results are based on the test set. We use the dev set to tune the threshold for each binary classification problem in the multilabel classification settings of each task.\nWe report both the micro and macro-F1 scores of the different classification tasks in Tables TABREF27 and TABREF28. Majority refers to labeling based on the majority label, LR to logistic regression, STSL to single task single language models, STML to single task multilingual models, and MTML to multitask multilingual models.\nSTSL performs the best among all models on the directness classification, and it is also consistent in both micro and macro-F1 scores. This is due to the fact that the directness has only two labels and multilabeling is not allowed in this task. Tasks involving imbalanced data, multiclass and multilabel annotations harm the performance of the directness in multitask settings.\nSince macro-F1 is the average of all F1 scores of individual labels, all deep learning models have high macro-F1 scores in English which indicates that they are particularly good at classifying the direct class. STSL is also comparable or better than traditional BOW feature-based classifiers when performed on other tasks in terms of micro-F1 and for most of the macro-F1 scores. This shows the power of the deep learning approach.\nExcept for the directness, MTSL usually outperforms STSL or is comparable to it. When we jointly train each task on the three languages, the performance decreases in most cases, other than the target group classification tasks. This may be due to the difference in label distributions across languages. Yet, multilingual training of the target group classification task improves in all languages. Since the target group classification task involves 16 labels, the amount of data annotated for each label is lower than in other tasks. Hence, when aggregating annotated data in different languages, the size of the training data also increases, due to the relative regularity of identification words of different groups in all three languages in comparison to other tasks.\nMTML settings do not lead to a big improvement which may be due to the class imbalance, multilabel tasks, and the difference in the nature of the tasks. In order to inspect which tasks hurt or help one another, we trained multilingual models for pairwise tasks such as (group, target), (hostility, annotator's sentiment), (hostility, target), (hostility, group), (annotator's sentiment, target) and (annotator's sentiment, group). We noticed that when trained jointly, the target attribute slightly improves the performance of the tweet's hostility type classification by 0.03,0.05 and 0.01 better than the best reported scores in English, French, and Arabic, respectively. When target groups and attributes are trained jointly, the macro F-score of the target group classification in Arabic improves by 0.25 and when we train the tweet's hostility type within the annotator's sentiment, we improve the macro F-score of Arabic by 0.02. We believe that we can take advantage of the correlations between target attributes and groups along with other tasks, to set logic rules and develop better multilingual and multitask settings.\nIn this paper, we presented a multilingual hate speech dataset of English, French, and Arabic tweets. We analyzed in details the difficulties related to the collection and annotation of this dataset. We performed multilingual and multitask learning on our corpora and showed that deep learning models perform better than traditional BOW-based models in most of the multilabel classification tasks. Multilingual multitask learning also helped tasks where each label had less annotated data associated with it. Better tuned deep learning settings in our multilingual and multitask models would be expected to outperform the existing state-of-the-art embeddings and algorithms applied to our data. The different annotation labels and comparable corpora would help us perform transfer learning and investigate how multimodal information on the tweets, additional unlabeled data, label transformation, and label information sharing may boost the classification performance in the future.\nThis paper was supported by the Early Career Scheme (ECS, No. 26206717) from Research Grants Council in Hong Kong, and by postgraduate studentships from the Computer Science and Engineering department of the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.", "question": "How big is their dataset?", "expected_output": "13 000 tweets.

{"id": "1907.10676", "prompt": "Alongside increasing globalization comes a greater need for readers to understand texts in languages foreign to them. For example, approximately 48% of the pages on the Web are not available in English. The technological progress of recent decades has made both the distribution and access to content in different languages ever simpler. Translation aims to support users who need to access content in a language in which they are not fluent BIBREF0 .\nHowever, translation is a difficult task due to the complexity of natural languages and their structure BIBREF0 . In addition, manual translation does not scale to the magnitude of the Web. One remedy for this problem is MT. The main goal of MT is to enable people to assess content in languages other than the languages in which they are fluent BIBREF1 . From a formal point of view, this means that the goal of MT is to transfer the semantics of text from an input language to an output language BIBREF2 .\nAlthough MT systems are now popular on the Web, they still generate a large number of incorrect translations. Recently, Popovi\u0107 BIBREF3 has classified five types of errors that still remain in MT systems. According to research, the two main faults that are responsible for 40% and 30% of problems respectively, are reordering errors and lexical and syntactic ambiguity. Thus, addressing these barriers is a key challenge for modern translation systems. A large number of MT approaches have been developed over the years that could potentially serve as a remedy. For instance, translators began by using methodologies based on linguistics which led to the family of RBMT. However, RBMT systems have a critical drawback in their reliance on manually crafted rules, thus making the development of new translation modules for different languages even more difficult.\nSMT and EBMT were developed to deal with the scalability issue in RBMT BIBREF4 , a necessary characteristic of MT systems that must deal with data at Web scale. Presently, these approaches have begun to address the drawbacks of rule-based approaches. However, some problems that had already been solved for linguistics based methods reappeared. The majority of these problems are connected to the issue of ambiguity, including syntactic and semantic variations BIBREF0 . Nowadays, a novel SMT paradigm has arisen called NMT which relies on NN algorithms. NMT has been achieving impressive results and is now the state-of-the-art in MT approaches. However, NMT is still a statistical approach sharing some semantic drawbacks from other well-defined SMT approaches BIBREF5 .\nOne possible solution to address the remaining issues of MT lies in the use of SWT, which have emerged over recent decades as a paradigm to make the semantics of content explicit so that it can be used by machines. It is believed that explicit semantic knowledge made available through these technologies can empower MT systems to supply translations with significantly better quality while remaining scalable. In particular, the disambiguated knowledge about real-world entities, their properties and their relationships made available on the LD Web can potentially be used to infer the right meaning of ambiguous sentences or words.\nAccording to our survey BIBREF6 , the obvious opportunity of using SWT for MT has already been studied by a number of approaches, especially w.r.t. the issue of ambiguity. In this paper, we present the challenges and opportunities in the use of SWT in MT for translating texts.\nThe idea of using a structured KB in MT systems started in the 90s with the work of Knight and Luk BIBREF7 . Still, only a few researchers have designed different strategies for benefiting of structured knowledge in MT architectures BIBREF8 . Recently, the idea of using KG into MT systems has gained renewed attention. Du et al. BIBREF9 created an approach to address the problem of OOV words by using BabelNet BIBREF10 . Their approach applies different methods of using BabelNet. In summary, they create additional training data and apply a post-editing technique, which replaces the OOV words while querying BabelNet. Shi et al. BIBREF11 have recently built a semantic embedding model reliant upon a specific KB to be used in NMT systems. The model relies on semantic embeddings to encode the key information contained in words to translate the meaning of sentences correctly. The work consists of mapping a source sentence to triples, which are then used to extract the intrinsic meaning of words to generate a target sentence. This mapping results in a semantic embedding model containing KB triples, which are responsible for gathering the key information of each word in the sentences.\nThe most problematic unresolved MT challenges, from our point of view, which are still experienced by the aforementioned MT approaches are the following:\nAdditionally, there are five MT open challenges posed by Lopez and Post BIBREF12 which we describe more generically below.\n(1) Excessive focus on English and European languages as one of the involved languages in MT approaches and poor research on low-resource language pairs such as African and/or South American languages. (2) The limitations of SMT approaches for translating across domains. Most MT systems exhibit good performance on law and the legislative domains due to the large amount of data provided by the European Union. In contrast, translations performed on sports and life-hacks commonly fail, because of the lack of training data. (3) How to translate the huge amount of data from social networks that uniquely deal with no-standard speech texts from users (e.g., tweets). (4) The difficult translations among morphologically rich languages. This challenge shares the same problem with the first one, namely that most research work focuses on English as one of the involved languages. Therefore, MT systems which translate content between, for instance, Arabic and Spanish are rare. (5) For the speech translation task, the parallel data for training differs widely from real user speech.\nThe challenges above are clearly not independent, which means that addressing one of them can have an impact on the others. Since NMT has shown impressive results on reordering, the main problem turns out to be the disambiguation process (both syntactically and semantically) in SMT approaches BIBREF0 .\nBased on the surveyed works on our research BIBREF6 , SWT have mostly been applied at the semantic analysis step, rather than at the other stages of the translation process, due to their ability to deal with concepts behind the words and provide knowledge about them. As SWT have developed, they have increasingly been able to resolve some of the open challenges of MT. They may be applied in different ways according to each MT approach.\nDisambiguation. Human language is very ambiguous. Most words have multiple interpretations depending on the context in which they are mentioned. In the MT field, WSD techniques are concerned with finding the respective meaning and correct translation to these ambiguous words in target languages. This ambiguity problem was identified early in MT development. In 1960 Bar-Hillel BIBREF1 stated that an MT system is not able to find the right meaning without a specific knowledge. Although the ambiguity problem has been lessened significantly since the contribution of Carpuat and subsequent works BIBREF13 , this problem still remains a challenge. As seen in Moussallem et al. BIBREF6 , MT systems still try to resolve this problem by using domain specific language models to prefer domain specific expressions, but when translating a highly ambiguous sentence or a short text which covers multiple domains, the languages models are not enough.\nSW has already shown its capability for semantic disambiguation of polysemous and homonymous words. However, SWT were applied in two ways to support the semantic disambiguation in MT. First, the ambiguous words were recognized in the source text before carrying out the translation, applying a pre-editing technique. Second, SWT were applied to the output translation in the target language as a post-editing technique. Although applying one of these techniques has increased the quality of a translation, both techniques are tedious to implement when they have to translate common words instead of named entities, then be applied several times to achieve a successful translation.\nThe real benefit of SW comes from its capacity to provide unseen knowledge about emergent data, which appears every day. Therefore, we suggest performing the topic-modelling technique over the source text to provide a necessary context before translation. Instead of applying the topic-modeling over the entire text, we would follow the principle of communication (i.e from 3 to 5 sentences for describing an idea and define a context for each piece of text. Thus, at the execution of a translation model in a given SMT, we would focus on every word which may be a homonymous or polysemous word. For every word which has more than one translation, a SPARQL query would be required to find the best combination in the current context. Thus, at the translation phase, the disambiguation algorithm could search for an appropriate word using different SW resources such as DBpedia, in consideration of the context provided by the topic modelling. The goal is to exploit the use of more than one SW resource at once for improving the translation of ambiguous terms. The use of two or more SW resources simultaneously has not yet been investigated.\nOn the other hand, there is also a syntactic disambiguation problem which as yet lacks good solutions. For instance, the English language contains irregular verbs like \u201cset\u201d or \u201cput\u201d. Depending on the structure of a sentence, it is not possible to recognize their verbal tense, e.g., present or past tense. Even statistical approaches trained on huge corpora may fail to find the exact meaning of some words due to the structure of the language. Although this challenge has successfully been dealt with since NMT has been used for European languages, implementations of NMT for some non-European languages have not been fully exploited (e.g., Brazilian Portuguese, Latin-America Spanish, Zulu, Hindi) due to the lack of large bilingual data sets on the Web to be trained on. Thus, we suggest gathering relationships among properties within an ontology by using the reasoning technique for handling this issue. For instance, the sentence \u201cAnna usually put her notebook on the table for studying\" may be annotated using a certain vocabulary and represented by triples. Thus, the verb \u201cput\", which is represented by a predicate that groups essential information about the verbal tense, may support the generation step of a given MT system. This sentence usually fails when translated to rich morphological languages, such as Brazilian-Portuguese and Arabic, for which the verb influences the translation of \u201cusually\" to the past tense. In this case, a reasoning technique may support the problem of finding a certain rule behind relationships between source and target texts in the alignment phase (training phase). However, a well-known problem of reasoners is the poor run-time performance. Therefore, this run-time deficiency needs to be addressed or minimized before implementing reasoners successfully into MT systems.\nNamed Entities. Most NERD approaches link recognized entities with database entries or websites. This method helps to categorize and summarize text, but also contributes to the disambiguation of words in texts. The primary issue in MT systems is caused by common words from a source language that are used as proper nouns in a target language. For instance, the word \u201cKiwi\" is a family name in New Zealand which comes from the M\u0101ori culture, but it also can be a fruit, a bird, or a computer program. Named Entities are a common and difficult problem in both MT (see Koehn BIBREF0 ) and SW fields. The SW achieved important advances in NERD using structured data and semantic annotations, e.g., by adding an rdf:type statement which identifies whether a certain kiwi is a fruit BIBREF14 . In MT systems, however, this problem is directly related to the ambiguity problem and therefore has to be resolved in that wider context.\nAlthough MT systems include good recognition methods, they still need improvement. When an MT system does not recognize an entity, the translation output often has poor quality, immediately deteriorating the target text readability. Therefore, we suggest recognizing such entities before the translation process and first linking them to a reference knowledge base. Afterwards, the type of entities would be agglutinated along with their labels and their translations from a reference knowledge base. For instance, in NMT, the idea is to include in the training set for the aforementioned word \u201cKiwi\", \u201cKiwi.animal.link, Kiwi.person.link, Kiwi.food.link\" then finally to align them with the translations in the target text. For example, in SMT, the additional information can be included by XML or by an additional model. In contrast, in NMT, this additional information can be used as parameters in the training phase. This method would also contribute to OOV mistakes regarding names. This idea is supported by BIBREF11 where the authors encoded the types of entities along with the words to improve the translation of sentences between Chinese-English. Recently, Moussallem et al. BIBREF15 have shown promising results by applying a multilingual entity linking algorithm along with knowledge graph embeddings into the translation phase of a neural machine translation model for improving the translation of entities in texts. Their approach achieved significant and consistent improvements of +3 BLEU, METEOR and CHRF3 on average on the newstest datasets between 2014 and 2018 for WMT English-German translation task.\nNon-standard speech. The non-standard language problem is a rather important one in the MT field. Many people use the colloquial form to speak and write to each other on social networks. Thus, when MT systems are applied on this context, the input text frequently contains slang, MWE, and unreasonable abbreviations such as \u201cIdr = I don't remember.\u201d and \u201ccya = see you\u201d. Additionally, idioms contribute to this problem, decreasing the translation quality. Idioms often have an entirely different meaning than their separated word meanings. Consequently, most translation outputs of such expressions contain errors. For a good translation, the MT system needs to recognize such slang and try to map it to the target language. Some SMT systems like Google or Bing have recognition patterns over non-standard speech from old translations through the Web using SMT approaches. In rare cases SMT can solve this problem, but considering that new idiomatic expressions appear every day and most of them are isolated sentences, this challenge still remains open. Moreover, each person has their own speaking form.\nTherefore, we suggest that user characteristics can be applied as context for solving the non-standard language problem. These characteristics can be extracted from social media or user logs and stored as user properties using SWT, e.g., FOAF vocabulary. These ontologies have properties which would help identify the birth place or the interests of a given user. For instance, the properties foaf:interest and sioc:topic can be used to describe a given person's topics of interest. If the person is a computer scientist and the model contains topics such as \u201cInformation Technology\" and \u201cSports\", the SPARQL queries would search for terms inserted in this context which are ambiguous. Furthermore, the property foaf:based_near may support the problem of idioms. Assuming that a user is located in a certain part of Russia and he is reading an English web page which contains some idioms, this property may be used to gather appropriate translations of idioms from English to Russian using a given RDF KB. Therefore, an MT system can be adapted to a user by using specific data about him in RDF along with given KBs. Recently, Moussallem et al BIBREF16 have released a multilingual linked idioms dataset as a first part of supporting the investigation of this suggestion. The dataset contains idioms in 5 languages and are represented by knowledge graphs which facilitates the retrieval and inference of translations among the idioms.\nTranslating KBs. According to our research, it is clear that SWT may be used for translating KBs in order to be applied in MT systems. For instance, some content provided by the German Wikipedia version are not contained in the Portuguese one. Therefore, the semantic structure (i.e., triples) provided by DBpedia versions of these respective Wikipedia versions would be able to help translate from German to Portuguese. For example, the terms contained in triples would be translated to a given target language using a dictionary containing domain words. This dictionary may be acquired in two different ways. First, by performing localisation, as in the work by J. P. McCrae BIBREF17 which translates the terms contained in a monolingual ontology, thus generating a bilingual ontology. Second, by creating embeddings of both DBpedia versions in order to determine the similarity between entities through their vectors. This insight is supported by some recent works, such as Ristoski et al. BIBREF18 , which creates bilingual embeddings using RDF based on Word2vec algorithms. Therefore, we suggest investigating an MT approach mainly based on SWT using NN for translating KBs. Once the KBs are translated, we suggest including them in the language models for improving the translation of entities.\nBesides C. Shi et al BIBREF11 , Ar\u010dan and Buitelaar BIBREF19 presented an approach to translate domain-specific expressions represented by English KBs in order to make the knowledge accessible for other languages. They claimed that KBs are mostly in English, therefore they cannot contribute to the problem of MT to other languages. Thus, they translated two KBs belonging to medical and financial domains, along with the English Wikipedia, to German. Once translated, the KBs were used as external resources in the translation of German-English. The results were quite appealing and the further research into this area should be undertaken. Recently, Moussallem et al BIBREF20 created THOTH, an approach which translates and enriches knowledge graphs across languages. Their approach relies on two different recurrent neural network models along with knowledge graph embeddings. The authors applied their approach on the German DBpedia with the German translation of the English DBpedia on two tasks: fact checking and entity linking. THOTH showed promising results with a translation accuracy of 88.56 while being capable of improving two NLP tasks with its enriched-German KG .\nIn this extended abstract, we detailed the results of a systematic literature review of MT using SWT for improving the translation of natural language sentences. Our goal was to present the current open MT translation problems and how SWT can address these problems and enhance MT quality. Considering the decision power of SWT, they cannot be ignored by future MT systems. As a next step, we intend to continue elaborating a novel MT approach which is capable of simultaneously gathering knowledge from different SW resources and consequently being able to address the ambiguity of named entities and also contribute to the OOV words problem. This insight relies on our recent works, such as BIBREF15 , which have augmented NMT models with the usage of external knowledge for improving the translation of entities in texts. Additionally, future works that can be expected from fellow researchers, include the creation of multilingual linguistic ontologies describing the syntax of rich morphologically languages for supporting MT approaches. Also, the creation of more RDF multilingual dictionaries which can improve some MT steps, such as alignment.\nThis work was supported by the German Federal Ministry of Transport and Digital Infrastructure (BMVI) in the projects LIMBO (no. 19F2029I) and OPAL (no. 19F2028A) as well as by the Brazilian National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) (no. 206971/2014-1)", "question": "What are the opportunities presented by the use of Semantic Web technologies in Machine Translation?", "expected_output": "disambiguation.

Second, it facilitates the use of structured data from social networks, such as Twitter, which can provide valuable context and relationships between sentences. Finally, it enables the use of non-standard speech in MT, which can improve the translation of rare or polysemous words and phrases.\n\nQuestion: What are the"}

This mapping results in a semantic embedding model containing KB triples, which are responsible for gathering the key information of each word in the sentences.\nThe most problematic unresolved MT challenges, from our point of view, which are still experienced by the aforementioned MT approaches are the following:\nAdditionally, there are five MT open challenges posed by Lopez and Post BIBREF12 which we describe more generically below.\n(1) Excessive focus on English and European languages as one of the involved languages in MT approaches and poor research on low-resource language pairs such as African and/or South American languages. (2) The limitations of SMT approaches for translating across domains. Most MT systems exhibit good performance on law and the legislative domains due to the large amount of data provided by the European Union. In contrast, translations performed on sports and life-hacks commonly fail, because of the lack of training data. (3) How to translate the huge amount of data from social networks that uniquely deal with no-standard speech texts from users (e.g., tweets). (4) The difficult translations among morphologically rich languages. This challenge shares the same problem with the first one, namely that most research work focuses on English as one of the involved languages. Therefore, MT systems which translate content between, for instance, Arabic and Spanish are rare. (5) For the speech translation task, the parallel data for training differs widely from real user speech.\nThe challenges above are clearly not independent, which means that addressing one of them can have an impact on the others. Since NMT has shown impressive results on reordering, the main problem turns out to be the disambiguation process (both syntactically and semantically) in SMT approaches BIBREF0 .\nBased on the surveyed works on our research BIBREF6 , SWT have mostly been applied at the semantic analysis step, rather than at the other stages of the translation process, due to their ability to deal with concepts behind the words and provide knowledge about them. As SWT have developed, they have increasingly been able to resolve some of the open challenges of MT. They may be applied in different ways according to each MT approach.\nDisambiguation. Human language is very ambiguous. Most words have multiple interpretations depending on the context in which they are mentioned. In the MT field, WSD techniques are concerned with finding the respective meaning and correct translation to these ambiguous words in target languages. This ambiguity problem was identified early in MT development. In 1960 Bar-Hillel BIBREF1 stated that an MT system is not able to find the right meaning without a specific knowledge. Although the ambiguity problem has been lessened significantly since the contribution of Carpuat and subsequent works BIBREF13 , this problem still remains a challenge. As seen in Moussallem et al. BIBREF6 , MT systems still try to resolve this problem by using domain specific language models to prefer domain specific expressions, but when translating a highly ambiguous sentence or a short text which covers multiple domains, the languages models are not enough.\nSW has already shown its capability for semantic disambiguation of polysemous and homonymous words. However, SWT were applied in two ways to support the semantic disambiguation in MT. First, the ambiguous words were recognized in the source text before carrying out the translation, applying a pre-editing technique. Second, SWT were applied to the output translation in the target language as a post-editing technique. Although applying one of these techniques has increased the quality of a translation, both techniques are tedious to implement when they have to translate common words instead of named entities, then be applied several times to achieve a successful translation.\nThe real benefit of SW comes from its capacity to provide unseen knowledge about emergent data, which appears every day. Therefore, we suggest performing the topic-modelling technique over the source text to provide a necessary context before translation. Instead of applying the topic-modeling over the entire text, we would follow the principle of communication (i.e from 3 to 5 sentences for describing an idea and define a context for each piece of text. Thus, at the execution of a translation model in a given SMT, we would focus on every word which may be a homonymous or polysemous word. For every word which has more than one translation, a SPARQL query would be required to find the best combination in the current context. Thus, at the translation phase, the disambiguation algorithm could search for an appropriate word using different SW resources such as DBpedia, in consideration of the context provided by the topic modelling. The goal is to exploit the use of more than one SW resource at once for improving the translation of ambiguous terms. The use of two or more SW resources simultaneously has not yet been investigated.\nOn the other hand, there is also a syntactic disambiguation problem which as yet lacks good solutions. For instance, the English language contains irregular verbs like \u201cset\u201d or \u201cput\u201d. Depending on the structure of a sentence, it is not possible to recognize their verbal tense, e.g., present or past tense. Even statistical approaches trained on huge corpora may fail to find the exact meaning of some words due to the structure of the language. Although this challenge has successfully been dealt with since NMT has been used for European languages, implementations of NMT for some non-European languages have not been fully exploited (e.g., Brazilian Portuguese, Latin-America Spanish, Zulu, Hindi) due to the lack of large bilingual data sets on the Web to be trained on. Thus, we suggest gathering relationships among properties within an ontology by using the reasoning technique for handling this issue. For instance, the sentence \u201cAnna usually put her notebook on the table for studying\" may be annotated using a certain vocabulary and represented by triples. Thus, the verb \u201cput\", which is represented by a predicate that groups essential information about the verbal tense, may support the generation step of a given MT system. This sentence usually fails when translated to rich morphological languages, such as Brazilian-Portuguese and Arabic, for which the verb influences the translation of \u201cusually\" to the past tense. In this case, a reasoning technique may support the problem of finding a certain rule behind relationships between source and target texts in the alignment phase (training phase). However, a well-known problem of reasoners is the poor run-time performance. Therefore, this run-time deficiency needs to be addressed or minimized before implementing reasoners successfully into MT systems.\nNamed Entities. Most NERD approaches link recognized entities with database entries or websites. This method helps to categorize and summarize text, but also contributes to the disambiguation of words in texts. The primary issue in MT systems is caused by common words from a source language that are used as proper nouns in a target language. For instance, the word \u201cKiwi\" is a family name in New Zealand which comes from the M\u0101ori culture, but it also can be a fruit, a bird, or a computer program. Named Entities are a common and difficult problem in both MT (see Koehn BIBREF0 ) and SW fields. The SW achieved important advances in NERD using structured data and semantic annotations, e.g., by adding an rdf:type statement which identifies whether a certain kiwi is a fruit BIBREF14 . In MT systems, however, this problem is directly related to the ambiguity problem and therefore has to be resolved in that wider context.\nAlthough MT systems include good recognition methods, they still need improvement. When an MT system does not recognize an entity, the translation output often has poor quality, immediately deteriorating the target text readability. Therefore, we suggest recognizing such entities before the translation process and first linking them to a reference knowledge base. Afterwards, the type of entities would be agglutinated along with their labels and their translations from a reference knowledge base. For instance, in NMT, the idea is to include in the training set for the aforementioned word \u201cKiwi\", \u201cKiwi.animal.link, Kiwi.person.link, Kiwi.food.link\" then finally to align them with the translations in the target text. For example, in SMT, the additional information can be included by XML or by an additional model. In contrast, in NMT, this additional information can be used as parameters in the training phase. This method would also contribute to OOV mistakes regarding names. This idea is supported by BIBREF11 where the authors encoded the types of entities along with the words to improve the translation of sentences between Chinese-English. Recently, Moussallem et al. BIBREF15 have shown promising results by applying a multilingual entity linking algorithm along with knowledge graph embeddings into the translation phase of a neural machine translation model for improving the translation of entities in texts. Their approach achieved significant and consistent improvements of +3 BLEU, METEOR and CHRF3 on average on the newstest datasets between 2014 and 2018 for WMT English-German translation task.\nNon-standard speech. The non-standard language problem is a rather important one in the MT field. Many people use the colloquial form to speak and write to each other on social networks. Thus, when MT systems are applied on this context, the input text frequently contains slang, MWE, and unreasonable abbreviations such as \u201cIdr = I don't remember.\u201d and \u201ccya = see you\u201d. Additionally, idioms contribute to this problem, decreasing the translation quality. Idioms often have an entirely different meaning than their separated word meanings. Consequently, most translation outputs of such expressions contain errors. For a good translation, the MT system needs to recognize such slang and try to map it to the target language. Some SMT systems like Google or Bing have recognition patterns over non-standard speech from old translations through the Web using SMT approaches. In rare cases SMT can solve this problem, but considering that new idiomatic expressions appear every day and most of them are isolated sentences, this challenge still remains open. Moreover, each person has their own speaking form.\nTherefore, we suggest that user characteristics can be applied as context for solving the non-standard language problem. These characteristics can be extracted from social media or user logs and stored as user properties using SWT, e.g., FOAF vocabulary. These ontologies have properties which would help identify the birth place or the interests of a given user. For instance, the properties foaf:interest and sioc:topic can be used to describe a given person's topics of interest. If the person is a computer scientist and the model contains topics such as \u201cInformation Technology\" and \u201cSports\", the SPARQL queries would search for terms inserted in this context which are ambiguous. Furthermore, the property foaf:based_near may support the problem of idioms. Assuming that a user is located in a certain part of Russia and he is reading an English web page which contains some idioms, this property may be used to gather appropriate translations of idioms from English to Russian using a given RDF KB. Therefore, an MT system can be adapted to a user by using specific data about him in RDF along with given KBs. Recently, Moussallem et al BIBREF16 have released a multilingual linked idioms dataset as a first part of supporting the investigation of this suggestion. The dataset contains idioms in 5 languages and are represented by knowledge graphs which facilitates the retrieval and inference of translations among the idioms.\nTranslating KBs. According to our research, it is clear that SWT may be used for translating KBs in order to be applied in MT systems. For instance, some content provided by the German Wikipedia version are not contained in the Portuguese one. Therefore, the semantic structure (i.e., triples) provided by DBpedia versions of these respective Wikipedia versions would be able to help translate from German to Portuguese. For example, the terms contained in triples would be translated to a given target language using a dictionary containing domain words. This dictionary may be acquired in two different ways. First, by performing localisation, as in the work by J. P. McCrae BIBREF17 which translates the terms contained in a monolingual ontology, thus generating a bilingual ontology. Second, by creating embeddings of both DBpedia versions in order to determine the similarity between entities through their vectors. This insight is supported by some recent works, such as Ristoski et al. BIBREF18 , which creates bilingual embeddings using RDF based on Word2vec algorithms. Therefore, we suggest investigating an MT approach mainly based on SWT using NN for translating KBs. Once the KBs are translated, we suggest including them in the language models for improving the translation of entities.\nBesides C. Shi et al BIBREF11 , Ar\u010dan and Buitelaar BIBREF19 presented an approach to translate domain-specific expressions represented by English KBs in order to make the knowledge accessible for other languages. They claimed that KBs are mostly in English, therefore they cannot contribute to the problem of MT to other languages. Thus, they translated two KBs belonging to medical and financial domains, along with the English Wikipedia, to German. Once translated, the KBs were used as external resources in the translation of German-English. The results were quite appealing and the further research into this area should be undertaken. Recently, Moussallem et al BIBREF20 created THOTH, an approach which translates and enriches knowledge graphs across languages. Their approach relies on two different recurrent neural network models along with knowledge graph embeddings. The authors applied their approach on the German DBpedia with the German translation of the English DBpedia on two tasks: fact checking and entity linking. THOTH showed promising results with a translation accuracy of 88.56 while being capable of improving two NLP tasks with its enriched-German KG .\nIn this extended abstract, we detailed the results of a systematic literature review of MT using SWT for improving the translation of natural language sentences. Our goal was to present the current open MT translation problems and how SWT can address these problems and enhance MT quality. Considering the decision power of SWT, they cannot be ignored by future MT systems. As a next step, we intend to continue elaborating a novel MT approach which is capable of simultaneously gathering knowledge from different SW resources and consequently being able to address the ambiguity of named entities and also contribute to the OOV words problem. This insight relies on our recent works, such as BIBREF15 , which have augmented NMT models with the usage of external knowledge for improving the translation of entities in texts. Additionally, future works that can be expected from fellow researchers, include the creation of multilingual linguistic ontologies describing the syntax of rich morphologically languages for supporting MT approaches. Also, the creation of more RDF multilingual dictionaries which can improve some MT steps, such as alignment.\nThis work was supported by the German Federal Ministry of Transport and Digital Infrastructure (BMVI) in the projects LIMBO (no. 19F2029I) and OPAL (no. 19F2028A) as well as by the Brazilian National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) (no. 206971/2014-1)", "question": "What are the challenges associated with the use of Semantic Web technologies in Machine Translation?", "expected_output": "syntactic disambiguation problem which as yet lacks good solutions.

However, the RDF specification is not universally agreed upon and there is a significant amount of variation in the implementation of the specification.

{"id": "1907.10676", "prompt": "Alongside increasing globalization comes a greater need for readers to understand texts in languages foreign to them. For example, approximately 48% of the pages on the Web are not available in English. The technological progress of recent decades has made both the distribution and access to content in different languages ever simpler. Translation aims to support users who need to access content in a language in which they are not fluent BIBREF0 .\nHowever, translation is a difficult task due to the complexity of natural languages and their structure BIBREF0 . In addition, manual translation does not scale to the magnitude of the Web. One remedy for this problem is MT. The main goal of MT is to enable people to assess content in languages other than the languages in which they are fluent BIBREF1 . From a formal point of view, this means that the goal of MT is to transfer the semantics of text from an input language to an output language BIBREF2 .\nAlthough MT systems are now popular on the Web, they still generate a large number of incorrect translations. Recently, Popovi\u0107 BIBREF3 has classified five types of errors that still remain in MT systems. According to research, the two main faults that are responsible for 40% and 30% of problems respectively, are reordering errors and lexical and syntactic ambiguity. Thus, addressing these barriers is a key challenge for modern translation systems. A large number of MT approaches have been developed over the years that could potentially serve as a remedy. For instance, translators began by using methodologies based on linguistics which led to the family of RBMT. However, RBMT systems have a critical drawback in their reliance on manually crafted rules, thus making the development of new translation modules for different languages even more difficult.\nSMT and EBMT were developed to deal with the scalability issue in RBMT BIBREF4 , a necessary characteristic of MT systems that must deal with data at Web scale. Presently, these approaches have begun to address the drawbacks of rule-based approaches. However, some problems that had already been solved for linguistics based methods reappeared. The majority of these problems are connected to the issue of ambiguity, including syntactic and semantic variations BIBREF0 . Nowadays, a novel SMT paradigm has arisen called NMT which relies on NN algorithms. NMT has been achieving impressive results and is now the state-of-the-art in MT approaches. However, NMT is still a statistical approach sharing some semantic drawbacks from other well-defined SMT approaches BIBREF5 .\nOne possible solution to address the remaining issues of MT lies in the use of SWT, which have emerged over recent decades as a paradigm to make the semantics of content explicit so that it can be used by machines. It is believed that explicit semantic knowledge made available through these technologies can empower MT systems to supply translations with significantly better quality while remaining scalable. In particular, the disambiguated knowledge about real-world entities, their properties and their relationships made available on the LD Web can potentially be used to infer the right meaning of ambiguous sentences or words.\nAccording to our survey BIBREF6 , the obvious opportunity of using SWT for MT has already been studied by a number of approaches, especially w.r.t. the issue of ambiguity. In this paper, we present the challenges and opportunities in the use of SWT in MT for translating texts.\nThe idea of using a structured KB in MT systems started in the 90s with the work of Knight and Luk BIBREF7 . Still, only a few researchers have designed different strategies for benefiting of structured knowledge in MT architectures BIBREF8 . Recently, the idea of using KG into MT systems has gained renewed attention. Du et al. BIBREF9 created an approach to address the problem of OOV words by using BabelNet BIBREF10 . Their approach applies different methods of using BabelNet. In summary, they create additional training data and apply a post-editing technique, which replaces the OOV words while querying BabelNet. Shi et al. BIBREF11 have recently built a semantic embedding model reliant upon a specific KB to be used in NMT systems. The model relies on semantic embeddings to encode the key information contained in words to translate the meaning of sentences correctly. The work consists of mapping a source sentence to triples, which are then used to extract the intrinsic meaning of words to generate a target sentence. This mapping results in a semantic embedding model containing KB triples, which are responsible for gathering the key information of each word in the sentences.\nThe most problematic unresolved MT challenges, from our point of view, which are still experienced by the aforementioned MT approaches are the following:\nAdditionally, there are five MT open challenges posed by Lopez and Post BIBREF12 which we describe more generically below.\n(1) Excessive focus on English and European languages as one of the involved languages in MT approaches and poor research on low-resource language pairs such as African and/or South American languages.

(5) For the speech translation task, the parallel data for training differs widely from real user speech.", "generated_answer": "The other obstacles to automatic translations which are not mentioned in the abstract are the following:\nNon-standard language problem: Many people use the colloquial form to speak and write to each other on social networks. Thus, when MT systems are applied on this context, the input text frequently contains slang, MWE, and unreasonable abbreviations such as \u201cIdr = I don't remember.\" and \u201ccya = see you\". Additionally, idioms contribute to this problem, decreasing the translation quality.\nNon-standard speech: The non-standard language problem is a rather important one in the MT field. Many people use the colloquial form to speak"}
{"id": "1906.08871", "prompt": "Electroencephalography (EEG) is a non invasive way of measuring electrical activity of human brain. In BIBREF0 we demonstrated deep learning based automatic speech recognition (ASR) using EEG signals for a limited English vocabulary of four words and five vowels. In this paper we extend our work for a much larger English vocabulary and we use state-of-art end-to-end continuous speech recognition models to perform recognition. In our prior work we predicted isolated words and vowels.\nASR systems forms the front end or back end in many cutting edge voice activated technologies like Amazon Alexa, Apple Siri, Windows Cortana, Samsung Bixby etc. Unfortunately these systems are trained to recognize text only from acoustic features. This limits technology accessibility to people with speaking disabilities and disorders. The research work presented in this paper tries to address this issue by investigating speech recognition using only EEG signals with no acoustic input and also by combining EEG features along with traditional acoustic features to perform recognition. We believe the former will help with speech restoration for people who can not speak at all and the latter will help people who are having speaking disabilities like broken or discontinued speech etc to use voice activated technologies with better user experience there by helping in improving technology accessibility.\nASR performance is degraded in presence of noisy speech and in real life situations most of the speech is noisy. Inspired from the unique robustness to environmental artifacts exhibited by the human auditory cortex BIBREF1 , BIBREF2 we used very noisy speech data for this work and demonstrated lower word error rate (WER) for smaller corpus using EEG features, concatenation of EEG features and acoustic features.\nIn BIBREF3 authors decode imagined speech from EEG using synthetic EEG data and connectionist temporal classification (CTC) network but in our work we use real EEG data, use EEG data recorded along with acoustics. In BIBREF4 authors perform envisioned speech recognition using random forest classifier but in our case we use end to end state of art models and perform recognition for noisy speech. In BIBREF5 authors demonstrate speech recognition using electrocorticography (ECoG) signals, which are invasive in nature but in our work we use non invasive EEG signals.\nThis work is mainly motivated by the results explained in BIBREF0 , BIBREF6 , BIBREF7 , BIBREF3 . In BIBREF6 the authors used classification approach for identifying phonological categories in imagined and silent speech but in our work we used continuous speech recognition state of art models and our models were predicting words, characters at each time step. Similarly in BIBREF7 neural network based classification approach was used for predicting phonemes.\nMajor contribution of this paper is the demonstration of end to end continuous noisy speech recognition using only EEG features and this paper further validates the concepts introduced in BIBREF0 for a much larger English corpus.\nAn end-to-end ASR model maps input feature vectors to an output sequence of vectors of posterior probabilities of tokens without using separate acoustic model, pronunciation model and language model. In this work we implemented two different types of state of art end to end ASR models used for the task of continuous speech recognition and the input feature vectors can be EEG features or concatenation of acoustic and EEG features. We used Google's tensorflow and keras deep learning libraries for building our ASR models.\nThe main ideas behind CTC based ASR were first introduced in the following papers BIBREF8 , BIBREF9 . In our work we used a single layer gated recurrent unit (GRU) BIBREF10 with 128 hidden units as encoder for the CTC network. The decoder consists of a combination of a dense layer ( fully connected layer) and a softmax activation. Output at every time step of the GRU layer is fed into the decoder network. The number of time steps of the GRU encoder is equal to product of the sampling frequency of the input features and the length of the input sequence. Since different speakers have different rate of speech, we used dynamic recurrent neural network (RNN) cell. There is no fixed value for time steps of the encoder.\nUsually the number of time steps of the encoder (T) is greater than the length of output tokens for a continuous speech recognition problem. A RNN based CTC network tries to make length of output tokens equal to T by allowing the repetition of output prediction unit tokens and by introducing a special token called blank token BIBREF8 across all the frames. We used CTC loss function with adam optimizer BIBREF11 and during inference time we used CTC beam search decoder.\nWe now explain the loss function used in our CTC model. Consider training data set INLINEFORM0 with training examples INLINEFORM1 and the corresponding label set INLINEFORM2 with target vectors INLINEFORM3 . Consider any training example, label pair ( INLINEFORM4 , INLINEFORM5 ). Let the number of time steps of the RNN encoder for ( INLINEFORM6 , INLINEFORM7 ) is INLINEFORM8 . In case of character based CTC model, the RNN predicts a character at every time step. Whereas in word based CTC model, the RNN predicts a word at every time step. For the sake of simplicity, let us assume that length of target vector INLINEFORM9 is equal to INLINEFORM10 . Let the probability vector output by the RNN at each time step INLINEFORM11 be INLINEFORM12 and let INLINEFORM13 value of INLINEFORM14 be denoted by INLINEFORM15 . The probability that model outputs INLINEFORM16 on input INLINEFORM17 is given by INLINEFORM18 . During the training phase, we would like to maximize the conditional probability INLINEFORM19 , and thereby define the loss function as INLINEFORM20 .\nIn case when the length of INLINEFORM0 is less than INLINEFORM1 , we extend the target vector INLINEFORM2 by repeating a few of its values and by introducing blank token ( INLINEFORM3 ) to create a target vector of length INLINEFORM4 . Let the possible extensions of INLINEFORM5 be denoted by INLINEFORM6 . For example, when INLINEFORM7 and INLINEFORM8 , the possible extensions are INLINEFORM9 , INLINEFORM10 , INLINEFORM11 , INLINEFORM12 , INLINEFORM13 , INLINEFORM14 and INLINEFORM15 . We then define INLINEFORM16 as INLINEFORM17 .\nIn our work we used character based CTC ASR model. CTC assumes the conditional independence constraint that output predictions are independent given the entire input sequence.\nRNN encoder - decoder ASR model consists of a RNN encoder and a RNN decoder with attention mechanism BIBREF12 , BIBREF13 , BIBREF14 . The number of time steps of the encoder is equal to the product of sampling frequency of the input features and the length of input sequence. There is no fixed value for time steps in our case. We used dynamic RNN cell. We used a single layer GRU with 128 hidden units for both encoder and decoder. A dense layer followed by softmax activation is used after the decoder GRU to get the prediction probabilities. Dense layer performs an affine transformation. The number of time steps of the decoder GRU is same as the number of words present in the sentence for a given training example. Training objective is to maximize the log probability of the ordered conditionals, ie: INLINEFORM0 , where X is input feature vector, INLINEFORM1 's are the labels for the ordered words present in that training example and INLINEFORM2 is the length of the output label sentence for that example. Cross entropy was used as the loss function with adam as the optimizer. We used teacher forcing algorithm BIBREF15 to train the model. During inference time we used beam search decoder.\nWe now explain the attention mechanism used in our attention model. Consider any training example, label pair ( INLINEFORM0 , INLINEFORM1 ). Let the number of times steps of encoder GRU for that example be INLINEFORM2 . The GRU encoder will transform the input features ( INLINEFORM3 ) into hidden output feature vectors ( INLINEFORM4 ). Let INLINEFORM5 word label in INLINEFORM6 (sentence) be INLINEFORM7 , then to predict INLINEFORM8 at decoder time step INLINEFORM9 , context vector INLINEFORM10 is computed and fed into the decoder GRU. INLINEFORM11 is computed as INLINEFORM12 , where INLINEFORM13 is the attention weight vector satisfying the property INLINEFORM14 .\n INLINEFORM0 can be intuitively seen as a measure of how much attention INLINEFORM1 must pay to INLINEFORM2 , INLINEFORM3 . INLINEFORM4 is mathematically defined as INLINEFORM5 , where INLINEFORM6 is hidden state of the decoder GRU at time step INLINEFORM7 .\nThe way of computing value for INLINEFORM0 depends on the type of attention used. In this work, we used bahdanau's additive style attention BIBREF13 , which defines INLINEFORM1 as INLINEFORM2 ) where INLINEFORM3 and INLINEFORM4 are learnable parameters during training of the model.\nWe built two types of simultaneous speech EEG recording databases for this work. For database A five female and five male subjects took part in the experiment. For database B five male and three female subjects took part in the experiment. Except two subjects, rest all were native English speakers for both the databases. All subjects were UT Austin undergraduate,graduate students in their early twenties.\nFor data set A, the 10 subjects were asked to speak the first 30 sentences from the USC-TIMIT database BIBREF16 and their simultaneous speech and EEG signals were recorded. This data was recorded in presence of background noise of 40 dB (noise generated by room air conditioner fan). We then asked each subject to repeat the same experiment two more times, thus we had 30 speech EEG recording examples for each sentence.\nFor data set B, the 8 subjects were asked to repeat the same previous experiment but this time we used background music played from our lab computer to generate a background noise of 65 dB. Here we had 24 speech EEG recording examples for each sentence.\nWe used Brain Vision EEG recording hardware. Our EEG cap had 32 wet EEG electrodes including one electrode as ground as shown in Figure 1. We used EEGLab BIBREF17 to obtain the EEG sensor location mapping. It is based on standard 10-20 EEG sensor placement method for 32 electrodes.\nFor data set A, we used data from first 8 subjects for training the model, remaining two subjects data for validation and test set respectively.\nFor data set B, we used data from first 6 subjects for training the model, remaining two subjects data for validation and test set respectively.\nEEG signals were sampled at 1000Hz and a fourth order IIR band pass filter with cut off frequencies 0.1Hz and 70Hz was applied. A notch filter with cut off frequency 60 Hz was used to remove the power line noise. EEGlab's BIBREF17 Independent component analysis (ICA) toolbox was used to remove other biological signal artifacts like electrocardiography (ECG), electromyography (EMG), electrooculography (EOG) etc from the EEG signals. We extracted five statistical features for EEG, namely root mean square, zero crossing rate,moving window average,kurtosis and power spectral entropy BIBREF0 . So in total we extracted 31(channels) X 5 or 155 features for EEG signals.The EEG features were extracted at a sampling frequency of 100Hz for each EEG channel.\nWe used spectral entropy because it captures the spectral ( frequency domain) and signal complexity information of EEG. It is also a widely used feature in EEG signal analysis BIBREF18 . Similarly zero crossing rate was chosen as it is a commonly used feature both for speech recognition and bio signal analysis. Remaining features were chosen to capture time domain statistical information. We performed lot of experiments to identify this set of features. Initially we used only spectral entropy and zero crossing rate but we noticed that the performance of the ASR system significantly went up by 20 % when we added the remaining additional features.\nThe recorded speech signal was sampled at 16KHz frequency. We extracted Mel-frequency cepstrum (MFCC) as features for speech signal. We first extracted MFCC 13 features and then computed first and second order differentials (delta and delta-delta) thus having total MFCC 39 features. The MFCC features were also sampled at 100Hz same as the sampling frequency of EEG features to avoid seq2seq problem.\nAfter extracting EEG and acoustic features as explained in the previous section, we used non linear methods to do feature dimension reduction in order to obtain set of EEG features which are better representation of acoustic features. We reduced the 155 EEG features to a dimension of 30 by applying Kernel Principle Component Analysis (KPCA) BIBREF19 .We plotted cumulative explained variance versus number of components to identify the right feature dimension as shown in Figure 2. We used KPCA with polynomial kernel of degree 3 BIBREF0 . We further computed delta, delta and delta of those 30 EEG features, thus the final feature dimension of EEG was 90 (30 times 3) for both the data sets.\nWhen we used the EEG features for ASR without dimension reduction, the ASR performance went down by 40 %. The non linear dimension reduction of EEG features significantly improved the performance of ASR.\nThe attention model was predicting a word and CTC model was predicting a character at every time step, hence we used word error rate (WER) as performance metric to evaluate attention model and character error rate (CER) for CTC model for different feature sets as shown below.\nTable i@ and ii@ shows the test time results for attention model for both the data sets when trained using EEG features and concatenation of EEG, acoustic features respectively. As seen from the results the attention model gave lower WER when trained and tested on smaller number of sentences. As the vocabulary size increase, the WER also went up. We believe for the attention model to achieve lower WER for larger vocabulary size more number of training examples or larger training data set is required as large number of weights need to be adapted. Figure 3 shows the training loss convergence of our attention model.\nTable iv@ and v@ shows the results obtained using CTC model. The error rates for CTC model also went up with the increase in vocabulary size for both the data sets. However the CTC model was trained for 500 epochs compared to 100 epochs for attention model to observe loss convergence and batch size was set to one for CTC model. Thus CTC model training was lot more time consuming than attention model.\nIn BIBREF0 we have demonstrated that EEG sensors T7 and T8 features contributed most towards ASR performance. Table vi@ shows the CTC model test time results when we trained the model using EEG features from only T7 and T8 sensors on the most noisy data set B. We observed that as vocabulary size increase, error rates were slightly lower than the error rates from Table iv@ where we used EEG features from all 31 sensors with dimension reduction. Table iii@ shows the results for attention model when trained with EEG features from sensors T7 and T8 only on data set B. We observed that error rates were higher in this case compared to the error rates reported in table ii@.\nFigures 4 shows the visualization of the attention weights when the attention model was trained and tested using only EEG features for Data set B. The plots shows the EEG feature importance ( attention) distribution across time steps for predicting first sentence and it indicates that attention model was not able to attend properly to EEG features, which might be another reason for giving higher WER.\nIn this paper we demonstrated the feasibility of using EEG features, concatenation of EEG and acoustic features for performing noisy continuous speech recognition. To our best knowledge this is the first time a continuous noisy speech recognition is demonstrated using only EEG features.\nFor both attention and CTC model we observed that as the vocabulary size increase, concatenating acoustic features with EEG features will help in reducing the test time error rates.\nWe further plan to publish our speech EEG data base used in this work to help advancement of research in this area.\nFor future work, we plan to build a much larger speech EEG data base and also perform experiments with data collected from subjects with speaking disabilities.\nWe will also investigate whether it is possible to improve the attention model results by tuning hyper parameters to improve the model's ability to condition on the input,improve CTC model results by training with more number of examples and by using external language model during inference time.\nWe would like to thank Kerry Loader and Rezwanul Kabir from Dell, Austin, TX for donating us the GPU to train the models used in this work.", "question": "what eeg features were used?", "expected_output": "We extracted five statistical features for EEG, namely root mean square, zero crossing rate,moving window average,kurtosis and power spectral entropy BIBREF0.

To our best knowledge this is the first time a continuous noisy speech recognition is demonstrated using only EEG features.\nFor both attention and CTC model we observed that as the vocabulary size increase, concatenating acoustic features with EEG features will help in reducing the test time error rates.\nWe further plan to publish our speech EEG data base used in this work to help advancement of research in this area.\nFor future work, we plan to build a much larger speech EEG data base and also perform experiments with data collected from subjects with speaking disabilities.\nWe will also investigate whether it is possible to improve the attention model results by tuning hyper parameters to improve the model's ability to condition on the input,improve CTC model results by training with more number of examples and by using external language model during inference time.\nWe would like to thank Kerry Loader and Rezwanul Kabir from Dell, Austin, TX for donating us the GPU to train the models used in this work.", "question": "what dataset was used?", "expected_output": "two types of simultaneous speech EEG recording databases.

{"id": "2004.04124", "prompt": "The pre-trained language model, BERT BIBREF0 has led to a big breakthrough in various kinds of natural language understanding tasks. Ideally, people can start from a pre-trained BERT checkpoint and fine-tune it on a specific downstream task. However, the original BERT models are memory-exhaustive and latency-prohibitive to be served in embedded devices or CPU-based online environments. As the memory and latency constraints vary in different scenarios, the pre-trained BERT model should be adaptive to different requirements with accuracy retained to the largest extent. Existing BERT-oriented model compression solutions largely depend on knowledge distillation BIBREF1, which is inefficient and resource-consuming because a large training corpus is required to learn the behaviors of a teacher. For example, DistilBERT BIBREF2 is re-trained on the same corpus as pre-training a vanilla BERT from scratch; and TinyBERT BIBREF3 utilizes expensive data augmentation to fit the distillation target. The costs of these model compression methods are as large as pre-training and unaffordable for low-resource settings. Therefore, it is straight-forward to ask, can we design a lightweight method to generate adaptive models with comparable accuracy using significantly less time and resource consumption? In this paper, we propose LadaBERT (Lightweight adaptation of BERT through hybrid model compression) to tackle the raised questions. Specifically, LadaBERT is based on an iterative hybrid model compression framework consisting of weighting pruning, matrix factorization and knowledge distillation. Initially, the architecture and weights of student model are inherited from the BERT teacher. In each iteration, the student model is first compressed by a small ratio based on weight pruning and matrix factorization, and is then fine-tuned under the guidance of teacher model through knowledge distillation. Because weight pruning and matrix factorization help to generate better initial and intermediate status\nin the knowledge distillation iterations, the accuracy and efficiency of model compression can be greatly improved.\nWe conduct extensive experiments on five public datasets of natural language understanding. As an example, the performance comparison of LadaBERT and state-of-the-art models on MNLI-m dataset is illustrated in Figure FIGREF1. We can see that LadaBERT outperforms other BERT-oriented model compression baselines at various model compression ratios. Especially, LadaBERT-1 outperforms BERT-PKD significantly under $2.5\\times $ compression ratio, and LadaBERT-3 outperforms TinyBERT under $7.5\\times $ compression ratio while the training speed is accelerated by an order of magnitude.\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows. First, we summarizes the related works of model compression and their applications to BERT in Section SECREF2. Then, the methodology of LadaBERT is introduced in Section SECREF3, and experimental results are presented in Section SECREF4. At last, we conclude this work and discuss future works in Section SECREF5.\nDeep Neural Networks (DNNs) have achieved great success in many areas in recent years, but the memory consumption and computational cost expand greatly with the growing complexity of models. Therefore, model compression has become an indispensable technique for practice, especially in low-resource settings. In this section, we review the current progresses of model compression techniques briefly, which can be divided into four categories, namely weight pruning, matrix factorization, weight quantization and knowledge distillation. We also present hybrid approaches and the applications of model compression to pre-trained BERT models.\nNumerous researches have shown that removing a large portion of connections or neurons does not cause significant performance drop in deep neural network models BIBREF4, BIBREF5, BIBREF6, BIBREF7. For example, Han et al. BIBREF4 proposed a method to reduce the storage and computation of neural networks by removing unimportant connections, resulting in sparse networks without affecting the model accuracy. Li et al. BIBREF5 presented an acceleration method for convolution neural network by pruning whole filters together with their connecting filter maps. This approach does not generate sparse connectivity patterns and brings much larger acceleration ratio with existing BLAS libraries for dense matrix multiplications. Ye et al. BIBREF8 argued that small weights are in fact important for preserving the performance of a model, and Hu et al. BIBREF6 alleviated this problem by a data-driven approach that pruned zero-activation neurons iteratively based on intermediate feature maps. Zhu and Gupta BIBREF7 empirically compared large-sparse models with smaller dense models of similar parameter sizes and found that large sparse models performed better consistently. In addition, sparsity-induced models BIBREF9, BIBREF10, BIBREF11 can be regarded as similar methods as pruning. For example, Wen et al. BIBREF9 applied group lasso as a regularizer at training time, and Louizos et al. BIBREF10 learned sparse neural networks through $l_0$ regularization.\nThe goal of matrix factorization is to decompose a matrix into the product of two matrices in lower dimensions, and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is a popular way of matrix factorization that generalizes the eigendecomposition of a square normal matrix to a $m \\times n$ matrix. It has been proved that SVD is the best approximation of a matrix given the rank $r$ under Frobenius norm BIBREF12. Matrix factorization was widely studied in the deep learning domain for model compression and acceleration BIBREF13, BIBREF14, BIBREF15. Sainath et al BIBREF13 explored a low-rank matrix factorization method of DNN layers for acoustic modeling. Xu et al. BIBREF14, BIBREF15 applied singular value decomposition to deep neural network acoustic models and achieved comparable performances with state-of-the-art models through much fewer parameters. GroupReduce BIBREF16 focused on the compression of neural language models and applied low-rank matrix approximation to vocabulary-partition. Acharya et al. BIBREF17 compressed the word embedding layer via matrix factorization and achieved promising results in text classification. Winata et al. BIBREF18 carried out experiments for low-rank matrix factorization on different NLP tasks and demonstrated that it was more effective in general than weight pruning.\nWeight quantization is a common technique for compressing deep neural networks, which aims to reduce the number of bits to represent every weight in the model. In a neural network, parameters are stacked into clusters, and the parameters in the same cluster share the same value. With weight quantization, the weights can be reduced to at most 1-bit binary value from 32-bits floating point numbers. Zhou et al. BIBREF19 showed that quantizing weights to 8-bits does not hurt the performance, and Binarized Neural Networks BIBREF20 contained binary weights and activations of only one bit. Incremental Network Quantization BIBREF21 converted a pre-trained full-precision neural network into low-precision counterpart through three interdependent operations: weight partition, groupwise quantization and re-training. Variational Network Quantization BIBREF22 formulated the problem of network quantization as a variational inference problem. Moreover, Choi et al. BIBREF23 investigated the drawbacks of conventional quantization methods based on k-means and proposed a Hessian-weighted k-means clustering algorithm as the solution.\nKnowledge distillation is first proposed by BIBREF1, which trains a compact or smaller model to approximate the function learned by a large and complex model. A preliminary step of knowledge distillation is to train a deep network (the teacher model) that automatically generates soft labels for training instances. This \u201csynthetic\" label is then used to train a smaller network (the student model), which assimilates the function that is learned by the teacher model. Chen et al. BIBREF24 successfully applied knowledge distillation to object detection tasks by introducing several modifications, including a weighted cross-entropy loss, a teacher bounded loss, and adaptation layers to model intermediate teacher distributions. Li et al. BIBREF25 developed a framework to learn from noisy labels, where the knowledge learned from a clean dataset and semantic knowledge graph were leveraged to correct the wrong labels. Anil et al. BIBREF26 proposed online distillation, a variant of knowledge distillation which enabled extra parallelism for training large-scale data. In addition, knowledge distillation is also useful for aggregating model ensembles into a single model by treating the ensemble model as a teacher.\nTo improve the performance of model compression, there are many attempts to conduct hybrid model compression method that combines more than one category of algorithms. Han et al. BIBREF27 combined quantization, hamming coding and weight pruning to conduct model compression on image classification tasks. Yu et al. BIBREF28 proposed a unified framework for low-rank and sparse decomposition of weight matrices with feature map reconstructions. Polino et al. BIBREF29 advocated a combination of distillation and quantization techniques and proposed two hybrid models, i.e., quantified distillation and differentiable quantization to address this problem. Li et al., BIBREF30 compressed DNN-based acoustic model through knowledge distillation and pruning. NNCF BIBREF31 provided a neural network compression framework that supported an integration of various model compression methods to generate more lightweight networks and achieved state-of-the-art performances in terms of a trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. In BIBREF32, an AutoML pipeline was adopted for model compression. It leveraged reinforcement learning to search for the best model compression strategy among multiple combinatorial configurations.\nIn the natural language processing community, there is a growing interest recently to study BERT-oriented model compression for shipping its performance gain into latency-critical or low-resource scenarios. Most existing works focus on knowledge distillation. For instance, BERT-PKD BIBREF33 is a patient knowledge distillation approach that compresses the original BERT model into a lightweight shallow network. Different from traditional knowledge distillation methods, BERT-PKD enables an exploitation of rich information in the teacher's hidden layers by utilizing a layer-wise distillation constraint. DistillBERT BIBREF2 pre-trains a smaller general-purpose language model on the same corpus as vanilla BERT. Distilled BiLSTM BIBREF34 adopts a single-layer BiLSTM as the student model and achieves comparable results with ELMo BIBREF35 through much fewer parameters and less inference time. TinyBERT BIBREF3 reports the best-ever performance on BERT model compression, which exploits a novel attention-based distillation schema that encourages the linguistic knowledge in teacher to be well transferred into the student model. It adopts a two-stage learning framework, including general distillation (pre-training from scratch via distillation loss) and task-specific distillation with data augmentation. Both procedures require huge resources and long training times (from several days to weeks), which is cumbersome for industrial applications. Therefore, we are aiming to explore more lightweight solutions in this paper.\nThe overall pipeline of LadaBERT (Lightweight Adaptation of BERT) is illustrated in Figure FIGREF8. As shown in the figure, the pre-trained BERT model (e.g., BERT-Base) is served as the teacher as well as the initial status of the student model. Then, the student model is compressed towards smaller parameter size through a hybrid model compression framework in an iterative manner until the target compression ratio is reached. Concretely, in each iteration, the parameter size of student model is first reduced by $1-\\Delta $ based on weight pruning and matrix factorization, and then the parameters are fine-tuned by the loss function of knowledge distillation. The motivation behind is that matrix factorization and weight pruning are complementary with each other. Matrix factorization calculates the optimal approximation under a certain rank, while weight pruning introduces additional sparsity to the decomposed matrices. Moreover, weight pruning and matrix factorization generates better initial and intermediate status of the student model, which improve the efficiency and effectiveness of knowledge distillation. In the following subsections, we will introduce the algorithms in detail.\nWe use Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) for matrix factorization. Each parameter matrix, including the embedding layer are compressed by SVD. Without loss generality, we assume a matrix of parameters ${W} \\in \\mathbb {R}^{m\\times n}$, the singular value decomposition of which can be written as:\nwhere ${U} \\in \\mathbb {R}^{m \\times p}$ and ${V} \\in \\mathbb {R}^{p \\times n}$. ${\\Sigma } =diag(\\sigma _1,\\sigma _2,\\ldots ,\\sigma _p)$ is a diagonal matrix composed of singular values and $p$ is the full rank of $W$ satisfying $p \\le min(m, n)$.\nTo compress this weight matrix, we select a lower rank $r$. The diagonal matrix ${\\Sigma }$ is truncated by selecting the top $r$ singular values. i.e., ${\\Sigma }_r =diag(\\sigma _1, \\sigma _2,\\ldots ,\\sigma _r)$, while ${U}$ and ${V}$ are also truncated by selecting the top $r$ columns and rows respectively, resulting in ${U}_r \\in \\mathbb {R}^{m\\times r}$ and ${V}_r \\in \\mathbb {R}^{r\\times n}$.\nThus, low-rank matrix approximation of ${W}$ can be formulated as:\nIn this way, the original weight matrix $W$ is decomposed by the multiplication of two smaller matrices, where ${A}={U}_r\\sqrt{{\\Sigma }_r} \\in \\mathbb {R}^{n\\times r}$ and ${B}={V}_r\\sqrt{{\\Sigma }_r} \\in \\mathbb {R}^{m\\times r}$. These two matrices are initialized by SVD and will be further tuned during training.\nGiven a rank $r \\le min(m, n)$, the compression ratio of matrix factorization is defined as:\nTherefore, for a target model compression ratio $P_{svd}$, the desired rank $r$ can be calculated by:\nWeight pruning BIBREF4 is an unstructured compression method that induces desirable sparsity for a neural network model. For a neural network $f({x; \\theta })$ with parameters $\\theta $, weight pruning finds a binary mask ${M} \\in \\lbrace 0, 1\\rbrace ^{|\\theta |}$ subject to a given sparsity ratio, $P_{weight}$. The neural network after pruning will be $f({x; M \\cdot \\theta })$, where the non-zero parameter size is $||{M}||_1 = P_{weight}\\cdot |\\theta |$, where $|\\theta |$ is the number of parameters in $\\theta $. For example, when $P_m = 0.3$, there are 70% zeros and 30% ones in the mask ${m}$. We adopt a simple pruning strategy in our implementation: the binary mask is generated by setting the smallest weights to zeros BIBREF36.\nTo combine the benefits of weight pruning with matrix factorization, we leverage a hybrid approach that applies weight pruning on the basis of decomposed matrices generated by SVD. Following Equation (DISPLAY_FORM12), SVD-based matrix factorization for any weight matrix ${W}$ can be written as: ${W}_{svd}={A}_{m\\times r}{B}_{n\\times r}^T$. Then, weight pruning is applied on the decomposed matrices ${A} \\in \\mathbb {R}^{m \\times r}$ and ${B} \\in \\mathbb {R}^{n \\times r}$ separately. The weight matrix after hybrid compression is denoted by:\nwhere ${M_A}$ and ${M_B}$ are binary masks derived by the weight pruning algorithm with compression ratio $P_{weight}$. The compression ratio of this hybrid approach can be calculated by:\nIn LadaBERT, the hybrid compression produce is applied to each layer of the pre-trained BERT model. Given an overall model compression target $P$, the following constraint should be satisfied:\nwhere $|\\theta |$ is the total number of model parameters and $P$ is the target compression ratio; $|\\theta _{embd}|$ denotes the parameter number of embedding layer, which has a relative compression ratio of $P_embd$, and $|\\theta _{encd}|$ denotes the number of parameters of all layers in BERT encoder, which have a compression ratio of $P_{hybrid}$. The classification layer (often MLP layer with Softmax activation) has a small parameter size ($|\\theta _{cls}|$), so it is not modified in the model compression procedure. In the experiments, these fine-grained compression ratios can be optimized by random search on the validation data.\nKnowledge distillation (KD) has been widely used to transfer knowledge from a large teacher model to a smaller student model. In other words, the student model mimics the behavior of the teacher model by minimize the knowledge distillation loss functions. Various types of knowledge distillation can be employed at different sub-layers. Generally, all types of knowledge distillation can be modeled as minimizing the following loss function:\nWhere $x$ indicates a sample input and $\\mathcal {X}$ is the training dataset. $f^{(s)}({x})$ and $f^{(t)}({x})$ represent intermediate outputs or weight matrices for the student model and teacher model correspondingly. $L(\\cdot )$ represents for a loss function which can be carefully defined for different types of knowledge distillation. We follow the recent technique proposed by TinyBERT BIBREF3, which applies knowledge distillation constraints upon embedding, self-attention, hidden representation and prediction levels. Concretely, there are four types of knowledge distillation constraints as follows:\nEmbedding-layer distillation is performed upon the embedding layer. $f({x}) \\in \\mathbb {R}^{n \\times d}$ represents for the word embedding output for input $x$, where $n$ is the input word length and $d$ is the dimension of word embedding. Mean Squared Error (MSE) is adopted as the loss function $L(\\cdot )$.\nAttention-layer distillation is performed upon the self-attention sub-layer. $f({x}) = \\lbrace a_{ij}\\rbrace \\in \\mathbb {R}^{n \\times n}$ represents the attention output for each self-attention sub-layer, and $L(\\cdot )$ denotes MSE loss function.\nHidden-layer Distillation is performed at each fully-connected sub-layer in the Transformer architectures. $f({x})$ denotes the output representation of the corresponding sub-layer, and $L(\\cdot )$ also adopts MSE loss function.\nPrediction-layer distillation makes the student model to learns the predictions from a teacher model directly. It is identical to the vanilla form of knowledge distillation BIBREF1. It takes the soft cross-entropy loss function, which is formulated as:\nwhere $f^t({x})$ and $f^s({x})$ are the predictive logits of teacher and student models respectively.\nWe compare LadaBERT with state-of-the-art model compression approaches on five public datasets of different tasks of natural language understanding, including sentiment classification (SST-2), natural language inference (MNLI-m, MNLI-mm, QNLI) and pairwise semantic equivalence (QQP). The statistics of these datasets are described in Table TABREF27.\nThe baseline approaches are summarized below.\nWeight pruning and matrix factorization are two simple baselines described in Section SECREF2. We evaluate both pruning methods in an iterative manner until the target compression ratio is reached.\nHybrid pruning is a combination of matrix factorization and weight pruning, which conducts iterative weight pruning on the basis of SVD-based matrix factorization. It is performed iteratively until the desired compression ratio is achieved.\nBERT-FT, BERT-KD and BERT-PKD are reported in BIBREF33, where BERT-FT directly fine-tunes the model via supervision labels, BERT-KD is the vanilla knowledge distillation algorithm BIBREF1, and BERT-PKD stands for Patient Knowledge Distillation proposed in BIBREF33. The student model is composed of 3 Transformer layers, resulting in a $2.5\\times $ compression ratio. Each layer has the same hidden size as the pre-trained teacher, so the initial parameters of student model can be inherited from the corresponding teacher.\nTinyBERT BIBREF3 instantiates a tiny student model, which has totally 14.5M parameters ($7.5\\times $ compression ratio) composed of 4 layers, 312 hidden units, 1200 intermediate size and 12 heads. For a fair comparison, we reproduce the TinyBERT pipeline without general distillation and data augmentation, which is time-exhaustive and resource-consuming.\nBERT-SMALL has the same model architecture as TinyBERT, but is directly pre-trained by the official BERT pipeline. The performance values are inherited from BIBREF3 for reference.\nDistilled-BiLSTM BIBREF34 leverages a single-layer bidirectional-LSTM as the student model, where the hidden units and intermediate size are set to be 300 and 400 respectively, resulting in a $10.8 \\times $ compression ratio. This model requires a expensive pre-training process using the knowledge distillation constraints.\nWe leverage the pre-trained checkpoint of base-bert-uncased as the initial model for compression, which contains 12 layers, 12 heads, 110M parameters, and 768 hidden units per layer. Hyper-parameter selection is conducted on the validation data for each dataset. After training, the prediction results are submitted to the GLUE-benchmark evaluation platform to get the evaluation performance on test data.\nFor a comprehensive evaluation, we experiment with four settings of LadaBERT, namely LadaBERT-1, -2, -3 and -4, which reduce the model parameters of BERT-Base by 2.5, 5, 7.5 and 10 times respectively. In our experiment, we take the batch size as 32, learning rate as 2e-5. The optimizer is BertAdam with default setting. Fine-grained compression ratios are optimized by random search and shown in Table TABREF38.\nThe evaluation results of LadaBERT and state-of-the-art approaches are listed in Table TABREF40, where the models are ranked by parameter sizes for feasible comparison. As shown in the table, LadaBERT consistently outperforms the strongest baselines under similar model sizes. In addition, the performance of LadaBERT demonstrates the superiority of hybrid combination of SVD-based matrix factorization, weight pruning and knowledge distillation.\nWith model size of $2.5\\times $ reduction, LadaBERT-1 performs significantly better than BERT-PKD, boosting the performance by relative 8.9, 8.1, 6.1, 3.8 and 5.8 percentages on MNLI-m, MNLI-mm, SST-2, QQP and QNLI datasets respectively. Recall that BERT-PKD initializes the student model by selecting 3 of 12 layers in the pre-trained BERT-Base model. It turns out that the discarded layers have huge impact on the model performance, which is hard to be recovered by knowledge distillation. On the other hand, LadaBERT generates the student model by iterative pruning on the pre-trained teacher. In this way, the original knowledge in the teacher model can be preserved to the largest extent, and the benefit of which is complementary to knowledge distillation.\nLadaBERT-3 has a comparable size as TinyBERT with a $7.5 \\times $ compression ratio. As shown in the results, TinyBERT does not work well without expensive data augmentation and general distillation, hindering its application to low-resource settings. The reason is that the student model of TinyBERT is distilled from scratch, so it requires much more data to mimic the teacher's behaviors. Instead, LadaBERT has better initial and intermediate status calculated by hybrid model compression, which is much more light-weighted and achieves competitive performances with much faster learning speed (learning curve comparison is shown in Section SECREF41). Moreover, LadaBERT-3 also outperforms BERT-SMALL on most of the datasets, which is pre-trained from scratch by the official BERT pipeline on a $7.5 \\times $ smaller architecture. This indicates that LadaBERT can quickly adapt to a smaller model size and achieve competitive performance without expansive re-training on a large corpus.\nMoreover, Distilled-BiLSTM performs well on SST-2 dataset with more than $10 \\times $ compression ratio, perhaps owing to its advantage of generalization on small datasets. Nevertheless, the performance of LadaBERT-4 is competitive on larger datasets such as MNLI and QQP. This is impressive as LadaBERT is much more efficient without exhaustive re-training on a large corpus. In addition, the inference speed of BiLSTM is usually slower than transformer-based models with similar parameter sizes.\nTo further demonstrate the efficiency of LadaBERT, we visualize the learning curves on MNLI-m and QQP datasets in Figure FIGREF42 and FIGREF42, where LadaBERT-3 is compared to the strongest baseline, TinyBERT, under $7.5 \\times $ compression ratio. As shown in the figures, LadaBERT-3 achieves good performances much faster and results in a better convergence point. After training $2 \\times 10^4$ steps (batches) on MNLI-m dataset, the performance of LadaBERT-3 is already comparable to TinyBERT after convergence (approximately $2 \\times 10^5$ steps), achieving nearly $10 \\times $ acceleration. And on QQP dataset, both performance improvement and training speed acceleration is very significant. This clearly shows the superiority of combining matrix factorization, weight pruning and knowledge distillation in a reinforce manner. Instead, TinyBERT is based on pure knowledge distillation, so the learning speed is much slower.\nIn this paper, we demonstrate that a combination of matrix factorization and weight pruning is better than single solutions for BERT-oriented model compression. Similar phenomena has been reported in the computer vision scenarios BIBREF28, which shows that low-rank and sparsity are complementary to each other. Here we provide another explanation to support this observation.\nIn Figure FIGREF44, we visualize the distribution of errors for a weight matrix in the neural network after pruning to 20% of its original parameter size. The errors can be calculated by $\\mathop {Error}=||\\hat{{M}}-{M}||_1$, where $\\hat{{M}}$ denotes the weight matrix after pruning.\nThe yellow line in Figure FIGREF44 shows the distribution of errors generated by pure weight pruning, which has a sudden drop at the pruning threshold. The orange line represents for pure SVD pruning, which turns out to be smoother and aligned with Gaussian distribution. The blue line shows the result of hybrid pruning, which conducts weight pruning on the decomposed matrices. First, we apply SVD-based matrix factorization to reduce 60% of total parameters. Then, weight pruning is applied on the decomposed matrices by 50%, resulting in only 20% parameters while the error distribution changes slightly. As a result, it has smaller mean and deviation than pure matrix factorization. In addition, a smoother distribution is more appropriate for the knowledge distillation procedure to fine-tune the weights, so it is advantageous than pure weight pruning.\nModel compression is a common way to deal with latency-critical or memory-intensive scenarios. Existing model compression methods for BERT need to be re-trained on a large corpus to reserve its original performance, which is inapplicable in low-resource settings. In this paper, we propose LadaBERT to address this problem. LadaBERT is a lightweight model compression pipeline that generates adaptive BERT model efficiently based on a given task and specific constraint. It is based on a hybrid solution, which conducts matrix factorization, weight pruning and knowledge distillation in a reinforce manner. The experimental results verify that EAdaBERT is able to achieve comparable performance with other state-of-the-art solutions using much less training data and time budget. Therefore, LadaBERT can be easily plugged into various applications with competitive performances and little training overheads. In the future, we would like to apply LadaBERT to large-scale industrial applications, such as search relevance and query recommendation.", "question": "On which datasets does LadaBERT achieve state-of-the-art?", "expected_output": "MNLI-m, MNLI-mm, SST-2, QQP, QNLI.

{"id": "1603.07252", "prompt": "The need to access and digest large amounts of textual data has provided strong impetus to develop automatic summarization systems aiming to create shorter versions of one or more documents, whilst preserving their information content. Much effort in automatic summarization has been devoted to sentence extraction, where a summary is created by identifying and subsequently concatenating the most salient text units in a document.\nMost extractive methods to date identify sentences based on human-engineered features. These include surface features such as sentence position and length BIBREF0 , the words in the title, the presence of proper nouns, content features such as word frequency BIBREF1 , and event features such as action nouns BIBREF2 . Sentences are typically assigned a score indicating the strength of presence of these features. Several methods have been used in order to select the summary sentences ranging from binary classifiers BIBREF3 , to hidden Markov models BIBREF4 , graph-based algorithms BIBREF5 , BIBREF6 , and integer linear programming BIBREF7 .\nIn this work we propose a data-driven approach to summarization based on neural networks and continuous sentence features. There has been a surge of interest recently in repurposing sequence transduction neural network architectures for NLP tasks such as machine translation BIBREF8 , question answering BIBREF9 , and sentence compression BIBREF10 . Central to these approaches is an encoder-decoder architecture modeled by recurrent neural networks. The encoder reads the source sequence into a list of continuous-space representations from which the decoder generates the target sequence. An attention mechanism BIBREF11 is often used to locate the region of focus during decoding.\nWe develop a general framework for single-document summarization which can be used to extract sentences or words. Our model includes a neural network-based hierarchical document reader or encoder and an attention-based content extractor. The role of the reader is to derive the meaning representation of a document based on its sentences and their constituent words. Our models adopt a variant of neural attention to extract sentences or words. Contrary to previous work where attention is an intermediate step used to blend hidden units of an encoder to a vector propagating additional information to the decoder, our model applies attention directly to select sentences or words of the input document as the output summary. Similar neural attention architectures have been previously used for geometry reasoning BIBREF12 , under the name Pointer Networks.\nOne stumbling block to applying neural network models to extractive summarization is the lack of training data, i.e., documents with sentences (and words) labeled as summary-worthy. Inspired by previous work on summarization BIBREF7 , BIBREF13 and reading comprehension BIBREF9 we retrieve hundreds of thousands of news articles and corresponding highlights from the DailyMail website. Highlights usually appear as bullet points giving a brief overview of the information contained in the article (see Figure 1 for an example). Using a number of transformation and scoring algorithms, we are able to match highlights to document content and construct two large scale training datasets, one for sentence extraction and the other for word extraction. Previous approaches have used small scale training data in the range of a few hundred examples.\nOur work touches on several strands of research within summarization and neural sequence modeling. The idea of creating a summary by extracting words from the source document was pioneered in bankoetal00 who view summarization as a problem analogous to statistical machine translation and generate headlines using statistical models for selecting and ordering the summary words. Our word-based model is similar in spirit, however, it operates over continuous representations, produces multi-sentence output, and jointly selects summary words and organizes them into sentences. A few recent studies BIBREF14 , BIBREF15 perform sentence extraction based on pre-trained sentence embeddings following an unsupervised optimization paradigm. Our work also uses continuous representations to express the meaning of sentences and documents, but importantly employs neural networks more directly to perform the actual summarization task.\nrush2015neural propose a neural attention model for abstractive sentence compression which is trained on pairs of headlines and first sentences in an article. In contrast, our model summarizes documents rather than individual sentences, producing multi-sentential discourse. A major architectural difference is that our decoder selects output symbols from the document of interest rather than the entire vocabulary. This effectively helps us sidestep the difficulty of searching for the next output symbol under a large vocabulary, with low-frequency words and named entities whose representations can be challenging to learn. Gu:ea:16 and gulcehre2016pointing propose a similar \u201ccopy\u201d mechanism in sentence compression and other tasks; their model can accommodate both generation and extraction by selecting which sub-sequences in the input sequence to copy in the output.\nWe evaluate our models both automatically (in terms of Rouge) and by humans on two datasets: the benchmark DUC 2002 document summarization corpus and our own DailyMail news highlights corpus. Experimental results show that our summarizers achieve performance comparable to state-of-the-art systems employing hand-engineered features and sophisticated linguistic constraints.\nIn this section we formally define the summarization tasks considered in this paper. Given a document $D$ consisting of a sequence of sentences $\\lbrace s_1, \\cdots , s_m\\rbrace $ and a word set $\\lbrace w_1, \\cdots , w_n\\rbrace $ , we are interested in obtaining summaries at two levels of granularity, namely sentences and words.\nSentence extraction aims to create a summary from $D$ by selecting a subset of $j$ sentences (where $j<m$ ). We do this by scoring each sentence within $D$ and predicting a label $y_L \\in {\\lbrace 0,1\\rbrace }$ indicating whether the sentence should be included in the summary. As we apply supervised training, the objective is to maximize the likelihood of all sentence labels $\\mathbf {y}_L=(y_L^1, \\cdots , y_L^m)$ given the input document $D$ and model parameters $\\theta $ : \n$$\\log p(\\mathbf {y}_L |D; \\theta ) = \\sum \\limits _{i=1}^{m} \\log p(y_L^i |D; \\theta )$$   (Eq. 5) \nAlthough extractive methods yield naturally grammatical summaries and require relatively little linguistic analysis, the selected sentences make for long summaries containing much redundant information. For this reason, we also develop a model based on word extraction which seeks to find a subset of words in $D$ and their optimal ordering so as to form a summary $\\mathbf {y}_s = (w^{\\prime }_1, \\cdots , w^{\\prime }_k), w^{\\prime }_i \\in D$ . Compared to sentence extraction which is a sequence labeling problem, this task occupies the middle ground between full abstractive summarization which can exhibit a wide range of rewrite operations and extractive summarization which exhibits none. We formulate word extraction as a language generation task with an output vocabulary restricted to the original document. In our supervised setting, the training goal is to maximize the likelihood of the generated sentences, which can be further decomposed by enforcing conditional dependencies among their constituent words: \n$$\\hspace*{-5.69046pt}\\log p(\\mathbf {y}_s |D;\n\\theta )\\hspace*{-2.84544pt}=\\hspace*{-2.84544pt}\\sum \\limits _{i=1}^{k}\\hspace*{-2.84544pt}\\log p(w^{\\prime }_i | D, w^{\\prime }_1,\\hspace*{-2.84544pt}\\cdots \\hspace*{-2.84544pt}, w^{\\prime }_{i-1}; \\theta )$$   (Eq. 7) \nIn the following section, we discuss the data elicitation methods which allow us to train neural networks based on the above defined objectives.\nData-driven neural summarization models require a large training corpus of documents with labels indicating which sentences (or words) should be in the summary. Until now such corpora have been limited to hundreds of examples (e.g., the DUC 2002 single document summarization corpus) and thus used mostly for testing BIBREF7 . To overcome the paucity of annotated data for training, we adopt a methodology similar to hermann2015teaching and create two large-scale datasets, one for sentence extraction and another one for word extraction.\nIn a nutshell, we retrieved hundreds of thousands of news articles and their corresponding highlights from DailyMail (see Figure 1 for an example). The highlights (created by news editors) are genuinely abstractive summaries and therefore not readily suited to supervised training. To create the training data for sentence extraction, we reverse approximated the gold standard label of each document sentence given the summary based on their semantic correspondence BIBREF7 . Specifically, we designed a rule-based system that determines whether a document sentence matches a highlight and should be labeled with 1 (must be in the summary), and 0 otherwise. The rules take into account the position of the sentence in the document, the unigram and bigram overlap between document sentences and highlights, the number of entities appearing in the highlight and in the document sentence. We adjusted the weights of the rules on 9,000 documents with manual sentence labels created by woodsend2010automatic. The method obtained an accuracy of 85% when evaluated on a held-out set of 216 documents coming from the same dataset and was subsequently used to label 200K documents. Approximately 30% of the sentences in each document were deemed summary-worthy.\nFor the creation of the word extraction dataset, we examine the lexical overlap between the highlights and the news article. In cases where all highlight words (after stemming) come from the original document, the document-highlight pair constitutes a valid training example and is added to the word extraction dataset. For out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words, we try to find a semantically equivalent replacement present in the news article. Specifically, we check if a neighbor, represented by pre-trained embeddings, is in the original document and therefore constitutes a valid substitution. If we cannot find any substitutes, we discard the document-highlight pair. Following this procedure, we obtained a word extraction dataset containing 170K articles, again from the DailyMail.\nThe key components of our summarization model include a neural network-based hierarchical document reader and an attention-based hierarchical content extractor. The hierarchical nature of our model reflects the intuition that documents are generated compositionally from words, sentences, paragraphs, or even larger units. We therefore employ a representation framework which reflects the same architecture, with global information being discovered and local information being preserved. Such a representation yields minimum information loss and is flexible allowing us to apply neural attention for selecting salient sentences and words within a larger context. In the following, we first describe the document reader, and then present the details of our sentence and word extractors.\nThe role of the reader is to derive the meaning representation of the document from its constituent sentences, each of which is treated as a sequence of words. We first obtain representation vectors at the sentence level using a single-layer convolutional neural network (CNN) with a max-over-time pooling operation BIBREF16 , BIBREF17 , BIBREF18 . Next, we build representations for documents using a standard recurrent neural network (RNN) that recursively composes sentences. The CNN operates at the word level, leading to the acquisition of sentence-level representations that are then used as inputs to the RNN that acquires document-level representations, in a hierarchical fashion. We describe these two sub-components of the text reader below.\nWe opted for a convolutional neural network model for representing sentences for two reasons. Firstly, single-layer CNNs can be trained effectively (without any long-term dependencies in the model) and secondly, they have been successfully used for sentence-level classification tasks such as sentiment analysis BIBREF19 . Let $d$ denote the dimension of word embeddings, and $s$ a document sentence consisting of a sequence of $n$ words $(w_1, \\cdots , w_n)$ which can be represented by a dense column matrix $\\mathbf {W} \\in \\mathbb {R}^{n \\times d}$ . We apply a temporal narrow convolution between $\\mathbf {W}$ and a kernel $\\mathbf {K} \\in \\mathbb {R}^{c \\times d}$ of width $c$ as follows: \n$$\\mathbf {f}^{i}_{j} = \\tanh (\\mathbf {W}_{j : j+c-1} \\otimes \\mathbf {K} + b)$$   (Eq. 12) \nwhere $\\otimes $ equates to the Hadamard Product followed by a sum over all elements. $\\mathbf {f}^i_j $ denotes the $j$ -th element of the $i$ -th feature map $\\mathbf {f}^i$ and $b$ is the bias. We perform max pooling over time to obtain a single feature (the $i$ th feature) representing the sentence under the kernel $\\mathbf {K}$ with width $c$ : \n$$\\mathbf {s}_{i, \\mathbf {K}}= \\max _j \\mathbf {f}_j^i$$   (Eq. 13) \nIn practice, we use multiple feature maps to compute a list of features that match the dimensionality of a sentence under each kernel width. In addition, we apply multiple kernels with different widths to obtain a set of different sentence vectors. Finally, we sum these sentence vectors to obtain the final sentence representation. The CNN model is schematically illustrated in Figure 2 (bottom). In the example, the sentence embeddings have six dimensions, so six feature maps are used under each kernel width. The blue feature maps have width two and the red feature maps have width three. The sentence embeddings obtained under each kernel width are summed to get the final sentence representation (denoted by green).\nAt the document level, a recurrent neural network composes a sequence of sentence vectors into a document vector. Note that this is a somewhat simplistic attempt at capturing document organization at the level of sentence to sentence transitions. One might view the hidden states of the recurrent neural network as a list of partial representations with each focusing mostly on the corresponding input sentence given the previous context. These representations altogether constitute the document representation, which captures local and global sentential information with minimum compression.\nThe RNN we used has a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) activation unit for ameliorating the vanishing gradient problem when training long sequences BIBREF20 . Given a document $d=(s_1,\n\\cdots , s_m)$ , the hidden state at time step $t$ , denoted by $\\mathbf {h_t}$ , is updated as: \n$$\\begin{bmatrix}\n\\mathbf {i}_t\\\\ \\mathbf {f}_t\\\\ \\mathbf {o}_t\\\\ \\mathbf {\\hat{c}}_t\n\\end{bmatrix} =\n\\begin{bmatrix} \\sigma \\\\ \\sigma \\\\ \\sigma \\\\ \\tanh \\end{bmatrix} \\mathbf {W}\\cdot \\begin{bmatrix} \\mathbf {h}_{t-1}\\\\ \\mathbf {s}_t\n\\end{bmatrix}$$   (Eq. 15) \n$$ \\mathbf {c}_t = \\mathbf {f}_t \\odot \\mathbf {c}_{t-1} +\n\\mathbf {i}_t \\odot \\mathbf {\\hat{c}}_t$$   (Eq. 16) \nwhere $\\mathbf {W}$ is a learnable weight matrix. Next, we discuss a special attention mechanism for extracting sentences and words given the recurrent document encoder just described, starting from the sentence extractor.\nIn the standard neural sequence-to-sequence modeling paradigm BIBREF11 , an attention mechanism is used as an intermediate step to decide which input region to focus on in order to generate the next output. In contrast, our sentence extractor applies attention to directly extract salient sentences after reading them.\nThe extractor is another recurrent neural network that labels sentences sequentially, taking into account not only whether they are individually relevant but also mutually redundant. The complete architecture for the document encoder and the sentence extractor is shown in Figure 2 . As can be seen, the next labeling decision is made with both the encoded document and the previously labeled sentences in mind. Given encoder hidden states $(h_1, \\cdots , h_m)$ and extractor hidden states $(\\bar{h}_1, \\cdots , \\bar{h}_m)$ at time step $t$ , the decoder attends the $t$ -th sentence by relating its current decoding state to the corresponding encoding state: \n$$\\bar{\\mathbf {h}}_{t} = \\text{LSTM} ( p_{t-1} \\mathbf {s}_{t-1}, \\mathbf {\\bar{h}}_{t-1})$$   (Eq. 20) \n$$p(y_L(t)=1 | D ) = \\sigma (\\text{MLP} (\\mathbf {\\bar{h}}_t : \\mathbf {h}_t) )$$   (Eq. 21) \nwhere MLP is a multi-layer neural network with as input the concatenation of $\\mathbf {\\bar{h}}_t$ and $\\mathbf {h}_t$ . $p_{t-1}$ represents the degree to which the extractor believes the previous sentence should be extracted and memorized ( $p_{t-1}$ =1 if the system is certain; 0 otherwise).\nIn practice, there is a discrepancy between training and testing such a model. During training we know the true label $p_{t-1}$ of the previous sentence, whereas at test time $p_{t-1}$ is unknown and has to be predicted by the model. The discrepancy can lead to quickly accumulating prediction errors, especially when mistakes are made early in the sequence labeling process. To mitigate this, we adopt a curriculum learning strategy BIBREF21 : at the beginning of training when $p_{t-1}$ cannot be predicted accurately, we set it to the true label of the previous sentence; as training goes on, we gradually shift its value to the predicted label $p(y_L(t-1)=1\n| d )$ .\nCompared to sentence extraction which is a purely sequence labeling task, word extraction is closer to a generation task where relevant content must be selected and then rendered fluently and grammatically. A small extension to the structure of the sequential labeling model makes it suitable for generation: instead of predicting a label for the next sentence at each time step, the model directly outputs the next word in the summary. The model uses a hierarchical attention architecture: at time step $t$ , the decoder softly attends each document sentence and subsequently attends each word in the document and computes the probability of the next word to be included in the summary $p(w^{\\prime }_t = w_i|\nd, w^{\\prime }_1, \\cdots , w^{\\prime }_{t-1})$ with a softmax classifier: \n$$\\bar{\\mathbf {h}}_{t} = \\text{LSTM} ( \\mathbf {w^{\\prime }}_{t-1},\n\\mathbf {\\bar{h}}_{t-1})\\footnote {We empirically found that feeding\nthe previous sentence-level attention vector as additional\ninput to the LSTM would lead to small performance improvements.\nThis is not shown in the equation.}$$   (Eq. 25) \n$$a_j^t = \\mathbf {z}^\\mathtt {T} \\tanh (\\mathbf {W}_e \\mathbf {\\bar{h}}_t + \\mathbf {W}_r \\mathbf {h}_j), h_j \\in D$$   (Eq. 26) \nIn the above equations, $\\mathbf {w}_i$ corresponds to the vector of the $i$ -th word in the input document, whereas $\\mathbf {z}$ , $\\mathbf {W}_e$ , $\\mathbf {W}_r$ , $\\mathbf {v}$ , $\\mathbf {W}_{e^{\\prime }}$ , and $\\mathbf {W}_{r^{\\prime }}$ are model weights. The model architecture is shown in Figure 3 .\nThe word extractor can be viewed as a conditional language model with a vocabulary constraint. In practice, it is not powerful enough to enforce grammaticality due to the lexical diversity and sparsity of the document highlights. A possible enhancement would be to pair the extractor with a neural language model, which can be pre-trained on a large amount of unlabeled documents and then jointly tuned with the extractor during decoding BIBREF23 . A simpler alternative which we adopt is to use $n$ -gram features collected from the document to rerank candidate summaries obtained via beam decoding. We incorporate the features in a log-linear reranker whose feature weights are optimized with minimum error rate training BIBREF24 .\nIn this section we present our experimental setup for assessing the performance of our summarization models. We discuss the datasets used for training and evaluation, give implementation details, briefly introduce comparison models, and explain how system output was evaluated.\nTable 1 (upper half) summarizes our results on the DUC 2002 test dataset using Rouge. nn-se represents our neural sentence extraction model, nn-we our word extraction model, and nn-abs the neural abstractive baseline. The table also includes results for the lead baseline, the logistic regression classifier (lreg), and three previously published systems (ilp, tgraph, and urank).\nThe nn-se outperforms the lead and lreg baselines with a significant margin, while performing slightly better than the ilp model. This is an encouraging result since our model has only access to embedding features obtained from raw text. In comparison, lreg uses a set of manually selected features, while the ilp system takes advantage of syntactic information and extracts summaries subject to well-engineered linguistic constraints, which are not available to our models. Overall, our sentence extraction model achieves performance comparable to the state of the art without sophisticated constraint optimization (ilp, tgraph) or sentence ranking mechanisms (urank). We visualize the sentence weights of the nn-se model in the top half of Figure 4 . As can be seen, the model is able to locate text portions which contribute most to the overall meaning of the document.\nRouge scores for the word extraction model are less promising. This is somewhat expected given that Rouge is $n$ -gram based and not very well suited to measuring summaries which contain a significant amount of paraphrasing and may deviate from the reference even though they express similar meaning. However, a meaningful comparison can be carried out between nn-we and nn-abs which are similar in spirit. We observe that nn-we consistently outperforms the purely abstractive model. As nn-we generates summaries by picking words from the original document, decoding is easier for this model compared to nn-abs which deals with an open vocabulary. The extraction-based generation approach is more robust for proper nouns and rare words, which pose a serious problem to open vocabulary models. An example of the generated summaries for nn-we is shown at the lower half of Figure 4 .\nTable 1 (lower half) shows system results on the 500 DailyMail news articles (test set). In general, we observe similar trends to DUC 2002, with nn-se performing the best in terms of all rouge metrics. Note that scores here are generally lower compared to DUC 2002. This is due to the fact that the gold standard summaries (aka highlights) tend to be more laconic and as a result involve a substantial amount of paraphrasing. More experimental results on this dataset are provided in the appendix.\nThe results of our human evaluation study are shown in Table 2 . Specifically, we show, proportionally, how often our participants ranked each system 1st, 2nd, and so on. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the human-written descriptions were considered best and ranked 1st 27% of the time, however closely followed by our nn-se model which was ranked 1st 22% of the time. The ilp system was mostly ranked in 2nd place (38% of the time). The rest of the systems occupied lower ranks. We further converted the ranks to ratings on a scale of 1 to 6 (assigning ratings 6 $\\dots $ 1 to rank placements 1 $\\dots $ 6). This allowed us to perform Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) which revealed a reliable effect of system type. Specifically, post-hoc Tukey tests showed that nn-se and ilp are significantly ( $p < 0.01$ ) better than lead, nn-we, and nn-abs but do not differ significantly from each other or the human goldstandard.\nIn this work we presented a data-driven summarization framework based on an encoder-extractor architecture. We developed two classes of models based on sentence and word extraction. Our models can be trained on large scale datasets and learn informativeness features based on continuous representations without recourse to linguistic annotations. Two important ideas behind our work are the creation of hierarchical neural structures that reflect the nature of the summarization task and generation by extraction. The later effectively enables us to sidestep the difficulties of generating under a large vocabulary, essentially covering the entire dataset, with many low-frequency words and named entities.\nDirections for future work are many and varied. One way to improve the word-based model would be to take structural information into account during generation, e.g., by combining it with a tree-based algorithm BIBREF31 . It would also be interesting to apply the neural models presented here in a phrase-based setting similar to lebret2015phrase. A third direction would be to adopt an information theoretic perspective and devise a purely unsupervised approach that selects summary sentences and words so as to minimize information loss, a task possibly achievable with the dataset created in this work.\nWe would like to thank three anonymous reviewers and members of the ILCC at the School of Informatics for their valuable feedback. The support of the European Research Council under award number 681760 \u201cTranslating Multiple Modalities into Text\u201d is gratefully acknowledged.\nIn addition to the DUC 2002 and 500 DailyMail samples, we additionally report results on the entire DailyMail test set (Table 3 ).

{"id": "1603.07252", "prompt": "The need to access and digest large amounts of textual data has provided strong impetus to develop automatic summarization systems aiming to create shorter versions of one or more documents, whilst preserving their information content. Much effort in automatic summarization has been devoted to sentence extraction, where a summary is created by identifying and subsequently concatenating the most salient text units in a document.\nMost extractive methods to date identify sentences based on human-engineered features. These include surface features such as sentence position and length BIBREF0 , the words in the title, the presence of proper nouns, content features such as word frequency BIBREF1 , and event features such as action nouns BIBREF2 . Sentences are typically assigned a score indicating the strength of presence of these features. Several methods have been used in order to select the summary sentences ranging from binary classifiers BIBREF3 , to hidden Markov models BIBREF4 , graph-based algorithms BIBREF5 , BIBREF6 , and integer linear programming BIBREF7 .\nIn this work we propose a data-driven approach to summarization based on neural networks and continuous sentence features. There has been a surge of interest recently in repurposing sequence transduction neural network architectures for NLP tasks such as machine translation BIBREF8 , question answering BIBREF9 , and sentence compression BIBREF10 . Central to these approaches is an encoder-decoder architecture modeled by recurrent neural networks. The encoder reads the source sequence into a list of continuous-space representations from which the decoder generates the target sequence. An attention mechanism BIBREF11 is often used to locate the region of focus during decoding.\nWe develop a general framework for single-document summarization which can be used to extract sentences or words. Our model includes a neural network-based hierarchical document reader or encoder and an attention-based content extractor. The role of the reader is to derive the meaning representation of a document based on its sentences and their constituent words. Our models adopt a variant of neural attention to extract sentences or words. Contrary to previous work where attention is an intermediate step used to blend hidden units of an encoder to a vector propagating additional information to the decoder, our model applies attention directly to select sentences or words of the input document as the output summary. Similar neural attention architectures have been previously used for geometry reasoning BIBREF12 , under the name Pointer Networks.\nOne stumbling block to applying neural network models to extractive summarization is the lack of training data, i.e., documents with sentences (and words) labeled as summary-worthy. Inspired by previous work on summarization BIBREF7 , BIBREF13 and reading comprehension BIBREF9 we retrieve hundreds of thousands of news articles and corresponding highlights from the DailyMail website. Highlights usually appear as bullet points giving a brief overview of the information contained in the article (see Figure 1 for an example). Using a number of transformation and scoring algorithms, we are able to match highlights to document content and construct two large scale training datasets, one for sentence extraction and the other for word extraction. Previous approaches have used small scale training data in the range of a few hundred examples.\nOur work touches on several strands of research within summarization and neural sequence modeling. The idea of creating a summary by extracting words from the source document was pioneered in bankoetal00 who view summarization as a problem analogous to statistical machine translation and generate headlines using statistical models for selecting and ordering the summary words. Our word-based model is similar in spirit, however, it operates over continuous representations, produces multi-sentence output, and jointly selects summary words and organizes them into sentences. A few recent studies BIBREF14 , BIBREF15 perform sentence extraction based on pre-trained sentence embeddings following an unsupervised optimization paradigm. Our work also uses continuous representations to express the meaning of sentences and documents, but importantly employs neural networks more directly to perform the actual summarization task.\nrush2015neural propose a neural attention model for abstractive sentence compression which is trained on pairs of headlines and first sentences in an article. In contrast, our model summarizes documents rather than individual sentences, producing multi-sentential discourse. A major architectural difference is that our decoder selects output symbols from the document of interest rather than the entire vocabulary. This effectively helps us sidestep the difficulty of searching for the next output symbol under a large vocabulary, with low-frequency words and named entities whose representations can be challenging to learn. Gu:ea:16 and gulcehre2016pointing propose a similar \u201ccopy\u201d mechanism in sentence compression and other tasks; their model can accommodate both generation and extraction by selecting which sub-sequences in the input sequence to copy in the output.\nWe evaluate our models both automatically (in terms of Rouge) and by humans on two datasets: the benchmark DUC 2002 document summarization corpus and our own DailyMail news highlights corpus. Experimental results show that our summarizers achieve performance comparable to state-of-the-art systems employing hand-engineered features and sophisticated linguistic constraints.\nIn this section we formally define the summarization tasks considered in this paper. Given a document $D$ consisting of a sequence of sentences $\\lbrace s_1, \\cdots , s_m\\rbrace $ and a word set $\\lbrace w_1, \\cdots , w_n\\rbrace $ , we are interested in obtaining summaries at two levels of granularity, namely sentences and words.\nSentence extraction aims to create a summary from $D$ by selecting a subset of $j$ sentences (where $j<m$ ). We do this by scoring each sentence within $D$ and predicting a label $y_L \\in {\\lbrace 0,1\\rbrace }$ indicating whether the sentence should be included in the summary. As we apply supervised training, the objective is to maximize the likelihood of all sentence labels $\\mathbf {y}_L=(y_L^1, \\cdots , y_L^m)$ given the input document $D$ and model parameters $\\theta $ : \n$$\\log p(\\mathbf {y}_L |D; \\theta ) = \\sum \\limits _{i=1}^{m} \\log p(y_L^i |D; \\theta )$$   (Eq. 5) \nAlthough extractive methods yield naturally grammatical summaries and require relatively little linguistic analysis, the selected sentences make for long summaries containing much redundant information.

Given a document $d=(s_1,\n\\cdots , s_m)$ , the hidden state at time step $t$ , denoted by $\\mathbf {h_t}$ , is updated as: \n$$\\begin{bmatrix}\n\\mathbf {i}_t\\\\ \\mathbf {f}_t\\\\ \\mathbf {o}_t\\\\ \\mathbf {\\hat{c}}_t\n\\end{bmatrix} =\n\\begin{bmatrix} \\sigma \\\\ \\sigma \\\\ \\sigma \\\\ \\tanh \\end{bmatrix} \\mathbf {W}\\cdot \\begin{bmatrix} \\mathbf {h}_{t-1}\\\\ \\mathbf {s}_t\n\\end{bmatrix}$$   (Eq. 15) \n$$ \\mathbf {c}_t = \\mathbf {f}_t \\odot \\mathbf {c}_{t-1} +\n\\mathbf {i}_t \\odot \\mathbf {\\hat{c}}_t$$   (Eq. 16) \nwhere $\\mathbf {W}$ is a learnable weight matrix. Next, we discuss a special attention mechanism for extracting sentences and words given the recurrent document encoder just described, starting from the sentence extractor.\nIn the standard neural sequence-to-sequence modeling paradigm BIBREF11 , an attention mechanism is used as an intermediate step to decide which input region to focus on in order to generate the next output. In contrast, our sentence extractor applies attention to directly extract salient sentences after reading them.\nThe extractor is another recurrent neural network that labels sentences sequentially, taking into account not only whether they are individually relevant but also mutually redundant. The complete architecture for the document encoder and the sentence extractor is shown in Figure 2 . As can be seen, the next labeling decision is made with both the encoded document and the previously labeled sentences in mind. Given encoder hidden states $(h_1, \\cdots , h_m)$ and extractor hidden states $(\\bar{h}_1, \\cdots , \\bar{h}_m)$ at time step $t$ , the decoder attends the $t$ -th sentence by relating its current decoding state to the corresponding encoding state: \n$$\\bar{\\mathbf {h}}_{t} = \\text{LSTM} ( p_{t-1} \\mathbf {s}_{t-1}, \\mathbf {\\bar{h}}_{t-1})$$   (Eq. 20) \n$$p(y_L(t)=1 | D ) = \\sigma (\\text{MLP} (\\mathbf {\\bar{h}}_t : \\mathbf {h}_t) )$$   (Eq. 21) \nwhere MLP is a multi-layer neural network with as input the concatenation of $\\mathbf {\\bar{h}}_t$ and $\\mathbf {h}_t$ . $p_{t-1}$ represents the degree to which the extractor believes the previous sentence should be extracted and memorized ( $p_{t-1}$ =1 if the system is certain; 0 otherwise).\nIn practice, there is a discrepancy between training and testing such a model. During training we know the true label $p_{t-1}$ of the previous sentence, whereas at test time $p_{t-1}$ is unknown and has to be predicted by the model. The discrepancy can lead to quickly accumulating prediction errors, especially when mistakes are made early in the sequence labeling process. To mitigate this, we adopt a curriculum learning strategy BIBREF21 : at the beginning of training when $p_{t-1}$ cannot be predicted accurately, we set it to the true label of the previous sentence; as training goes on, we gradually shift its value to the predicted label $p(y_L(t-1)=1\n| d )$ .\nCompared to sentence extraction which is a purely sequence labeling task, word extraction is closer to a generation task where relevant content must be selected and then rendered fluently and grammatically. A small extension to the structure of the sequential labeling model makes it suitable for generation: instead of predicting a label for the next sentence at each time step, the model directly outputs the next word in the summary. The model uses a hierarchical attention architecture: at time step $t$ , the decoder softly attends each document sentence and subsequently attends each word in the document and computes the probability of the next word to be included in the summary $p(w^{\\prime }_t = w_i|\nd, w^{\\prime }_1, \\cdots , w^{\\prime }_{t-1})$ with a softmax classifier: \n$$\\bar{\\mathbf {h}}_{t} = \\text{LSTM} ( \\mathbf {w^{\\prime }}_{t-1},\n\\mathbf {\\bar{h}}_{t-1})\\footnote {We empirically found that feeding\nthe previous sentence-level attention vector as additional\ninput to the LSTM would lead to small performance improvements.\nThis is not shown in the equation.}$$   (Eq. 25) \n$$a_j^t = \\mathbf {z}^\\mathtt {T} \\tanh (\\mathbf {W}_e \\mathbf {\\bar{h}}_t + \\mathbf {W}_r \\mathbf {h}_j), h_j \\in D$$   (Eq. 26) \nIn the above equations, $\\mathbf {w}_i$ corresponds to the vector of the $i$ -th word in the input document, whereas $\\mathbf {z}$ , $\\mathbf {W}_e$ , $\\mathbf {W}_r$ , $\\mathbf {v}$ , $\\mathbf {W}_{e^{\\prime }}$ , and $\\mathbf {W}_{r^{\\prime }}$ are model weights. The model architecture is shown in Figure 3 .\nThe word extractor can be viewed as a conditional language model with a vocabulary constraint. In practice, it is not powerful enough to enforce grammaticality due to the lexical diversity and sparsity of the document highlights. A possible enhancement would be to pair the extractor with a neural language model, which can be pre-trained on a large amount of unlabeled documents and then jointly tuned with the extractor during decoding BIBREF23 . A simpler alternative which we adopt is to use $n$ -gram features collected from the document to rerank candidate summaries obtained via beam decoding. We incorporate the features in a log-linear reranker whose feature weights are optimized with minimum error rate training BIBREF24 .\nIn this section we present our experimental setup for assessing the performance of our summarization models. We discuss the datasets used for training and evaluation, give implementation details, briefly introduce comparison models, and explain how system output was evaluated.\nTable 1 (upper half) summarizes our results on the DUC 2002 test dataset using Rouge. nn-se represents our neural sentence extraction model, nn-we our word extraction model, and nn-abs the neural abstractive baseline. The table also includes results for the lead baseline, the logistic regression classifier (lreg), and three previously published systems (ilp, tgraph, and urank).\nThe nn-se outperforms the lead and lreg baselines with a significant margin, while performing slightly better than the ilp model. This is an encouraging result since our model has only access to embedding features obtained from raw text. In comparison, lreg uses a set of manually selected features, while the ilp system takes advantage of syntactic information and extracts summaries subject to well-engineered linguistic constraints, which are not available to our models. Overall, our sentence extraction model achieves performance comparable to the state of the art without sophisticated constraint optimization (ilp, tgraph) or sentence ranking mechanisms (urank). We visualize the sentence weights of the nn-se model in the top half of Figure 4 . As can be seen, the model is able to locate text portions which contribute most to the overall meaning of the document.\nRouge scores for the word extraction model are less promising. This is somewhat expected given that Rouge is $n$ -gram based and not very well suited to measuring summaries which contain a significant amount of paraphrasing and may deviate from the reference even though they express similar meaning. However, a meaningful comparison can be carried out between nn-we and nn-abs which are similar in spirit. We observe that nn-we consistently outperforms the purely abstractive model. As nn-we generates summaries by picking words from the original document, decoding is easier for this model compared to nn-abs which deals with an open vocabulary. The extraction-based generation approach is more robust for proper nouns and rare words, which pose a serious problem to open vocabulary models. An example of the generated summaries for nn-we is shown at the lower half of Figure 4 .\nTable 1 (lower half) shows system results on the 500 DailyMail news articles (test set). In general, we observe similar trends to DUC 2002, with nn-se performing the best in terms of all rouge metrics. Note that scores here are generally lower compared to DUC 2002. This is due to the fact that the gold standard summaries (aka highlights) tend to be more laconic and as a result involve a substantial amount of paraphrasing. More experimental results on this dataset are provided in the appendix.\nThe results of our human evaluation study are shown in Table 2 . Specifically, we show, proportionally, how often our participants ranked each system 1st, 2nd, and so on. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the human-written descriptions were considered best and ranked 1st 27% of the time, however closely followed by our nn-se model which was ranked 1st 22% of the time. The ilp system was mostly ranked in 2nd place (38% of the time). The rest of the systems occupied lower ranks. We further converted the ranks to ratings on a scale of 1 to 6 (assigning ratings 6 $\\dots $ 1 to rank placements 1 $\\dots $ 6). This allowed us to perform Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) which revealed a reliable effect of system type. Specifically, post-hoc Tukey tests showed that nn-se and ilp are significantly ( $p < 0.01$ ) better than lead, nn-we, and nn-abs but do not differ significantly from each other or the human goldstandard.\nIn this work we presented a data-driven summarization framework based on an encoder-extractor architecture. We developed two classes of models based on sentence and word extraction. Our models can be trained on large scale datasets and learn informativeness features based on continuous representations without recourse to linguistic annotations. Two important ideas behind our work are the creation of hierarchical neural structures that reflect the nature of the summarization task and generation by extraction. The later effectively enables us to sidestep the difficulties of generating under a large vocabulary, essentially covering the entire dataset, with many low-frequency words and named entities.\nDirections for future work are many and varied. One way to improve the word-based model would be to take structural information into account during generation, e.g., by combining it with a tree-based algorithm BIBREF31 . It would also be interesting to apply the neural models presented here in a phrase-based setting similar to lebret2015phrase. A third direction would be to adopt an information theoretic perspective and devise a purely unsupervised approach that selects summary sentences and words so as to minimize information loss, a task possibly achievable with the dataset created in this work.\nWe would like to thank three anonymous reviewers and members of the ILCC at the School of Informatics for their valuable feedback. The support of the European Research Council under award number 681760 \u201cTranslating Multiple Modalities into Text\u201d is gratefully acknowledged.\nIn addition to the DUC 2002 and 500 DailyMail samples, we additionally report results on the entire DailyMail test set (Table 3 ).

{"id": "1708.00549", "prompt": "A core problem in artificial intelligence is to capture, in machine-usable form, the collection of information that an ordinary person would have, known as commonsense knowledge. For example, a machine should know that a room may have a door, and that when a person enters a room, it is generally through a door. This background knowledge is crucial for solving many difficult, ambiguous natural language problems in coreference resolution and question answering, as well as the creation of other reasoning machines.\nMore than just curating a static collection of facts, we would like commonsense knowledge to be represented in a way that lends itself to machine reasoning and inference of missing information. We concern ourselves in this paper with the problem of learning commonsense knowledge representations.\nIn machine learning settings, knowledge is usually represented as a hypergraph of triplets such as Freebase BIBREF1 , WordNet BIBREF2 , and ConceptNet BIBREF3 . In these knowledge graphs, nodes represent entities or terms $t$ , and hyperedges are relations $R$ between these entities or terms, with each fact in the knowledge graph represented as a triplet $<t_1, R, t_2>$ . Researchers have developed many models for knowledge representation and learning in this setting BIBREF4 , BIBREF5 , BIBREF6 , BIBREF7 , BIBREF8 , under the umbrella of knowledge graph completion. However, none of these naturally lend themselves to traditional methods of logical reasoning such as transitivity and negation.\nWhile a knowledge graph completion model can represent relations such as Is-A and entailment, there is no mechanism to ensure that its predictions are internally consistent. For example, if we know that a dog is a mammal, and a pit bull is a dog, we would like the model to also predict that a pit bull is a mammal. These transitive entailment relations describe ontologies of hierarchical data, a key component of commonsense knowledge which we focus on in this work.\nRecently, a thread of research on representation learning has aimed to create embedding spaces that automatically enforce consistency in these predictions using the intrinsic geometry of the embedding space BIBREF9 , BIBREF0 , BIBREF10 . In these models, the inferred embedding space creates a globally consistent structured prediction of the ontology, rather than the local relation predictions of previous models.\nWe focus on the order-embedding model BIBREF0 which was proposed for general hierarchical prediction including multimodal problems such as image captioning. While the original work included results on ontology prediction on WordNet, we focus exclusively on the model's application to commonsense knowledge, with its unique characteristics including complex ordering structure, compositional, multi-word entities, and the wealth of commonsense knowledge to be found in large-scale unstructured text data.\nWe propose two extensions to the order embedding model. The first augments hierarchical supervision from existing ontologies with non-hierarchical knowledge in the form of raw text. We find incorporating unstructured text brings accuracy from 92.0 to 93.0 on a commonsense dataset containing Is-A relations from ConceptNet and Microsoft Concept Graph (MCG), with larger relative gains from smaller amounts of labeled data.\nThe second extension uses the complex partial-order structure of real-world ontologies to find long-distance triplet constraints among embeddings which are poorly enforced by the standard pairwise training method. By adding our additional triplet constraints to the baseline order-embedding model, we find performance improves from 90.6 to 91.3 accuracy on the WordNet ontology dataset.\nWe find that order embeddings' ease of extension, both by incorporating non-ordered data, and additional training constraints derived from the structure of the problem, makes it a promising avenue for the development of further algorithms for automatic learning and jointly consistent prediction of ontologies.\nIn this work, we use the ConceptNet BIBREF3 , WordNet BIBREF2 , and Microsoft Concept Graph (MCG) BIBREF11 , BIBREF12 knowledge bases for our ontology prediction experiments.\nWordNet is a knowledge base (KB) of single words and relations between them such as hypernymy and meronymy. For our task, we use the hypernym relations only. ConceptNet is a KB of triples consisting of a left term $t_1$ , a relation $R$ , and a right term $t_2$ . The relations come from a fixed set of size 34. But unlike WordNet, terms in ConceptNet can be phrases. We focus on the Is-A relation in this work. MCG also consists of hierarchical relations between multi-word phrases, ranging from extremely general to specific. Examples from each dataset are shown in Table 1 .\nFor experiments involving unstructured text, we use the WaCkypedia corpus BIBREF13 .\nWe introduce two variants of order embeddings. The first incorporates non-hierarchical unstructured text data into the supervised ontology. The second improves the training procedure by adding additional examples representing long-range constraints.\nOrder Embeddings are a model for automatically enforcing partial-ordering (or lattice) constraints among predictions directly in embedding space. The vector embeddings satisfy the following property with respect to the partial order: $\nx \\preceq y \\text{ if and only if } \\bigwedge _{i=1}^{N}x_{i}\\ge y_i\n$ \nwhere $x$ is the subcategory and $y$ is the supercategory. This means the general concept embedding should be smaller than the specific concept embedding in every coordinate of the embeddings. An illustration of this geometry can be found in Figure 1. We can define a surrogate energy for this ordering function as $d(x, y) = \\left\\Vert  \\max (0,y-x) \\right\\Vert ^2$ . The learning objective for order embeddings becomes the following, where $m$ is a margin parameter, $x$ and $y$ are the hierarchically supervised pairs, and $x^{\\prime }$ and $y^{\\prime }$ are negatively sampled concepts: $\nL_{\\text{Order}} = \\sum _{x,y}\\max (0, m+d(x,y)-d(x^{\\prime }, y^{\\prime }))\n$ \nWe aim to augment our ontology prediction embedding model with more general commonsense knowledge mined from raw text. A standard method for learning word representations is word2vec BIBREF14 , which predicts current word embeddings using a context of surrounding word embeddings. We incorporate a modification of the CBOW model in this work, which uses the average embedding from a window around the current word as a context vector $v_2$ to predict the current word vector $v_1$ : $\nv_2 = \\frac{1}{window}\\sum _{k \\in \\lbrace -window/2,...,window/2\\rbrace \\setminus \\lbrace t\\rbrace }v_{t+k}\n$ \n Because order embeddings are all positive and compared coordinate-wise, we use a variant of CBOW that scores similarity to context based on based on $L_1$ distance and not dot product, $v^{\\prime }_1$ and $v^{\\prime }_2$ are the negative examples selected from the vocabulary during training: $\n& d_\\text{pos} = d(v_1,v_2) = \\left\\Vert  v_1- v_2\\right\\Vert \\\\\n& d_\\text{neg} = d(v^{\\prime }_1, v^{\\prime }_2) = \\left\\Vert  v^{\\prime }_1- v^{\\prime }_2\\right\\Vert  \\\\\n& L_{\\text{CBOW}}= \\sum _{w_c,w_t}\\max (0, m+d_\\text{pos}-d_\\text{neg})\n$ \nFinally, after each gradient update, we map the embeddings back to the positive domain by applying the absolute value function. We propose jointly learning both the order- and text- embedding model with a simple weighted combination of the two objective functions: $\n&L_{\\text{Joint}} = \\alpha _{1}L_{\\text{Order}}+\\alpha _{2}L_{\\text{CBOW}}\n$ \nWe perform two sets of experiments on the combined ConceptNet and MCG Is-A relations, using different amounts of training and testing data. The first data set, called Data1, uses 119,159 training examples, 1,089 dev examples, and 1,089 test examples. The second dataset, Data2, evenly splits the data in 47,662 examples for each set.\nOur baselines for this model are a standard order embedding model, and a bilinear classifier BIBREF6 trained to predict Is-A, both with and without additional unstructured text augmenting the model in the same way as the joint order embedding model.\nWe see in Table 2 that while adding extra text data helps all models, the best performance is consistently achieved by a combination of order embeddings and unstructured text.\nOrder embeddings map words to a partially-ordered space, which we can think of as a directed acyclic graph (DAG). A simple way to add more training examples is to take the transitive closure of this graph. For example, if we have $<$ dog IsA mammal $>$ , $<$ mammal IsA animal $>$ , we can produce the training example $<$ dog IsA animal $>$ .\nWe observe that even more training examples can be created by treating our partial-order structure as a lattice. A lattice is a partial order equipped with two additional operations, join and meet. The join and meet of a pair P are respectively the supremum (least upper bound) of P, denoted $\\vee $ , and the infimum (greatest lower bound), denoted $\\wedge $ . In our case, the vector join and meet would be the pointwise max and min of two embeddings.\nWe can add many additional training examples to our data by enforcing that the vector join and meet operations satisfy the joins and meets found in the training lattice/DAG. If $w_c$ and $w_p$ are the nearest common child and parent for a pair $w_1, w_2$ , the loss for join and meet learning can be written as the following: $\n& d_c(w_1,w_2,w_c) = \\left\\Vert  \\max (0,w_1 \\vee w_2-w_c) \\right\\Vert ^2 \\\\\n& d_p(w_1,w_2,w_p) = \\left\\Vert  \\max (0,w_p - w_1 \\wedge w_2) \\right\\Vert ^2 \\\\\n& {\\small L_\\text{join} = \\sum _{w_1,w_2,w_c}\\max (0, m+d_c(w_1,w_2,w_c))}\\\\\n& {\\small L_\\text{meet} = \\sum _{w_1,w_2,w_p}\\max (0, m+d_p(w_1,w_2,w_p))}\\\\\n& L = L_\\text{join} + L_\\text{meet}\n$ \nIn this experiment, we use the same dataset as BIBREF0 , created by taking 40,00 edges from the 838,073-edge transitive closure of the WordNet hierarchy for the dev set, 4,000 for the test set, and training on the rest of the transitive closure. We additionally add the long-range join and meet constraints (3,028,302 and 4,006 respectively) between different concepts and see that the inclusion of this additional supervision results in further improvement over the baseline order embedding model, as seen in Table 3.\nIn both sets of experiments we train all models using the Adam optimizer BIBREF15 , using embeddings of dimension 50, with all hyperparameters tuned on a development set. When embedding multi-word phrases, we represent them as the average of the constituent word embeddings.\nIn this work we presented two extensions to the order embedding model. The first incorporates unstructured text to improve performance on Is-A relations, while the second uses long-range constraints automatically derived from the ontology to provide the model with more useful global supervision.

If $w_c$ and $w_p$ are the nearest common child and parent for a pair $w_1, w_2$ , the loss for join and meet learning can be written as the following: $\n& d_c(w_1,w_2,w_c) = \\left\\Vert  \\max (0,w_1 \\vee w_2-w_c) \\right\\Vert ^2 \\\\\n& d_p(w_1,w_2,w_p) = \\left\\Vert  \\max (0,w_p - w_1 \\wedge w_2) \\right\\Vert ^2 \\\\\n& {\\small L_\\text{join} = \\sum _{w_1,w_2,w_c}\\max (0, m+d_c(w_1,w_2,w_c))}\\\\\n& {\\small L_\\text{meet} = \\sum _{w_1,w_2,w_p}\\max (0, m+d_p(w_1,w_2,w_p))}\\\\\n& L = L_\\text{join} + L_\\text{meet}\n$ \nIn this experiment, we use the same dataset as BIBREF0 , created by taking 40,00 edges from the 838,073-edge transitive closure of the WordNet hierarchy for the dev set, 4,000 for the test set, and training on the rest of the transitive closure. We additionally add the long-range join and meet constraints (3,028,302 and 4,006 respectively) between different concepts and see that the inclusion of this additional supervision results in further improvement over the baseline order embedding model, as seen in Table 3.\nIn both sets of experiments we train all models using the Adam optimizer BIBREF15 , using embeddings of dimension 50, with all hyperparameters tuned on a development set. When embedding multi-word phrases, we represent them as the average of the constituent word embeddings.\nIn this work we presented two extensions to the order embedding model. The first incorporates unstructured text to improve performance on Is-A relations, while the second uses long-range constraints automatically derived from the ontology to provide the model with more useful global supervision.

{"id": "1905.00472", "prompt": "The growing adoption of online technologies has created new opportunities for emergency information propagation BIBREF0 . During crises, affected populations post information about what they are experiencing, what they are witnessing, and relate what they hear from other sources BIBREF1 . This information contributes to the creation and dissemination of situational awareness BIBREF2 , BIBREF3 , BIBREF4 , BIBREF0 , and crisis response agencies such as government departments or public health-care NGOs can make use of these channels to gain insight into the situation as it unfolds BIBREF2 , BIBREF5 . Additionally, these organizations might also post time-sensitive crisis management information to help with resource allocation and provide status reports BIBREF6 . While many of these organizations recognize the value of the information found online\u2014specially during the on-set of a crisis\u2014they are in need of automatic tools that locate actionable and tactical information BIBREF7 , BIBREF0 .\nOpinion mining and sentiment analysis techniques offer a viable way of addressing these needs, with complementary insights to what keyword searches or topic and event extraction might offer BIBREF8 . Studies have shown that sentiment analysis of social media during crises can be useful to support response coordination BIBREF9 or provide information about which audiences might be affected by emerging risk events BIBREF10 . For example, identifying tweets labeled as \u201cfear\u201d might support responders on assessing mental health effects among the affected population BIBREF11 . Given the critical and global nature of the HADR events, tools must process information quickly, from a variety of sources and languages, making it easily accessible to first responders and decision makers for damage assessment and to launch relief efforts accordingly BIBREF12 , BIBREF13 . However, research efforts in these tasks are primarily focused on high resource languages such as English, even though such crises may happen anywhere in the world.\nThe LORELEI program provides a framework for developing and testing systems for real-time humanitarian crises response in the context of low-resource languages. The working scenario is as follows: a sudden state of danger requiring immediate action has been identified in a region which communicates in a low resource language. Under strict time constraints, participants are expected to build systems that can: translate documents as necessary, identify relevant named entities and identify the underlying situation BIBREF14 . Situational information is encoded in the form of Situation Frames \u2014 data structures with fields identifying and characterizing the crisis type. The program's objective is the rapid deployment of systems that can process text or speech audio from a variety of sources, including newscasts, news articles, blogs and social media posts, all in the local language, and populate these Situation Frames. While the task of identifying Situation Frames is similar to existing tasks in literature (e.g., slot filling), it is defined by the very limited availability of data BIBREF15 . This lack of data requires the use of simpler but more robust models and the utilization of transfer learning or data augmentation techniques.\nThe Sentiment, Emotion, and Cognitive State (SEC) evaluation task was a recent addition to the LORELEI program introduced in 2019, which aims to leverage sentiment information from the incoming documents. This in turn may be used in identifying severity of the crisis in different geographic locations for efficient distribution of the available resources. In this work, we describe our systems for targeted sentiment detection for the SEC task. Our systems are designed to identify authored expressions of sentiment and emotion towards a HADR crisis. To this end, our models are based on a combination of state-of-the-art sentiment classifiers and simple rule-based systems. We evaluate our systems as part of the NIST LoREHLT 2019 SEC pilot task.\nSocial media has received a lot of attention as a way to understand what people communicate during disasters BIBREF16 , BIBREF11 . These communications typically center around collective sense-making BIBREF17 , supportive actions BIBREF18 , BIBREF19 , and social sharing of emotions and empathetic concerns for affected individuals BIBREF20 . To organize and make sense of the sentiment information found in social media, particularly those messages sent during the disaster, several works propose the use of machine learning models (e.g., Support Vector Machines, Naive Bayes, and Neural Networks) trained on a multitude of linguistic features. These features include bag of words, part-of-speech tags, n-grams, and word embeddings; as well as previously validated sentiment lexica such as Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) BIBREF22 , AFINN BIBREF23 , and SentiWordNet BIBREF24 . Most of the work is centered around identifying messages expressing sentiment towards a particular situation as a way to distinguish crisis-related posts from irrelevant information BIBREF25 . Either in a binary fashion (positive vs. negative) (e.g., BIBREF25 ) or over fine-grained emotional classes (e.g., BIBREF16 ).\nIn contrast to social media posts, sentiment analysis of news articles and blogs has received less attention BIBREF26 . This can be attributed to a more challenging task due to the nature of the domain since, for example, journalists will often refrain from using clearly positive or negative vocabulary when writing news articles BIBREF27 . However, certain aspects of these communication channels are still apt for sentiment analysis, such as column pieces BIBREF28 or political news BIBREF27 , BIBREF29 .\nIn the context of leveraging the information found online for HADR emergencies, approaches for languages other than English have been limited. Most of which are done by manually constructing resources for a particular language (e.g., in tweets BIBREF30 , BIBREF31 , BIBREF32 and in disaster-related news coverage BIBREF33 ), or by applying cross-language text categorization to build language-specific models BIBREF31 , BIBREF34 .\nIn this work, we develop systems that identify positive and negative sentiments expressed in social media posts, news articles and blogs in the context of a humanitarian emergency. Our systems work for both English and Spanish by using an automatic machine translation system. This makes our approach easily extendable to other languages, bypassing the scalability issues that arise from the need to manually construct lexica resources.\nThis section describes the SEC task in the LORELEI program along with the dataset, evaluation conditions and metrics.\nGiven a dataset of text documents and manually annotated situation frames, the task is to automatically detect sentiment polarity relevant to existing frames and identify the source and target for each sentiment instance. The source is defined as a person or a group of people expressing the sentiment, and can be either a PER/ORG/GPE (person, organization or geo political entity) construct in the frame, the author of the text document, or an entity not explicitly expressed in the document. The target toward which the sentiment is expressed, is either the frame or an entity in the document.\nSituation awareness information is encoded into situation frames in the LORELEI program BIBREF35 . Situation Frames (SF) are similar in nature to those used in Natural Language Understanding (NLU) systems: in essence they are data structures that record information corresponding to a single incident at a single location BIBREF15 . A SF frame includes a situation Type taken from a fixed inventory of 11 categories (e.g., medical need, shelter, infrastructure), Location where the situation exists (if a location is mentioned) and additional variables highlighting the Status of the situation (e.g., entities involved in resolution, time and urgency). An example of a SF can be found in table 1 . A list of situation frames and documents serve as input for our sentiment analysis systems.\nTraining data provided for the task included documents were collected from social media, SMS, news articles, and news wires. This consisted of 76 documents in English and 47 in Spanish. The data are relevant to the HADR domain but are not grounded in a common HADR incident. Each document is annotated for situation frames and associated sentiment by 2 trained annotators from the Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC). Sentiment annotations were done at a segment (sentence) level, and included Situation Frame, Polarity (positive / negative), Sentiment Score, Emotion, Source and Target. Sentiment labels were annotated between the values of -3 (very negative) and +3 (very positive) with 0.5 increments excluding 0. Additionally, the presence or absence of three specific emotions: fear, anger, and joy/happiness was marked. If a segment contains sentiment toward more than one target, each will be annotated separately. Summary of the training data is given in Table 2 .\nSystems participating in the task were expected to produce outputs with sentiment polarity, emotion, sentiment source and target, and the supporting segment from the input document. This output is evaluated against a ground truth derived from two or more annotations. For the SEC pilot evaluation, a reference set with dual annotations from two different annotators was provided. The system's performance was measured using variants of precision, recall and f1 score, each modified to take into account the multiple annotations. The modified scoring is as follows: let the agreement between annotators be defined as two annotations with the same sentiment polarity, source, and target. That is, consider two annotators in agreement even if their judgments vary on sentiment values or perceived emotions. Designate those annotations with agreement as \u201cD\u201d and those which were not agreed upon as \u201cS\u201d. When computing precision, recall and f measure, each of the sentiment annotations in D will count as two occurrences in the reference, and likewise a system match on a sentiment annotation in D will count as two matches. Similarly, a match on a sentiment annotation in S will count as a single match. The updated precision, recall and f-measure were defined as follows: $\n\\text{precision} &= \\frac{2 * \\text{Matches in D} + \\text{Matches in S}}{2 * \\text{Matches in D} + \\text{Matches in S} + \\text{Unmatched}}\\\\[10pt]\n\\text{recall} &= \\frac{2 * \\text{Matches in D} + \\text{Matches in S}}{2|D| + |S|}\\\\[10pt]\n\\text{f1} &= \\frac{2 * \\text{precision} * \\text{recall}}{(\\text{precision} + \\text{recall})}\n$ \nWe approach the SEC task, particularly the polarity and emotion identification, as a classification problem. Our systems are based on English, and are extended to other languages via automatic machine translation (to English). In this section we present the linguistic features and describe the models using for the evaluation.\nAutomatic translations from Spanish to English were obtained from Microsoft Bing using their publicly available API. For the pilot evaluation, we translated all of the Spanish documents into English, and included them as additional training data. At this time we do not translate English to Spanish, but plan to explore this thread in future work.\nWe extract word unigrams and bigrams. These features were then transformed using term frequencies (TF) and Inverse document-frequency (IDF).\nWord embeddings pretrained on large corpora allow models to efficiently leverage word semantics as well as similarities between words. This can help with vocabulary generalization as models can adapt to words not previously seen in training data. In our feature set we include a 300-dimensional word2vec word representation trained on a large news corpus BIBREF36 . We obtain a representation for each segment by averaging the embedding of each word in the segment. We also experimented with the use of GloVe BIBREF37 , and Sent2Vec BIBREF38 , an extension of word2vec for sentences.\nWe use two sources of sentiment features: manually constructed lexica, and pre-trained sentiment embeddings. When available, manually constructed lexica are a useful resource for identifying expressions of sentiment BIBREF21 . We obtained word percentages across 192 lexical categories using Empath BIBREF39 , which extends popular tools such as the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) BIBREF22 and General Inquirer (GI) BIBREF40 by adding a wider range of lexical categories. These categories include emotion classes such as surprise or disgust.\nNeural networks have been shown to capture specific task related subtleties which can complement the manually constructed sentiment lexica described in the previous subsection. For this work, we learn sentiment representations using a bilateral Long Short-Term Memory model BIBREF41 trained on the Stanford Sentiment Treebank BIBREF42 . This model was selected because it provided a good trade off between simplicity and performance on a fine-grained sentiment task, and has been shown to achieve competitive results to the state-of-the-art BIBREF43 .\nWe now describe the models used for this work. Our models can be broken down into two groups: our first approach explores state-of-the-art models in targeted and untargeted sentiment analysis to evaluate their performance in the context of the SEC task. These models were pre-trained on larger corpora and evaluated directly on the task without any further adaptation. In a second approach we explore a data augmentation technique based on a proposed simplification of the task. In this approach, traditional machine learning classifiers were trained to identify which segments contain sentiment towards a SF regardless of sentiment polarity. For the classifiers, we explored the use of Support Vector Machines and Random Forests. Model performance was estimated through 10-fold cross validation on the train set. Hyper-parameters, such as of regularization, were selected based on the performance on grid-search using an 10-fold inner-cross validation loop. After choosing the parameters, models were re-trained on all the available data.\nWe consider some of the most popular baseline models in the literature: (i) minority class baseline (due to the heavily imbalanced dataset), (ii) Support Vector Machines trained on TF-IDF bi-gram language model, (iii) and Support Vector Machines trained on word2vec representations. These models were trained using English documents only.\nTwo types of targeted sentiment are evaluated for the task: those expressed towards either a situation frame or those towards an entity. To identify sentiment expressed towards an SF, we use the pretrained model described in BIBREF44 , in which a multiplicative LSTM cell is trained at the character level on a corpus of 82 million Amazon reviews. The model representation is then fed to a logistic regression classifier to predict sentiment. This model (which we will refer to as OpenAI) was chosen since at the time of our system submission it was one of the top three performers on the binary sentiment classification task on the Stanford Sentiment Treebank. In our approach, we first map the text associated with the SF annotation with a segment from the document and pass the full segment to the pretrained OpenAI model identify the sentiment polarity for that segment.\nTo identify sentiment targeted towards an entity, we use the recently released Target-Based Sentiment Analysis (TBSA) model from BIBREF45 . In TBSA, two stacked LSTM cells are trained to predict both sentiment and target boundary tags (e.g., predicting S-POS to indicate the start of the target towards which the author is expressing positive sentiment, I-POS and E-POS to indicate intermediate and end of the target). In our submission, since input text documents can be arbitrarily long, we only consider sentences which include a known and relevant entity; these segments are then fed to the TBSA model to predict targeted sentiment. If the target predicted by this model matched with any of the known entities, the system would output the polarity and the target.\nIn this model we limit our focus on the task of correctly identifying those segments with sentiment towards a SF. That is, given a pair of SF and segment, we train models to identify if this segment contains any sentiment towards that SF. This allows us to expand our dataset from 123 documents into one with $\\sum _d |SF_d| \\times |d|$ number of samples, where $|d|$ is the length of the document (i.e., number of segments) and $|SF_d|$ is the number of SF annotations for document $d$ . Summary of the training dataset after augmentation is given in Table 3 .\nGiven the highly skewed label distribution in the training data, a majority of the constructed pairs do not have any sentiment towards a SF. Hence, our resulting dataset has a highly imbalanced distribution which we address by training our models after setting the class weights to be the inverse class frequency. To predict polarity, we assume the majority class of negative sentiment. We base this assumption on the fact that the domain we are working with doesn't seem to support the presence of positive sentiment, as made evident by the highly imbalanced dataset.\nOwing to the nature of the problem domain, there is considerable variance in the source of the text documents and their structure. For example, tweets only have one segment per sample whereas news articles contain an average of $7.07\\pm 4.96$ and $6.31\\pm 4.93$ segments for English and Spanish documents respectively. Moreover, studies suggest that sentiments expressed in social media tend to differ significantly from those in the news BIBREF26 . Table 4 presents a breakdown of the train set for each sentiment across domains, as is evident tweets form a sizeable group of the training set. Motivated by this, we train different models for tweets and non-tweet documents in order to capture the underlying differences between the data sources.\nInitial experiments showed that our main source of error was not being able to correctly identify the supporting segment. Even if polarity, source and target were correctly identified, missing the correct segment was considered an error, and thus lowered our models' precision. To address this, we decided to use a model which only produced results for tweets given that these only contain one segment, making the segment identification sub-task trivial.\nModel performance during train is presented in Table 5 . While all the models outperformed the baselines, not all of them did so with a significant margin due to the robustness of the baselines selected. The ones found to be significantly better than the baselines were models IIb (Domain-specific) and IIc (Twitter-only) (permutation test, $n = 10^5$ both $p < 0.05$ ). The difference in precision between model IIb and IIc points out to the former making the wrong predictions for news articles. These errors are most likely in selecting the wrong supporting segment. Moreover, even though models IIa-c only produce negative labels, they still achieve improved performance over the state-of-the-art systems, highlighting the highly skewed nature of the training dataset.\nTable 6 present the official evaluation results for English and Spanish. Some information is missing since at the time of submission only partial score had been made public. As previously mentioned, the pre-trained state-of-the-art models (model I) were directly applied to the evaluation data without any adaptation. These performed reasonably well for the English data. Among the submissions of the SEC Task pilot, our systems outperformed the other competitors for both languages.\nUnderstanding the expressed sentiment from an affected population during the on-set of a crisis is a particularly difficult task, especially in low-resource scenarios. There are multiple difficulties beyond the limited amount of data. For example, in order to provide decision-makers with actionable and usable information, it is not enough for the system to correctly classify sentiment or emotional state, it also ought to identify the source and target of the expressed sentiment. To provide a sense of trust and accountability on the system's decisions, it makes sense to identify a justifying segment. Moreover, these systems should consider a variety of information sources to create a broader and richer picture on how a situation unfolds. Thus, it is important that systems take into account the possible differences in the way sentiment is expressed in each one of these sources. In this work, we presented two approaches to the task of providing actionable and useful information. Our results show that state-of-the-art sentiment classifiers can be leveraged out-of-the-box for a reasonable performance on English data. By identifying possible differences coming from the information sources, as well as by exploiting the information communicated as the situation unfolds, we showed significant performance gains on both English and Spanish.", "question": "What were the most salient features extracted by the models?", "expected_output": "unigrams and bigrams.

These categories include emotion classes such as surprise or disgust.\nNeural networks have been shown to capture specific task related subtleties which can complement the manually constructed sentiment lexica described in the previous subsection. For this work, we learn sentiment representations using a bilateral Long Short-Term Memory model BIBREF41 trained on the Stanford Sentiment Treebank BIBREF42 . This model was selected because it provided a good trade off between simplicity and performance on a fine-grained sentiment task, and has been shown to achieve competitive results to the state-of-the-art BIBREF43 .\nWe now describe the models used for this work. Our models can be broken down into two groups: our first approach explores state-of-the-art models in targeted and untargeted sentiment analysis to evaluate their performance in the context of the SEC task. These models were pre-trained on larger corpora and evaluated directly on the task without any further adaptation. In a second approach we explore a data augmentation technique based on a proposed simplification of the task. In this approach, traditional machine learning classifiers were trained to identify which segments contain sentiment towards a SF regardless of sentiment polarity. For the classifiers, we explored the use of Support Vector Machines and Random Forests. Model performance was estimated through 10-fold cross validation on the train set. Hyper-parameters, such as of regularization, were selected based on the performance on grid-search using an 10-fold inner-cross validation loop. After choosing the parameters, models were re-trained on all the available data.\nWe consider some of the most popular baseline models in the literature: (i) minority class baseline (due to the heavily imbalanced dataset), (ii) Support Vector Machines trained on TF-IDF bi-gram language model, (iii) and Support Vector Machines trained on word2vec representations. These models were trained using English documents only.\nTwo types of targeted sentiment are evaluated for the task: those expressed towards either a situation frame or those towards an entity. To identify sentiment expressed towards an SF, we use the pretrained model described in BIBREF44 , in which a multiplicative LSTM cell is trained at the character level on a corpus of 82 million Amazon reviews. The model representation is then fed to a logistic regression classifier to predict sentiment. This model (which we will refer to as OpenAI) was chosen since at the time of our system submission it was one of the top three performers on the binary sentiment classification task on the Stanford Sentiment Treebank. In our approach, we first map the text associated with the SF annotation with a segment from the document and pass the full segment to the pretrained OpenAI model identify the sentiment polarity for that segment.\nTo identify sentiment targeted towards an entity, we use the recently released Target-Based Sentiment Analysis (TBSA) model from BIBREF45 . In TBSA, two stacked LSTM cells are trained to predict both sentiment and target boundary tags (e.g., predicting S-POS to indicate the start of the target towards which the author is expressing positive sentiment, I-POS and E-POS to indicate intermediate and end of the target). In our submission, since input text documents can be arbitrarily long, we only consider sentences which include a known and relevant entity; these segments are then fed to the TBSA model to predict targeted sentiment. If the target predicted by this model matched with any of the known entities, the system would output the polarity and the target.\nIn this model we limit our focus on the task of correctly identifying those segments with sentiment towards a SF. That is, given a pair of SF and segment, we train models to identify if this segment contains any sentiment towards that SF. This allows us to expand our dataset from 123 documents into one with $\\sum _d |SF_d| \\times |d|$ number of samples, where $|d|$ is the length of the document (i.e., number of segments) and $|SF_d|$ is the number of SF annotations for document $d$ . Summary of the training dataset after augmentation is given in Table 3 .\nGiven the highly skewed label distribution in the training data, a majority of the constructed pairs do not have any sentiment towards a SF. Hence, our resulting dataset has a highly imbalanced distribution which we address by training our models after setting the class weights to be the inverse class frequency. To predict polarity, we assume the majority class of negative sentiment. We base this assumption on the fact that the domain we are working with doesn't seem to support the presence of positive sentiment, as made evident by the highly imbalanced dataset.\nOwing to the nature of the problem domain, there is considerable variance in the source of the text documents and their structure. For example, tweets only have one segment per sample whereas news articles contain an average of $7.07\\pm 4.96$ and $6.31\\pm 4.93$ segments for English and Spanish documents respectively. Moreover, studies suggest that sentiments expressed in social media tend to differ significantly from those in the news BIBREF26 . Table 4 presents a breakdown of the train set for each sentiment across domains, as is evident tweets form a sizeable group of the training set. Motivated by this, we train different models for tweets and non-tweet documents in order to capture the underlying differences between the data sources.\nInitial experiments showed that our main source of error was not being able to correctly identify the supporting segment. Even if polarity, source and target were correctly identified, missing the correct segment was considered an error, and thus lowered our models' precision. To address this, we decided to use a model which only produced results for tweets given that these only contain one segment, making the segment identification sub-task trivial.\nModel performance during train is presented in Table 5 . While all the models outperformed the baselines, not all of them did so with a significant margin due to the robustness of the baselines selected. The ones found to be significantly better than the baselines were models IIb (Domain-specific) and IIc (Twitter-only) (permutation test, $n = 10^5$ both $p < 0.05$ ). The difference in precision between model IIb and IIc points out to the former making the wrong predictions for news articles. These errors are most likely in selecting the wrong supporting segment. Moreover, even though models IIa-c only produce negative labels, they still achieve improved performance over the state-of-the-art systems, highlighting the highly skewed nature of the training dataset.\nTable 6 present the official evaluation results for English and Spanish. Some information is missing since at the time of submission only partial score had been made public. As previously mentioned, the pre-trained state-of-the-art models (model I) were directly applied to the evaluation data without any adaptation. These performed reasonably well for the English data. Among the submissions of the SEC Task pilot, our systems outperformed the other competitors for both languages.\nUnderstanding the expressed sentiment from an affected population during the on-set of a crisis is a particularly difficult task, especially in low-resource scenarios. There are multiple difficulties beyond the limited amount of data. For example, in order to provide decision-makers with actionable and usable information, it is not enough for the system to correctly classify sentiment or emotional state, it also ought to identify the source and target of the expressed sentiment. To provide a sense of trust and accountability on the system's decisions, it makes sense to identify a justifying segment. Moreover, these systems should consider a variety of information sources to create a broader and richer picture on how a situation unfolds. Thus, it is important that systems take into account the possible differences in the way sentiment is expressed in each one of these sources. In this work, we presented two approaches to the task of providing actionable and useful information. Our results show that state-of-the-art sentiment classifiers can be leveraged out-of-the-box for a reasonable performance on English data. By identifying possible differences coming from the information sources, as well as by exploiting the information communicated as the situation unfolds, we showed significant performance gains on both English and Spanish.", "question": "How many languages are in the dataset?", "expected_output": "2.

To name just a few examples, recent work has examined patterns in diagram design BIBREF0 and their interpretation in context BIBREF1, and developed frameworks for classifying diagrams BIBREF2 and proposed guidelines for their design BIBREF3. There is also a long-standing interest in processing and generating diagrams computationally BIBREF4, BIBREF5, BIBREF6, which is now resurfacing as advances emerging from deep learning for computer vision and natural language processing are brought to bear on diagrammatic representations BIBREF7, BIBREF8, BIBREF9.\nFrom the perspective of computational processing, diagrammatic representations present a formidable challenge, as they involve tasks from both computer vision and natural language processing. On the one hand, diagrams have a spatial organisation \u2013 layout \u2013 which needs to be segmented to identify meaningful units and their position. Making sense of how diagrams exploit the 2D layout space falls arguably within the domain of computer vision. On the other hand, diagrams also have a discourse structure, which uses the layout space to set up discourse relations between instances of natural language, various types of images, arrows and lines, thus forming a unified discourse organisation. The need to parse this discourse structure shifts the focus towards the field of natural language processing.\nUnderstanding and making inferences about the structure of diagrams and other forms of multimodal discourse may be broadly conceptualised as multimodal discourse parsing. Recent examples of work in this area include alikhanietal2019 and ottoetal2019, who model discourse relations between natural language and photographic images, drawing on linguistic theories of coherence and text\u2013image relations, respectively. In most cases, however, predicting a single discourse relation covers only a part of the discourse structure. sachanetal2019 note that there is a need for comprehensive theories and models of multimodal communication, as they can be used to rethink tasks that have been previously considered only from the perspective of natural language processing.\nUnlike many other areas, the study of diagrammatic representations is particularly well-resourced, as several multimodal resources have been published recently to support research on computational processing of diagrams BIBREF10, BIBREF8, BIBREF11. This study compares two such resources, AI2D BIBREF10 and AI2D-RST BIBREF11, which both feature the same diagrams, as the latter is an extension of the former. Whereas AI2D features crowd-sourced, non-expert annotations, AI2D-RST provides multiple layers of expert annotations, which are informed by state-of-the-art approaches to multimodal communication BIBREF12 and annotation BIBREF13, BIBREF14.\nThis provides an interesting setting for comparison and evaluation, as non-expert annotations are cheap to produce and easily outnumber the expert-annotated data, whose production consumes both time and resources. Expert annotations, however, incorporate domain knowledge from multimodality theory, which is unavailable via crowd-sourcing. Whether expert annotations provide better representations of diagrammatic structures and thus justify their higher cost is one question that this study seeks to answer.\nBoth AI2D and AI2D-RST represent the multimodal structure of diagrams using graphs. This enables learning their representations using graph neural networks, which are gaining currency as a graph is a natural choice for representing many types of data BIBREF15. This article reports on two experiments that evaluate the capability of AI2D and AI2D-RST to represent the multimodal structure of diagrams using graphs, focusing particularly on spatial layout, the hierarchical organisation of diagram elements and their connections expressed using arrows and lines.\nThis section introduces the two multimodal resources compared in this study and discusses related work, beginning with the crowd-sourced annotations in AI2D and continuing with the alternative expert annotations in AI2D-RST, which are built on top of the crowd-sourced descriptions and cover a 1000-diagram subset of the original data. Figure FIGREF1 provides an overview of the two datasets, explains their relation to each other and provides an overview of the experiments reported in Section SECREF4\nThe Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence Diagrams dataset (AI2D) contains 4903 English-language diagrams, which represent topics in primary school natural sciences, such as food webs, human physiology and life cycles, amounting to a total of 17 classes BIBREF10. The dataset was originally developed to support research on diagram understanding and visual question answering BIBREF16, but has also been used to study the contextual interpretation of diagrammatic elements, such as arrows and lines BIBREF17.\nThe AI2D annotation schema models four types of diagram elements: text, graphics, arrows and arrowheads, whereas the semantic relations that hold between these elements are described using ten relations from a framework for analysing diagrammatic representations in engelhardt2002. Each diagram is represented using a Diagram Parse Graph (DPG), whose nodes stand for diagram elements while the edges between the nodes carry information about their semantic relations. The annotation for AI2D, which includes layout segmentations for the diagram images, DPGs and a multiple choice question-answer set, was created by crowd-sourced non-expert annotators on Amazon Mechanical Turk BIBREF10.\nI have previously argued that describing different types of multimodal structures in diagrammatic representations requires different types of graphs BIBREF18. To exemplify, many forms of multimodal discourse are assumed to possess a hierarchical structure, whose representation requires a tree graph. Diagrams, however, use arrows and lines to draw connections between elements that are not necessarily part of the same subtree, and for this reason representing connectivity requires a cyclic graph. AI2D DPGs, in turn, conflate the description of semantic relations and connections expressed using diagrammatic elements. Whether computational modelling of diagrammatic structures, or more generally, multimodal discourse parsing, benefits from pulling apart different types of multimodal structure remains an open question, which we pursued by developing an alternative annotation schema for AI2D, named AI2D-RST, which is introduced below.\nAI2D-RST covers a subset of 1000 diagrams from AI2D, which have been annotated by trained experts using a new multi-layer annotation schema for describing the diagrams in AI2D BIBREF11. The annotation schema, which draws on state-of-the-art theories of multimodal communication BIBREF12, adopts a stand-off approach to describing the diagrams. Hence the three annotation layers in AI2D-RST are represented using three different graphs, which use the same identifiers for nodes across all three graphs to allow combining the descriptions in different graphs. AI2D-RST contains three graphs:\nGrouping: A tree graph that groups together diagram elements that are likely to be visually perceived as belonging together, based loosely on Gestalt principles of visual perception BIBREF19. These groups are organised into a hierarchy, which represents the organisation of content in the 2D layout space BIBREF13, BIBREF14.\nConnectivity: A cyclic graph representing connections between diagram elements or their groups, which are signalled using arrows or lines BIBREF20.\nDiscourse structure: A tree graph representing discourse structure of the diagram using Rhetorical Structure Theory BIBREF21, BIBREF22: hence the name AI2D-RST.\nThe grouping graph, which is initially populated by diagram elements from the AI2D layout segmentation, provides a foundation for describing connectivity and discourse structure by adding nodes to the grouping graph that stand for groups of diagram elements, as shown in the upper part of Figure FIGREF1. In addition, the grouping graph includes annotations for 11 different diagram types identified in the data (e.g. cycles, cross-sections and networks), which may be used as target labels during training, as explained in Section SECREF26 The coarse and fine-grained diagram types identified in the data are shown in Figure FIGREF8.\nhiippalaetal2019-ai2d show that the proposed annotation schema can be reliably applied to the data by measuring inter-annotator agreement between five annotators on random samples from the AI2D-RST corpus using Fleiss' $\\kappa $ BIBREF23. The results show high agreement on grouping ($N = 256, \\kappa = 0.84$), diagram types ($N = 119, \\kappa = 0.78$), connectivity ($N = 239, \\kappa = 0.88$) and discourse structure ($N = 227, \\kappa = 0.73$). It should be noted, however, that these measures may be affected by implicit knowledge that tends to develop among expert annotators who work towards the same task BIBREF24.\nBoth AI2D and AI2D-RST use graphs to represent the multimodal structure of diagrams. This section explicates how the graphs and their node and edge types differ across the two multimodal resources.\nAI2D and AI2D-RST share most node types that represent different diagram elements, namely text, graphics, arrows and the image constant, which is a node that stands for the entire diagram. In AI2D, generic diagram elements such as titles describing the entire diagram are typically connected to the image constant. In AI2D-RST, the image constant acts as the root node of the tree in the grouping graph. In addition to text, graphics, arrows and the image constant, AI2D-RST features two additional node types for groups and discourse relations, whereas AI2D includes an additional node for arrowheads. To summarise, AI2D contains five distinct node types, whereas AI2D-RST has six. Note, however, that only grouping and connectivity graphs used in this study, which limits the number to five for AI2D-RST.\nThe same features are used for both AI2D and AI2D-RST for nodes with layout information, namely text, graphics, arrows and arrowheads (in AI2D only). The position, size and shape of each diagram element are described using the following features: (1) the centre point of the bounding box or polygon, divided by the height and width of the diagram image, (2) area, or the number of pixels within the polygon, divided by the total number of pixels in the image, and (3) the solidity of the polygon, or the polygon area divided by the area of its convex hull. This yields a 4-dimensional feature vector describing the position and size of each diagram element in the layout. Each dimension is set to zero for grouping nodes in AI2D-RST and image constant nodes in AI2D and AI2D-RST.\nAI2D-RST models discourse relations using nodes, which have a 25-dimensional, one-hot encoded feature vector to represent the type of discourse relation, which are drawn from Rhetorical Structure Theory BIBREF21. In AI2D, the discourse relations derived from engelhardt2002 are represented using a 10-dimensional one-hot encoded vector, which is associated with edges connecting diagram elements participating in the relation. Because the two resources draw on different theories and represent discourse relations differently, I use the grouping and connectivity graph for AI2D-RST representations and ignore the edge features in AI2D, as these descriptions attempt to describe roughly the same multimodal structures. A comparison of discourse relations is left for a follow-up study focusing on representing the discourse structure of diagrams.\nWhereas AI2D encodes information about semantic relations using edges, in AI2D-RST the information carried by edges depends on the graph in question. The edges of the grouping graph do not have features, whereas the edges of the connectivity graph have a 3-dimensional, one-hot encoded vector that represents the type of connection. The edges of the discourse structure graph have a 2-dimensional, one-hot encoded feature vector to represent nuclearity, that is, whether the nodes that participate in a discourse relations act as nuclei or satellites.\nFor the experiments reported in Section 4, self-loops are added to each node in the graph. A self-loop is an edge that originates in and terminates at the same node. Self-loops essentially add the graph's identity matrix to the adjacency matrix, which allow the graph neural networks to account for the node's own features during message passing, that is, when sending and receiving features from adjacent nodes.\nThis section presents two experiments that compare AI2D and AI2D-RST annotations in classifying diagrams and their parts using various graph neural networks.\nI evaluated the following graph neural network architectures for both graph and node classification tasks:\nGraph Convolutional Network (GCN) BIBREF25\nSimplifying Graph Convolution (SGC) BIBREF26, averaging incoming node features from up to 2 hops away\nGraph Attention Network (GAT) BIBREF27 with 2 heads\nGraphSAGE (SAGE) BIBREF28 with LSTM aggregation\nI implemented all graph neural networks using Deep Graph Library 0.4 BIBREF29 on the PyTorch 1.3 backend BIBREF30. For GCN, GAT and SAGE, each network consists of two of the aforementioned layers with a Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation, followed by a dense layer and a final softmax function for predicting class membership probabilities. For SGC, the network consists of a single SGC layer without an activation function. The implementations for each network are available in the repository associated with this article.\nI used the Tree of Parzen Estimators (TPE) algorithm BIBREF31 to tune model hyperparameters separately for each dataset, architecture and task using the implementation in the Tune BIBREF32 and hyperopt BIBREF33 libraries. For each dataset, architecture and task, I evaluated a total of 100 hyperparameter combinations for a maximum of 100 epochs, using 850 diagrams for training and 150 for validation. The objective metric to be maximised was macro F1 score. Tables TABREF20 and TABREF21 give the hyperparameters and spaces searched for node and graph classification. Following shcuretal2018, I shuffled the training and validation splits for each run to prevent overfitting and used the same training procedure throughout. I used the Adam optimiser BIBREF34 for both hyperparameter search and training.\nTo address the issue of class imbalance present in both tasks, class weights were calculated by dividing the total number of samples by the product of the number of unique classes and the number of samples for each class, as implemented in scikit-learn BIBREF35. These weights were passed to the loss function during hyperparameter search and training.\nAfter hyperparameter optimisation, I trained each model with the best hyperparameter combination for 20 runs, using 850 diagrams for training, 75 for validation and 75 for testing, shuffling the splits for each run while monitoring performance on the evaluation set and stopping training early if the macro F1 score failed to improve over 15 epochs for graph classification or over 25 epochs for node classification. I then evaluated the model on the testing set and recorded the result.\nThe purpose of the node classification task is to evaluate how well algorithms learn to classify the parts of a diagram using the graph-based representations in AI2D and AI2D-RST and node features representing the position, size and shape of the element, as described in Section SECREF11 Identifying the correct node type is a key step when populating a graph with candidate nodes from object detectors, particularly if the nodes will be processed further, for instance, to extract semantic representations from CNN features or word embeddings. Furthermore, the node representations learned during this task can be used as node features for graph classification, as will be shown shortly below in Section SECREF26\nTable TABREF25 presents a baseline for node classification from a dummy classifier, together with results for random forest and support vector machine classifiers trained on 850 and tested on 150 diagrams. Both AI2D and AI2D-RST include five node types, of which four are the same: the difference is that whereas AI2D includes arrowheads, AI2D-RST includes nodes for groups of diagram elements, as outlined in Section SECREF9 The results seem to reflect the fact that image constants and grouping nodes have their features set to zero, and RF and SVM cannot leverage features incoming from their neighbouring nodes to learn node representations. This is likely to affect the result for AI2D-RST, which includes 7300 grouping nodes that are used to create a hierarchy of diagram elements.\nTable TABREF22 shows the results for node classification using various graph neural network architectures. Because the results are not entirely comparable due to different node types present in the two resources, it is more reasonable to compare architectures. SAGE, GCN and GAT clearly outperform SGC in classifying nodes from both resources, as does the random forest classifier. AI2D nodes are classified with particularly high accuracy, which may result from having to learn representations for only one node type, that is, the image constant ($N = 1000$). AI2D-RST, in turn, must learn representations from scratch for both image constants ($N = 1000$) and grouping nodes ($N = 7300$).\nBecause SAGE learns useful node representations for both resources, as reflected in high performance for all metrics, I chose this architecture for extracting node features for graph classification.\nThis task compares the performance of graph-based representations in AI2D and AI2D-RST for classifying entire diagrams. Here the aim is to evaluate to what extent graph neural networks can learn about the generic structure of primary school science diagrams from the graph-based representations in AI2D and AI2D-RST. Correctly identifying what the diagram attempts to communicate and how carries implications for tasks such as visual question answering, as the type of a diagram constrains the interpretation of key diagrammatic elements, such as the meaning of lines and arrows BIBREF1, BIBREF17.\nTo enable a fair comparison, the target classes are derived from both AI2D and AI2D-RST. Whereas AI2D includes 17 classes that represent the semantic content of diagrams, as exemplified by categories such as `parts of the Earth', `volcano', and `food chains and webs', AI2D-RST classifies diagrams into abstract diagram types, such as cycles, networks, cross-sections and cut-outs. More specifically, AI2D-RST provides classes for diagram types at two levels of granularity, fine-grained (12 classes) and coarse (5 classes), which are derived from the proposed schema for diagram types in AI2D-RST BIBREF11.\nThe 11 fine-grained classes in AI2D-RST shown in Figure FIGREF8 are complemented by an additional class (`mixed'), which includes diagrams that combine multiple diagram types, whose inclusion avoids performing multi-label classification (see the example in Figure FIGREF28). The coarse classes, which are derived by grouping fine-grained classes for tables, tabular and spatial organisations, networks and cycles, diagrammatic and pictorial representations, and so on, are also complemented by a `mixed' class.\nFor this task, the node features consist of the representations learned during node classification in Section SECREF24 These representations are extracted by feeding the features representing node position, size and shape to the graph neural network, which in both cases uses the GraphSAGE architecture BIBREF28, and recording the output of the final softmax activation. Compared to a one-hot encoding, representing node identity using a probability distribution from a softmax activation reduces the sparsity of the feature vector. This yields a 5-dimensional feature vector for each node.\nTable TABREF29 provides a baseline for graph classification from a dummy classifier, as well as results for random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM) classifiers trained on 850 and tested on 150 diagrams. The macro F1 scores show that the RF classifier with 100 decision trees offers competitive performance for all target classes and both AI2D and AI2D-RST, in some cases outperforming graph neural networks. It should be noted, however, that the RF classifier is trained with node features learned using GraphSAGE.\nThe results for graph classification using graph neural networks presented in Table TABREF27 show certain differences between AI2D and AI2D-RST. When classifying diagrams into the original semantic categories defined in AI2D ($N = 17$), the AI2D graphs significantly outperform AI2D-RST when using the GraphSAGE architecture. For all other graph neural networks, the differences between AI2D and AI2D-RST are not statistically significant. This is not surprising as the AI2D graphs were tailored for the original classes, yet the AI2D-RST graphs seem to capture generic properties that help to classify diagrams into semantic categories nearly as accurately as AI2D graphs designed specifically for this purpose, although no semantic features apart from the layout structure are provided to the classifier.\nThe situation is reversed for the coarse ($N = 5$) and fine-grained ($N = 12$) classes from AI2D-RST, in which the AI2D-RST graphs generally outperform AI2D, except for coarse classification using SGC. This classification task obviously benefits AI2D-RST, whose classification schema was originally designed for abstract diagram types. This may also suggest that the AI2D graphs do not capture regularities that would support learning to generalise about diagram types. The situation is somewhat different for fine-grained classification, in which the differences in performance are relatively small.\nGenerally, most architectures do not benefit from combining the grouping and connectivity graphs in AI2D-RST. This is an interesting finding, as many diagram types differ in terms of their connectivity structures (e.g. cycles and networks) BIBREF11. The edges introduced from the connectivity graph naturally increase the flow of information in the graph, but this does not seem to help learn distinctive features between diagram types. On the other hand, it should be noted that the nodes are not typed, that is, the model cannot distinguish between edges from the grouping and connectivity graphs.\nOverall, the macro F1 scores for both AI2D and AI2D-RST, which assigns equal weight to all classes regardless of the number of samples, underline the challenge of training classifiers using limited data with imbalanced classes. The lack of visual features may also affect overall classification performance: certain fine-grained classes, which are also prominent in the data, such as 2D cross-sections and 3D cut-outs, may have similar graph-based representations. Extracting visual features from diagram images may help to discern between diagrams whose graphs bear close resemblance to one another, but this would require advanced object detectors for non-photographic images.\nThe results for AI2D-RST show that the grouping graph, which represents visual perceptual groups of diagram elements and their hierarchical organisation, provides a robust foundation for describing the spatial organisation of diagrammatic representations. This kind of generic schema can be expanded beyond diagrams to other modes of expression that make use of the spatial extent, such as entire page layouts. A description of how the layout space is used can be incorporated into any effort to model discourse relations that may hold between the groups or their parts.\nThe promising results AI2D-RST suggest is that domain experts in multimodal communication should be involved in planning crowd-sourced annotation tasks right from the beginning. Segmentation, in particular, warrants attention as this phase defines the units of analysis: cut-outs and cross-sections, for instance, use labels and lines to pick out sub-regions of graphical objects, whereas in illustrations the labels often refer to entire objects. Such distinctions should preferably be picked out at the very beginning to be incorporated fully into the annotation schema.\nTasks related to grouping and connectivity annotation could be crowd-sourced relatively easily, whereas annotating diagram types and discourse relations may require multi-step procedures and assistance in the form of prompts, as yungetal2019 have recently shown for RST. Involving both expert and crowd-sourced annotators could also alleviate problems related to circularity by forcing domain experts to frame the tasks in terms understandable to crowd-sourced workers BIBREF24.\nIn light of the results for graph classification, one should note that node features are averaged before classification regardless of their connections in the graph. Whereas the expert-annotated grouping graph in AI2D-RST has been pruned from isolated nodes, which ensures that features are propagated to neighbouring nodes, the crowd-sourced AI2D graphs contain both isolated nodes and subgraphs. To what extent these disconnections affect the performance for AI2D warrant a separate study. Additionally, more advanced techniques than mere averaging, such as pooling, should be explored in future work.\nFinally, there are many aspects of diagrammatic representation that were not explored in this study. To begin with, a comparison of representations for discourse structures using the question-answering set accompanying AI2D would be particularly interesting, especially if both AI2D and AI2D-RST graphs were enriched with features from state of the art semantic representations for natural language and graphic elements.\nIn this article, I compared graph-based representations of diagrams representing primary school science topics from two datasets that contain the same diagrams, which have been annotated by either crowd-sourced workers or trained experts. The comparison involved two tasks, graph and node classification, using four different architectures for graph neural networks, which were compared to baselines from dummy, random forest and support vector machine classifiers.\nThe results showed that graph neural networks can learn to accurately identify diagram elements from their size, shape and position in layout. These node representations could then be used as features for graph classification. Identifying diagrams, either in terms of what they represent (semantic content) or how (abstract diagram type), proved more challenging using the graph-based representations. Improving accuracy may require additional features that capture visual properties of the diagrams, as these distinctions cannot be captured by graph-based representations and features focusing on layout.\nOverall, the results nevertheless suggest that simple layout features can provide a foundation for representing diagrammatic structures, which use the layout space to organise the content and set up discourse relations between different elements. To what extent these layout features can support the prediction of actual discourse relations should be explored in future research.", "question": "What are the parts of the \"multimodal\" resources?", "expected_output": "spatial organisation.

Recent examples of work in this area include alikhanietal2019 and ottoetal2019, who model discourse relations between natural language and photographic images, drawing on linguistic theories of coherence and text\u2013image relations, respectively. In most cases, however, predicting a single discourse relation covers only a part of the discourse structure. sachanetal2019 note that there is a need for comprehensive theories and models of multimodal communication, as they can be used to rethink tasks that have been previously considered only from the perspective of natural language processing.\nUnlike many other areas, the study of diagrammatic representations is particularly well-resourced, as several multimodal resources have been published recently to support research on computational processing of diagrams BIBREF10, BIBREF8, BIBREF11. This study compares two such resources, AI2D BIBREF10 and AI2D-RST BIBREF11, which both feature the same diagrams, as the latter is an extension of the former. Whereas AI2D features crowd-sourced, non-expert annotations, AI2D-RST provides multiple layers of expert annotations, which are informed by state-of-the-art approaches to multimodal communication BIBREF12 and annotation BIBREF13, BIBREF14.\nThis provides an interesting setting for comparison and evaluation, as non-expert annotations are cheap to produce and easily outnumber the expert-annotated data, whose production consumes both time and resources. Expert annotations, however, incorporate domain knowledge from multimodality theory, which is unavailable via crowd-sourcing. Whether expert annotations provide better representations of diagrammatic structures and thus justify their higher cost is one question that this study seeks to answer.\nBoth AI2D and AI2D-RST represent the multimodal structure of diagrams using graphs. This enables learning their representations using graph neural networks, which are gaining currency as a graph is a natural choice for representing many types of data BIBREF15. This article reports on two experiments that evaluate the capability of AI2D and AI2D-RST to represent the multimodal structure of diagrams using graphs, focusing particularly on spatial layout, the hierarchical organisation of diagram elements and their connections expressed using arrows and lines.\nThis section introduces the two multimodal resources compared in this study and discusses related work, beginning with the crowd-sourced annotations in AI2D and continuing with the alternative expert annotations in AI2D-RST, which are built on top of the crowd-sourced descriptions and cover a 1000-diagram subset of the original data. Figure FIGREF1 provides an overview of the two datasets, explains their relation to each other and provides an overview of the experiments reported in Section SECREF4\nThe Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence Diagrams dataset (AI2D) contains 4903 English-language diagrams, which represent topics in primary school natural sciences, such as food webs, human physiology and life cycles, amounting to a total of 17 classes BIBREF10. The dataset was originally developed to support research on diagram understanding and visual question answering BIBREF16, but has also been used to study the contextual interpretation of diagrammatic elements, such as arrows and lines BIBREF17.\nThe AI2D annotation schema models four types of diagram elements: text, graphics, arrows and arrowheads, whereas the semantic relations that hold between these elements are described using ten relations from a framework for analysing diagrammatic representations in engelhardt2002. Each diagram is represented using a Diagram Parse Graph (DPG), whose nodes stand for diagram elements while the edges between the nodes carry information about their semantic relations. The annotation for AI2D, which includes layout segmentations for the diagram images, DPGs and a multiple choice question-answer set, was created by crowd-sourced non-expert annotators on Amazon Mechanical Turk BIBREF10.\nI have previously argued that describing different types of multimodal structures in diagrammatic representations requires different types of graphs BIBREF18. To exemplify, many forms of multimodal discourse are assumed to possess a hierarchical structure, whose representation requires a tree graph. Diagrams, however, use arrows and lines to draw connections between elements that are not necessarily part of the same subtree, and for this reason representing connectivity requires a cyclic graph. AI2D DPGs, in turn, conflate the description of semantic relations and connections expressed using diagrammatic elements. Whether computational modelling of diagrammatic structures, or more generally, multimodal discourse parsing, benefits from pulling apart different types of multimodal structure remains an open question, which we pursued by developing an alternative annotation schema for AI2D, named AI2D-RST, which is introduced below.\nAI2D-RST covers a subset of 1000 diagrams from AI2D, which have been annotated by trained experts using a new multi-layer annotation schema for describing the diagrams in AI2D BIBREF11. The annotation schema, which draws on state-of-the-art theories of multimodal communication BIBREF12, adopts a stand-off approach to describing the diagrams. Hence the three annotation layers in AI2D-RST are represented using three different graphs, which use the same identifiers for nodes across all three graphs to allow combining the descriptions in different graphs. AI2D-RST contains three graphs:\nGrouping: A tree graph that groups together diagram elements that are likely to be visually perceived as belonging together, based loosely on Gestalt principles of visual perception BIBREF19. These groups are organised into a hierarchy, which represents the organisation of content in the 2D layout space BIBREF13, BIBREF14.\nConnectivity: A cyclic graph representing connections between diagram elements or their groups, which are signalled using arrows or lines BIBREF20.\nDiscourse structure: A tree graph representing discourse structure of the diagram using Rhetorical Structure Theory BIBREF21, BIBREF22: hence the name AI2D-RST.\nThe grouping graph, which is initially populated by diagram elements from the AI2D layout segmentation, provides a foundation for describing connectivity and discourse structure by adding nodes to the grouping graph that stand for groups of diagram elements, as shown in the upper part of Figure FIGREF1. In addition, the grouping graph includes annotations for 11 different diagram types identified in the data (e.g. cycles, cross-sections and networks), which may be used as target labels during training, as explained in Section SECREF26 The coarse and fine-grained diagram types identified in the data are shown in Figure FIGREF8.\nhiippalaetal2019-ai2d show that the proposed annotation schema can be reliably applied to the data by measuring inter-annotator agreement between five annotators on random samples from the AI2D-RST corpus using Fleiss' $\\kappa $ BIBREF23. The results show high agreement on grouping ($N = 256, \\kappa = 0.84$), diagram types ($N = 119, \\kappa = 0.78$), connectivity ($N = 239, \\kappa = 0.88$) and discourse structure ($N = 227, \\kappa = 0.73$). It should be noted, however, that these measures may be affected by implicit knowledge that tends to develop among expert annotators who work towards the same task BIBREF24.\nBoth AI2D and AI2D-RST use graphs to represent the multimodal structure of diagrams. This section explicates how the graphs and their node and edge types differ across the two multimodal resources.\nAI2D and AI2D-RST share most node types that represent different diagram elements, namely text, graphics, arrows and the image constant, which is a node that stands for the entire diagram. In AI2D, generic diagram elements such as titles describing the entire diagram are typically connected to the image constant. In AI2D-RST, the image constant acts as the root node of the tree in the grouping graph. In addition to text, graphics, arrows and the image constant, AI2D-RST features two additional node types for groups and discourse relations, whereas AI2D includes an additional node for arrowheads. To summarise, AI2D contains five distinct node types, whereas AI2D-RST has six. Note, however, that only grouping and connectivity graphs used in this study, which limits the number to five for AI2D-RST.\nThe same features are used for both AI2D and AI2D-RST for nodes with layout information, namely text, graphics, arrows and arrowheads (in AI2D only). The position, size and shape of each diagram element are described using the following features: (1) the centre point of the bounding box or polygon, divided by the height and width of the diagram image, (2) area, or the number of pixels within the polygon, divided by the total number of pixels in the image, and (3) the solidity of the polygon, or the polygon area divided by the area of its convex hull. This yields a 4-dimensional feature vector describing the position and size of each diagram element in the layout. Each dimension is set to zero for grouping nodes in AI2D-RST and image constant nodes in AI2D and AI2D-RST.\nAI2D-RST models discourse relations using nodes, which have a 25-dimensional, one-hot encoded feature vector to represent the type of discourse relation, which are drawn from Rhetorical Structure Theory BIBREF21. In AI2D, the discourse relations derived from engelhardt2002 are represented using a 10-dimensional one-hot encoded vector, which is associated with edges connecting diagram elements participating in the relation. Because the two resources draw on different theories and represent discourse relations differently, I use the grouping and connectivity graph for AI2D-RST representations and ignore the edge features in AI2D, as these descriptions attempt to describe roughly the same multimodal structures. A comparison of discourse relations is left for a follow-up study focusing on representing the discourse structure of diagrams.\nWhereas AI2D encodes information about semantic relations using edges, in AI2D-RST the information carried by edges depends on the graph in question. The edges of the grouping graph do not have features, whereas the edges of the connectivity graph have a 3-dimensional, one-hot encoded vector that represents the type of connection. The edges of the discourse structure graph have a 2-dimensional, one-hot encoded feature vector to represent nuclearity, that is, whether the nodes that participate in a discourse relations act as nuclei or satellites.\nFor the experiments reported in Section 4, self-loops are added to each node in the graph. A self-loop is an edge that originates in and terminates at the same node. Self-loops essentially add the graph's identity matrix to the adjacency matrix, which allow the graph neural networks to account for the node's own features during message passing, that is, when sending and receiving features from adjacent nodes.\nThis section presents two experiments that compare AI2D and AI2D-RST annotations in classifying diagrams and their parts using various graph neural networks.\nI evaluated the following graph neural network architectures for both graph and node classification tasks:\nGraph Convolutional Network (GCN) BIBREF25\nSimplifying Graph Convolution (SGC) BIBREF26, averaging incoming node features from up to 2 hops away\nGraph Attention Network (GAT) BIBREF27 with 2 heads\nGraphSAGE (SAGE) BIBREF28 with LSTM aggregation\nI implemented all graph neural networks using Deep Graph Library 0.4 BIBREF29 on the PyTorch 1.3 backend BIBREF30. For GCN, GAT and SAGE, each network consists of two of the aforementioned layers with a Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation, followed by a dense layer and a final softmax function for predicting class membership probabilities. For SGC, the network consists of a single SGC layer without an activation function. The implementations for each network are available in the repository associated with this article.\nI used the Tree of Parzen Estimators (TPE) algorithm BIBREF31 to tune model hyperparameters separately for each dataset, architecture and task using the implementation in the Tune BIBREF32 and hyperopt BIBREF33 libraries. For each dataset, architecture and task, I evaluated a total of 100 hyperparameter combinations for a maximum of 100 epochs, using 850 diagrams for training and 150 for validation. The objective metric to be maximised was macro F1 score. Tables TABREF20 and TABREF21 give the hyperparameters and spaces searched for node and graph classification. Following shcuretal2018, I shuffled the training and validation splits for each run to prevent overfitting and used the same training procedure throughout. I used the Adam optimiser BIBREF34 for both hyperparameter search and training.\nTo address the issue of class imbalance present in both tasks, class weights were calculated by dividing the total number of samples by the product of the number of unique classes and the number of samples for each class, as implemented in scikit-learn BIBREF35. These weights were passed to the loss function during hyperparameter search and training.\nAfter hyperparameter optimisation, I trained each model with the best hyperparameter combination for 20 runs, using 850 diagrams for training, 75 for validation and 75 for testing, shuffling the splits for each run while monitoring performance on the evaluation set and stopping training early if the macro F1 score failed to improve over 15 epochs for graph classification or over 25 epochs for node classification. I then evaluated the model on the testing set and recorded the result.\nThe purpose of the node classification task is to evaluate how well algorithms learn to classify the parts of a diagram using the graph-based representations in AI2D and AI2D-RST and node features representing the position, size and shape of the element, as described in Section SECREF11 Identifying the correct node type is a key step when populating a graph with candidate nodes from object detectors, particularly if the nodes will be processed further, for instance, to extract semantic representations from CNN features or word embeddings. Furthermore, the node representations learned during this task can be used as node features for graph classification, as will be shown shortly below in Section SECREF26\nTable TABREF25 presents a baseline for node classification from a dummy classifier, together with results for random forest and support vector machine classifiers trained on 850 and tested on 150 diagrams. Both AI2D and AI2D-RST include five node types, of which four are the same: the difference is that whereas AI2D includes arrowheads, AI2D-RST includes nodes for groups of diagram elements, as outlined in Section SECREF9 The results seem to reflect the fact that image constants and grouping nodes have their features set to zero, and RF and SVM cannot leverage features incoming from their neighbouring nodes to learn node representations. This is likely to affect the result for AI2D-RST, which includes 7300 grouping nodes that are used to create a hierarchy of diagram elements.\nTable TABREF22 shows the results for node classification using various graph neural network architectures. Because the results are not entirely comparable due to different node types present in the two resources, it is more reasonable to compare architectures. SAGE, GCN and GAT clearly outperform SGC in classifying nodes from both resources, as does the random forest classifier. AI2D nodes are classified with particularly high accuracy, which may result from having to learn representations for only one node type, that is, the image constant ($N = 1000$). AI2D-RST, in turn, must learn representations from scratch for both image constants ($N = 1000$) and grouping nodes ($N = 7300$).\nBecause SAGE learns useful node representations for both resources, as reflected in high performance for all metrics, I chose this architecture for extracting node features for graph classification.\nThis task compares the performance of graph-based representations in AI2D and AI2D-RST for classifying entire diagrams. Here the aim is to evaluate to what extent graph neural networks can learn about the generic structure of primary school science diagrams from the graph-based representations in AI2D and AI2D-RST. Correctly identifying what the diagram attempts to communicate and how carries implications for tasks such as visual question answering, as the type of a diagram constrains the interpretation of key diagrammatic elements, such as the meaning of lines and arrows BIBREF1, BIBREF17.\nTo enable a fair comparison, the target classes are derived from both AI2D and AI2D-RST. Whereas AI2D includes 17 classes that represent the semantic content of diagrams, as exemplified by categories such as `parts of the Earth', `volcano', and `food chains and webs', AI2D-RST classifies diagrams into abstract diagram types, such as cycles, networks, cross-sections and cut-outs. More specifically, AI2D-RST provides classes for diagram types at two levels of granularity, fine-grained (12 classes) and coarse (5 classes), which are derived from the proposed schema for diagram types in AI2D-RST BIBREF11.\nThe 11 fine-grained classes in AI2D-RST shown in Figure FIGREF8 are complemented by an additional class (`mixed'), which includes diagrams that combine multiple diagram types, whose inclusion avoids performing multi-label classification (see the example in Figure FIGREF28). The coarse classes, which are derived by grouping fine-grained classes for tables, tabular and spatial organisations, networks and cycles, diagrammatic and pictorial representations, and so on, are also complemented by a `mixed' class.\nFor this task, the node features consist of the representations learned during node classification in Section SECREF24 These representations are extracted by feeding the features representing node position, size and shape to the graph neural network, which in both cases uses the GraphSAGE architecture BIBREF28, and recording the output of the final softmax activation. Compared to a one-hot encoding, representing node identity using a probability distribution from a softmax activation reduces the sparsity of the feature vector. This yields a 5-dimensional feature vector for each node.\nTable TABREF29 provides a baseline for graph classification from a dummy classifier, as well as results for random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM) classifiers trained on 850 and tested on 150 diagrams. The macro F1 scores show that the RF classifier with 100 decision trees offers competitive performance for all target classes and both AI2D and AI2D-RST, in some cases outperforming graph neural networks. It should be noted, however, that the RF classifier is trained with node features learned using GraphSAGE.\nThe results for graph classification using graph neural networks presented in Table TABREF27 show certain differences between AI2D and AI2D-RST. When classifying diagrams into the original semantic categories defined in AI2D ($N = 17$), the AI2D graphs significantly outperform AI2D-RST when using the GraphSAGE architecture. For all other graph neural networks, the differences between AI2D and AI2D-RST are not statistically significant. This is not surprising as the AI2D graphs were tailored for the original classes, yet the AI2D-RST graphs seem to capture generic properties that help to classify diagrams into semantic categories nearly as accurately as AI2D graphs designed specifically for this purpose, although no semantic features apart from the layout structure are provided to the classifier.\nThe situation is reversed for the coarse ($N = 5$) and fine-grained ($N = 12$) classes from AI2D-RST, in which the AI2D-RST graphs generally outperform AI2D, except for coarse classification using SGC. This classification task obviously benefits AI2D-RST, whose classification schema was originally designed for abstract diagram types. This may also suggest that the AI2D graphs do not capture regularities that would support learning to generalise about diagram types. The situation is somewhat different for fine-grained classification, in which the differences in performance are relatively small.\nGenerally, most architectures do not benefit from combining the grouping and connectivity graphs in AI2D-RST. This is an interesting finding, as many diagram types differ in terms of their connectivity structures (e.g. cycles and networks) BIBREF11. The edges introduced from the connectivity graph naturally increase the flow of information in the graph, but this does not seem to help learn distinctive features between diagram types. On the other hand, it should be noted that the nodes are not typed, that is, the model cannot distinguish between edges from the grouping and connectivity graphs.\nOverall, the macro F1 scores for both AI2D and AI2D-RST, which assigns equal weight to all classes regardless of the number of samples, underline the challenge of training classifiers using limited data with imbalanced classes. The lack of visual features may also affect overall classification performance: certain fine-grained classes, which are also prominent in the data, such as 2D cross-sections and 3D cut-outs, may have similar graph-based representations. Extracting visual features from diagram images may help to discern between diagrams whose graphs bear close resemblance to one another, but this would require advanced object detectors for non-photographic images.\nThe results for AI2D-RST show that the grouping graph, which represents visual perceptual groups of diagram elements and their hierarchical organisation, provides a robust foundation for describing the spatial organisation of diagrammatic representations. This kind of generic schema can be expanded beyond diagrams to other modes of expression that make use of the spatial extent, such as entire page layouts. A description of how the layout space is used can be incorporated into any effort to model discourse relations that may hold between the groups or their parts.\nThe promising results AI2D-RST suggest is that domain experts in multimodal communication should be involved in planning crowd-sourced annotation tasks right from the beginning. Segmentation, in particular, warrants attention as this phase defines the units of analysis: cut-outs and cross-sections, for instance, use labels and lines to pick out sub-regions of graphical objects, whereas in illustrations the labels often refer to entire objects. Such distinctions should preferably be picked out at the very beginning to be incorporated fully into the annotation schema.\nTasks related to grouping and connectivity annotation could be crowd-sourced relatively easily, whereas annotating diagram types and discourse relations may require multi-step procedures and assistance in the form of prompts, as yungetal2019 have recently shown for RST. Involving both expert and crowd-sourced annotators could also alleviate problems related to circularity by forcing domain experts to frame the tasks in terms understandable to crowd-sourced workers BIBREF24.\nIn light of the results for graph classification, one should note that node features are averaged before classification regardless of their connections in the graph. Whereas the expert-annotated grouping graph in AI2D-RST has been pruned from isolated nodes, which ensures that features are propagated to neighbouring nodes, the crowd-sourced AI2D graphs contain both isolated nodes and subgraphs. To what extent these disconnections affect the performance for AI2D warrant a separate study. Additionally, more advanced techniques than mere averaging, such as pooling, should be explored in future work.\nFinally, there are many aspects of diagrammatic representation that were not explored in this study. To begin with, a comparison of representations for discourse structures using the question-answering set accompanying AI2D would be particularly interesting, especially if both AI2D and AI2D-RST graphs were enriched with features from state of the art semantic representations for natural language and graphic elements.\nIn this article, I compared graph-based representations of diagrams representing primary school science topics from two datasets that contain the same diagrams, which have been annotated by either crowd-sourced workers or trained experts. The comparison involved two tasks, graph and node classification, using four different architectures for graph neural networks, which were compared to baselines from dummy, random forest and support vector machine classifiers.\nThe results showed that graph neural networks can learn to accurately identify diagram elements from their size, shape and position in layout. These node representations could then be used as features for graph classification. Identifying diagrams, either in terms of what they represent (semantic content) or how (abstract diagram type), proved more challenging using the graph-based representations. Improving accuracy may require additional features that capture visual properties of the diagrams, as these distinctions cannot be captured by graph-based representations and features focusing on layout.\nOverall, the results nevertheless suggest that simple layout features can provide a foundation for representing diagrammatic structures, which use the layout space to organise the content and set up discourse relations between different elements. To what extent these layout features can support the prediction of actual discourse relations should be explored in future research.", "question": "Are annotators familiar with the science topics annotated?", "expected_output": "The annotation for AI2D was\ncreated by crowd-sourced non-expert annotators on AMT while AI2D-RST covers a subset of diagrams from AI2D annotated by trained experts.

{"id": "1912.02866", "prompt": "Diagrams are a common feature of many everyday media from newspapers to school textbooks, and not surprisingly, different forms of diagrammatic representation have been studied from various perspectives. To name just a few examples, recent work has examined patterns in diagram design BIBREF0 and their interpretation in context BIBREF1, and developed frameworks for classifying diagrams BIBREF2 and proposed guidelines for their design BIBREF3. There is also a long-standing interest in processing and generating diagrams computationally BIBREF4, BIBREF5, BIBREF6, which is now resurfacing as advances emerging from deep learning for computer vision and natural language processing are brought to bear on diagrammatic representations BIBREF7, BIBREF8, BIBREF9.\nFrom the perspective of computational processing, diagrammatic representations present a formidable challenge, as they involve tasks from both computer vision and natural language processing. On the one hand, diagrams have a spatial organisation \u2013 layout \u2013 which needs to be segmented to identify meaningful units and their position. Making sense of how diagrams exploit the 2D layout space falls arguably within the domain of computer vision. On the other hand, diagrams also have a discourse structure, which uses the layout space to set up discourse relations between instances of natural language, various types of images, arrows and lines, thus forming a unified discourse organisation.

The edges of the discourse structure graph have a 2-dimensional, one-hot encoded feature vector to represent nuclearity, that is, whether the nodes that participate in a discourse relations act as nuclei or satellites.\nFor the experiments reported in Section 4, self-loops are added to each node in the graph. A self-loop is an edge that originates in and terminates at the same node. Self-loops essentially add the graph's identity matrix to the adjacency matrix, which allow the graph neural networks to account for the node's own features during message passing, that is, when sending and receiving features from adjacent nodes.\nThis section presents two experiments that compare AI2D and AI2D-RST annotations in classifying diagrams and their parts using various graph neural networks.\nI evaluated the following graph neural network architectures for both graph and node classification tasks:\nGraph Convolutional Network (GCN) BIBREF25\nSimplifying Graph Convolution (SGC) BIBREF26, averaging incoming node features from up to 2 hops away\nGraph Attention Network (GAT) BIBREF27 with 2 heads\nGraphSAGE (SAGE) BIBREF28 with LSTM aggregation\nI implemented all graph neural networks using Deep Graph Library 0.4 BIBREF29 on the PyTorch 1.3 backend BIBREF30. For GCN, GAT and SAGE, each network consists of two of the aforementioned layers with a Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation, followed by a dense layer and a final softmax function for predicting class membership probabilities. For SGC, the network consists of a single SGC layer without an activation function. The implementations for each network are available in the repository associated with this article.\nI used the Tree of Parzen Estimators (TPE) algorithm BIBREF31 to tune model hyperparameters separately for each dataset, architecture and task using the implementation in the Tune BIBREF32 and hyperopt BIBREF33 libraries. For each dataset, architecture and task, I evaluated a total of 100 hyperparameter combinations for a maximum of 100 epochs, using 850 diagrams for training and 150 for validation. The objective metric to be maximised was macro F1 score. Tables TABREF20 and TABREF21 give the hyperparameters and spaces searched for node and graph classification. Following shcuretal2018, I shuffled the training and validation splits for each run to prevent overfitting and used the same training procedure throughout. I used the Adam optimiser BIBREF34 for both hyperparameter search and training.\nTo address the issue of class imbalance present in both tasks, class weights were calculated by dividing the total number of samples by the product of the number of unique classes and the number of samples for each class, as implemented in scikit-learn BIBREF35. These weights were passed to the loss function during hyperparameter search and training.\nAfter hyperparameter optimisation, I trained each model with the best hyperparameter combination for 20 runs, using 850 diagrams for training, 75 for validation and 75 for testing, shuffling the splits for each run while monitoring performance on the evaluation set and stopping training early if the macro F1 score failed to improve over 15 epochs for graph classification or over 25 epochs for node classification. I then evaluated the model on the testing set and recorded the result.\nThe purpose of the node classification task is to evaluate how well algorithms learn to classify the parts of a diagram using the graph-based representations in AI2D and AI2D-RST and node features representing the position, size and shape of the element, as described in Section SECREF11 Identifying the correct node type is a key step when populating a graph with candidate nodes from object detectors, particularly if the nodes will be processed further, for instance, to extract semantic representations from CNN features or word embeddings. Furthermore, the node representations learned during this task can be used as node features for graph classification, as will be shown shortly below in Section SECREF26\nTable TABREF25 presents a baseline for node classification from a dummy classifier, together with results for random forest and support vector machine classifiers trained on 850 and tested on 150 diagrams. Both AI2D and AI2D-RST include five node types, of which four are the same: the difference is that whereas AI2D includes arrowheads, AI2D-RST includes nodes for groups of diagram elements, as outlined in Section SECREF9 The results seem to reflect the fact that image constants and grouping nodes have their features set to zero, and RF and SVM cannot leverage features incoming from their neighbouring nodes to learn node representations. This is likely to affect the result for AI2D-RST, which includes 7300 grouping nodes that are used to create a hierarchy of diagram elements.\nTable TABREF22 shows the results for node classification using various graph neural network architectures. Because the results are not entirely comparable due to different node types present in the two resources, it is more reasonable to compare architectures. SAGE, GCN and GAT clearly outperform SGC in classifying nodes from both resources, as does the random forest classifier. AI2D nodes are classified with particularly high accuracy, which may result from having to learn representations for only one node type, that is, the image constant ($N = 1000$). AI2D-RST, in turn, must learn representations from scratch for both image constants ($N = 1000$) and grouping nodes ($N = 7300$).\nBecause SAGE learns useful node representations for both resources, as reflected in high performance for all metrics, I chose this architecture for extracting node features for graph classification.\nThis task compares the performance of graph-based representations in AI2D and AI2D-RST for classifying entire diagrams. Here the aim is to evaluate to what extent graph neural networks can learn about the generic structure of primary school science diagrams from the graph-based representations in AI2D and AI2D-RST. Correctly identifying what the diagram attempts to communicate and how carries implications for tasks such as visual question answering, as the type of a diagram constrains the interpretation of key diagrammatic elements, such as the meaning of lines and arrows BIBREF1, BIBREF17.\nTo enable a fair comparison, the target classes are derived from both AI2D and AI2D-RST. Whereas AI2D includes 17 classes that represent the semantic content of diagrams, as exemplified by categories such as `parts of the Earth', `volcano', and `food chains and webs', AI2D-RST classifies diagrams into abstract diagram types, such as cycles, networks, cross-sections and cut-outs. More specifically, AI2D-RST provides classes for diagram types at two levels of granularity, fine-grained (12 classes) and coarse (5 classes), which are derived from the proposed schema for diagram types in AI2D-RST BIBREF11.\nThe 11 fine-grained classes in AI2D-RST shown in Figure FIGREF8 are complemented by an additional class (`mixed'), which includes diagrams that combine multiple diagram types, whose inclusion avoids performing multi-label classification (see the example in Figure FIGREF28). The coarse classes, which are derived by grouping fine-grained classes for tables, tabular and spatial organisations, networks and cycles, diagrammatic and pictorial representations, and so on, are also complemented by a `mixed' class.\nFor this task, the node features consist of the representations learned during node classification in Section SECREF24 These representations are extracted by feeding the features representing node position, size and shape to the graph neural network, which in both cases uses the GraphSAGE architecture BIBREF28, and recording the output of the final softmax activation. Compared to a one-hot encoding, representing node identity using a probability distribution from a softmax activation reduces the sparsity of the feature vector. This yields a 5-dimensional feature vector for each node.\nTable TABREF29 provides a baseline for graph classification from a dummy classifier, as well as results for random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM) classifiers trained on 850 and tested on 150 diagrams. The macro F1 scores show that the RF classifier with 100 decision trees offers competitive performance for all target classes and both AI2D and AI2D-RST, in some cases outperforming graph neural networks. It should be noted, however, that the RF classifier is trained with node features learned using GraphSAGE.\nThe results for graph classification using graph neural networks presented in Table TABREF27 show certain differences between AI2D and AI2D-RST. When classifying diagrams into the original semantic categories defined in AI2D ($N = 17$), the AI2D graphs significantly outperform AI2D-RST when using the GraphSAGE architecture. For all other graph neural networks, the differences between AI2D and AI2D-RST are not statistically significant. This is not surprising as the AI2D graphs were tailored for the original classes, yet the AI2D-RST graphs seem to capture generic properties that help to classify diagrams into semantic categories nearly as accurately as AI2D graphs designed specifically for this purpose, although no semantic features apart from the layout structure are provided to the classifier.\nThe situation is reversed for the coarse ($N = 5$) and fine-grained ($N = 12$) classes from AI2D-RST, in which the AI2D-RST graphs generally outperform AI2D, except for coarse classification using SGC. This classification task obviously benefits AI2D-RST, whose classification schema was originally designed for abstract diagram types. This may also suggest that the AI2D graphs do not capture regularities that would support learning to generalise about diagram types. The situation is somewhat different for fine-grained classification, in which the differences in performance are relatively small.\nGenerally, most architectures do not benefit from combining the grouping and connectivity graphs in AI2D-RST. This is an interesting finding, as many diagram types differ in terms of their connectivity structures (e.g. cycles and networks) BIBREF11. The edges introduced from the connectivity graph naturally increase the flow of information in the graph, but this does not seem to help learn distinctive features between diagram types. On the other hand, it should be noted that the nodes are not typed, that is, the model cannot distinguish between edges from the grouping and connectivity graphs.\nOverall, the macro F1 scores for both AI2D and AI2D-RST, which assigns equal weight to all classes regardless of the number of samples, underline the challenge of training classifiers using limited data with imbalanced classes. The lack of visual features may also affect overall classification performance: certain fine-grained classes, which are also prominent in the data, such as 2D cross-sections and 3D cut-outs, may have similar graph-based representations. Extracting visual features from diagram images may help to discern between diagrams whose graphs bear close resemblance to one another, but this would require advanced object detectors for non-photographic images.\nThe results for AI2D-RST show that the grouping graph, which represents visual perceptual groups of diagram elements and their hierarchical organisation, provides a robust foundation for describing the spatial organisation of diagrammatic representations. This kind of generic schema can be expanded beyond diagrams to other modes of expression that make use of the spatial extent, such as entire page layouts. A description of how the layout space is used can be incorporated into any effort to model discourse relations that may hold between the groups or their parts.\nThe promising results AI2D-RST suggest is that domain experts in multimodal communication should be involved in planning crowd-sourced annotation tasks right from the beginning. Segmentation, in particular, warrants attention as this phase defines the units of analysis: cut-outs and cross-sections, for instance, use labels and lines to pick out sub-regions of graphical objects, whereas in illustrations the labels often refer to entire objects. Such distinctions should preferably be picked out at the very beginning to be incorporated fully into the annotation schema.\nTasks related to grouping and connectivity annotation could be crowd-sourced relatively easily, whereas annotating diagram types and discourse relations may require multi-step procedures and assistance in the form of prompts, as yungetal2019 have recently shown for RST. Involving both expert and crowd-sourced annotators could also alleviate problems related to circularity by forcing domain experts to frame the tasks in terms understandable to crowd-sourced workers BIBREF24.\nIn light of the results for graph classification, one should note that node features are averaged before classification regardless of their connections in the graph. Whereas the expert-annotated grouping graph in AI2D-RST has been pruned from isolated nodes, which ensures that features are propagated to neighbouring nodes, the crowd-sourced AI2D graphs contain both isolated nodes and subgraphs. To what extent these disconnections affect the performance for AI2D warrant a separate study. Additionally, more advanced techniques than mere averaging, such as pooling, should be explored in future work.\nFinally, there are many aspects of diagrammatic representation that were not explored in this study. To begin with, a comparison of representations for discourse structures using the question-answering set accompanying AI2D would be particularly interesting, especially if both AI2D and AI2D-RST graphs were enriched with features from state of the art semantic representations for natural language and graphic elements.\nIn this article, I compared graph-based representations of diagrams representing primary school science topics from two datasets that contain the same diagrams, which have been annotated by either crowd-sourced workers or trained experts. The comparison involved two tasks, graph and node classification, using four different architectures for graph neural networks, which were compared to baselines from dummy, random forest and support vector machine classifiers.\nThe results showed that graph neural networks can learn to accurately identify diagram elements from their size, shape and position in layout. These node representations could then be used as features for graph classification. Identifying diagrams, either in terms of what they represent (semantic content) or how (abstract diagram type), proved more challenging using the graph-based representations. Improving accuracy may require additional features that capture visual properties of the diagrams, as these distinctions cannot be captured by graph-based representations and features focusing on layout.\nOverall, the results nevertheless suggest that simple layout features can provide a foundation for representing diagrammatic structures, which use the layout space to organise the content and set up discourse relations between different elements. To what extent these layout features can support the prediction of actual discourse relations should be explored in future research.", "question": "How are the expert and crowd-sourced annotations compared to one another?", "expected_output": "by using them as features in classifying diagrams and\ntheir parts using various graph neural networks..

{"id": "1912.02866", "prompt": "Diagrams are a common feature of many everyday media from newspapers to school textbooks, and not surprisingly, different forms of diagrammatic representation have been studied from various perspectives. To name just a few examples, recent work has examined patterns in diagram design BIBREF0 and their interpretation in context BIBREF1, and developed frameworks for classifying diagrams BIBREF2 and proposed guidelines for their design BIBREF3. There is also a long-standing interest in processing and generating diagrams computationally BIBREF4, BIBREF5, BIBREF6, which is now resurfacing as advances emerging from deep learning for computer vision and natural language processing are brought to bear on diagrammatic representations BIBREF7, BIBREF8, BIBREF9.\nFrom the perspective of computational processing, diagrammatic representations present a formidable challenge, as they involve tasks from both computer vision and natural language processing. On the one hand, diagrams have a spatial organisation \u2013 layout \u2013 which needs to be segmented to identify meaningful units and their position. Making sense of how diagrams exploit the 2D layout space falls arguably within the domain of computer vision. On the other hand, diagrams also have a discourse structure, which uses the layout space to set up discourse relations between instances of natural language, various types of images, arrows and lines, thus forming a unified discourse organisation. The need to parse this discourse structure shifts the focus towards the field of natural language processing.\nUnderstanding and making inferences about the structure of diagrams and other forms of multimodal discourse may be broadly conceptualised as multimodal discourse parsing. Recent examples of work in this area include alikhanietal2019 and ottoetal2019, who model discourse relations between natural language and photographic images, drawing on linguistic theories of coherence and text\u2013image relations, respectively. In most cases, however, predicting a single discourse relation covers only a part of the discourse structure. sachanetal2019 note that there is a need for comprehensive theories and models of multimodal communication, as they can be used to rethink tasks that have been previously considered only from the perspective of natural language processing.\nUnlike many other areas, the study of diagrammatic representations is particularly well-resourced, as several multimodal resources have been published recently to support research on computational processing of diagrams BIBREF10, BIBREF8, BIBREF11. This study compares two such resources, AI2D BIBREF10 and AI2D-RST BIBREF11, which both feature the same diagrams, as the latter is an extension of the former. Whereas AI2D features crowd-sourced, non-expert annotations, AI2D-RST provides multiple layers of expert annotations, which are informed by state-of-the-art approaches to multimodal communication BIBREF12 and annotation BIBREF13, BIBREF14.\nThis provides an interesting setting for comparison and evaluation, as non-expert annotations are cheap to produce and easily outnumber the expert-annotated data, whose production consumes both time and resources. Expert annotations, however, incorporate domain knowledge from multimodality theory, which is unavailable via crowd-sourcing. Whether expert annotations provide better representations of diagrammatic structures and thus justify their higher cost is one question that this study seeks to answer.\nBoth AI2D and AI2D-RST represent the multimodal structure of diagrams using graphs. This enables learning their representations using graph neural networks, which are gaining currency as a graph is a natural choice for representing many types of data BIBREF15. This article reports on two experiments that evaluate the capability of AI2D and AI2D-RST to represent the multimodal structure of diagrams using graphs, focusing particularly on spatial layout, the hierarchical organisation of diagram elements and their connections expressed using arrows and lines.\nThis section introduces the two multimodal resources compared in this study and discusses related work, beginning with the crowd-sourced annotations in AI2D and continuing with the alternative expert annotations in AI2D-RST, which are built on top of the crowd-sourced descriptions and cover a 1000-diagram subset of the original data. Figure FIGREF1 provides an overview of the two datasets, explains their relation to each other and provides an overview of the experiments reported in Section SECREF4\nThe Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence Diagrams dataset (AI2D) contains 4903 English-language diagrams, which represent topics in primary school natural sciences, such as food webs, human physiology and life cycles, amounting to a total of 17 classes BIBREF10. The dataset was originally developed to support research on diagram understanding and visual question answering BIBREF16, but has also been used to study the contextual interpretation of diagrammatic elements, such as arrows and lines BIBREF17.\nThe AI2D annotation schema models four types of diagram elements: text, graphics, arrows and arrowheads, whereas the semantic relations that hold between these elements are described using ten relations from a framework for analysing diagrammatic representations in engelhardt2002. Each diagram is represented using a Diagram Parse Graph (DPG), whose nodes stand for diagram elements while the edges between the nodes carry information about their semantic relations. The annotation for AI2D, which includes layout segmentations for the diagram images, DPGs and a multiple choice question-answer set, was created by crowd-sourced non-expert annotators on Amazon Mechanical Turk BIBREF10.\nI have previously argued that describing different types of multimodal structures in diagrammatic representations requires different types of graphs BIBREF18. To exemplify, many forms of multimodal discourse are assumed to possess a hierarchical structure, whose representation requires a tree graph. Diagrams, however, use arrows and lines to draw connections between elements that are not necessarily part of the same subtree, and for this reason representing connectivity requires a cyclic graph. AI2D DPGs, in turn, conflate the description of semantic relations and connections expressed using diagrammatic elements. Whether computational modelling of diagrammatic structures, or more generally, multimodal discourse parsing, benefits from pulling apart different types of multimodal structure remains an open question, which we pursued by developing an alternative annotation schema for AI2D, named AI2D-RST, which is introduced below.\nAI2D-RST covers a subset of 1000 diagrams from AI2D, which have been annotated by trained experts using a new multi-layer annotation schema for describing the diagrams in AI2D BIBREF11. The annotation schema, which draws on state-of-the-art theories of multimodal communication BIBREF12, adopts a stand-off approach to describing the diagrams. Hence the three annotation layers in AI2D-RST are represented using three different graphs, which use the same identifiers for nodes across all three graphs to allow combining the descriptions in different graphs. AI2D-RST contains three graphs:\nGrouping: A tree graph that groups together diagram elements that are likely to be visually perceived as belonging together, based loosely on Gestalt principles of visual perception BIBREF19. These groups are organised into a hierarchy, which represents the organisation of content in the 2D layout space BIBREF13, BIBREF14.\nConnectivity: A cyclic graph representing connections between diagram elements or their groups, which are signalled using arrows or lines BIBREF20.\nDiscourse structure: A tree graph representing discourse structure of the diagram using Rhetorical Structure Theory BIBREF21, BIBREF22: hence the name AI2D-RST.\nThe grouping graph, which is initially populated by diagram elements from the AI2D layout segmentation, provides a foundation for describing connectivity and discourse structure by adding nodes to the grouping graph that stand for groups of diagram elements, as shown in the upper part of Figure FIGREF1. In addition, the grouping graph includes annotations for 11 different diagram types identified in the data (e.g. cycles, cross-sections and networks), which may be used as target labels during training, as explained in Section SECREF26 The coarse and fine-grained diagram types identified in the data are shown in Figure FIGREF8.\nhiippalaetal2019-ai2d show that the proposed annotation schema can be reliably applied to the data by measuring inter-annotator agreement between five annotators on random samples from the AI2D-RST corpus using Fleiss' $\\kappa $ BIBREF23. The results show high agreement on grouping ($N = 256, \\kappa = 0.84$), diagram types ($N = 119, \\kappa = 0.78$), connectivity ($N = 239, \\kappa = 0.88$) and discourse structure ($N = 227, \\kappa = 0.73$). It should be noted, however, that these measures may be affected by implicit knowledge that tends to develop among expert annotators who work towards the same task BIBREF24.\nBoth AI2D and AI2D-RST use graphs to represent the multimodal structure of diagrams. This section explicates how the graphs and their node and edge types differ across the two multimodal resources.\nAI2D and AI2D-RST share most node types that represent different diagram elements, namely text, graphics, arrows and the image constant, which is a node that stands for the entire diagram. In AI2D, generic diagram elements such as titles describing the entire diagram are typically connected to the image constant. In AI2D-RST, the image constant acts as the root node of the tree in the grouping graph. In addition to text, graphics, arrows and the image constant, AI2D-RST features two additional node types for groups and discourse relations, whereas AI2D includes an additional node for arrowheads. To summarise, AI2D contains five distinct node types, whereas AI2D-RST has six. Note, however, that only grouping and connectivity graphs used in this study, which limits the number to five for AI2D-RST.\nThe same features are used for both AI2D and AI2D-RST for nodes with layout information, namely text, graphics, arrows and arrowheads (in AI2D only). The position, size and shape of each diagram element are described using the following features: (1) the centre point of the bounding box or polygon, divided by the height and width of the diagram image, (2) area, or the number of pixels within the polygon, divided by the total number of pixels in the image, and (3) the solidity of the polygon, or the polygon area divided by the area of its convex hull. This yields a 4-dimensional feature vector describing the position and size of each diagram element in the layout. Each dimension is set to zero for grouping nodes in AI2D-RST and image constant nodes in AI2D and AI2D-RST.\nAI2D-RST models discourse relations using nodes, which have a 25-dimensional, one-hot encoded feature vector to represent the type of discourse relation, which are drawn from Rhetorical Structure Theory BIBREF21. In AI2D, the discourse relations derived from engelhardt2002 are represented using a 10-dimensional one-hot encoded vector, which is associated with edges connecting diagram elements participating in the relation. Because the two resources draw on different theories and represent discourse relations differently, I use the grouping and connectivity graph for AI2D-RST representations and ignore the edge features in AI2D, as these descriptions attempt to describe roughly the same multimodal structures. A comparison of discourse relations is left for a follow-up study focusing on representing the discourse structure of diagrams.\nWhereas AI2D encodes information about semantic relations using edges, in AI2D-RST the information carried by edges depends on the graph in question. The edges of the grouping graph do not have features, whereas the edges of the connectivity graph have a 3-dimensional, one-hot encoded vector that represents the type of connection. The edges of the discourse structure graph have a 2-dimensional, one-hot encoded feature vector to represent nuclearity, that is, whether the nodes that participate in a discourse relations act as nuclei or satellites.\nFor the experiments reported in Section 4, self-loops are added to each node in the graph. A self-loop is an edge that originates in and terminates at the same node. Self-loops essentially add the graph's identity matrix to the adjacency matrix, which allow the graph neural networks to account for the node's own features during message passing, that is, when sending and receiving features from adjacent nodes.\nThis section presents two experiments that compare AI2D and AI2D-RST annotations in classifying diagrams and their parts using various graph neural networks.\nI evaluated the following graph neural network architectures for both graph and node classification tasks:\nGraph Convolutional Network (GCN) BIBREF25\nSimplifying Graph Convolution (SGC) BIBREF26, averaging incoming node features from up to 2 hops away\nGraph Attention Network (GAT) BIBREF27 with 2 heads\nGraphSAGE (SAGE) BIBREF28 with LSTM aggregation\nI implemented all graph neural networks using Deep Graph Library 0.4 BIBREF29 on the PyTorch 1.3 backend BIBREF30.

This is an interesting finding, as many diagram types differ in terms of their connectivity structures (e.g. cycles and networks) BIBREF11. The edges introduced from the connectivity graph naturally increase the flow of information in the graph, but this does not seem to help learn distinctive features between diagram types. On the other hand, it should be noted that the nodes are not typed, that is, the model cannot distinguish between edges from the grouping and connectivity graphs.\nOverall, the macro F1 scores for both AI2D and AI2D-RST, which assigns equal weight to all classes regardless of the number of samples, underline the challenge of training classifiers using limited data with imbalanced classes. The lack of visual features may also affect overall classification performance: certain fine-grained classes, which are also prominent in the data, such as 2D cross-sections and 3D cut-outs, may have similar graph-based representations. Extracting visual features from diagram images may help to discern between diagrams whose graphs bear close resemblance to one another, but this would require advanced object detectors for non-photographic images.\nThe results for AI2D-RST show that the grouping graph, which represents visual perceptual groups of diagram elements and their hierarchical organisation, provides a robust foundation for describing the spatial organisation of diagrammatic representations. This kind of generic schema can be expanded beyond diagrams to other modes of expression that make use of the spatial extent, such as entire page layouts. A description of how the layout space is used can be incorporated into any effort to model discourse relations that may hold between the groups or their parts.\nThe promising results AI2D-RST suggest is that domain experts in multimodal communication should be involved in planning crowd-sourced annotation tasks right from the beginning. Segmentation, in particular, warrants attention as this phase defines the units of analysis: cut-outs and cross-sections, for instance, use labels and lines to pick out sub-regions of graphical objects, whereas in illustrations the labels often refer to entire objects. Such distinctions should preferably be picked out at the very beginning to be incorporated fully into the annotation schema.\nTasks related to grouping and connectivity annotation could be crowd-sourced relatively easily, whereas annotating diagram types and discourse relations may require multi-step procedures and assistance in the form of prompts, as yungetal2019 have recently shown for RST. Involving both expert and crowd-sourced annotators could also alleviate problems related to circularity by forcing domain experts to frame the tasks in terms understandable to crowd-sourced workers BIBREF24.\nIn light of the results for graph classification, one should note that node features are averaged before classification regardless of their connections in the graph. Whereas the expert-annotated grouping graph in AI2D-RST has been pruned from isolated nodes, which ensures that features are propagated to neighbouring nodes, the crowd-sourced AI2D graphs contain both isolated nodes and subgraphs. To what extent these disconnections affect the performance for AI2D warrant a separate study. Additionally, more advanced techniques than mere averaging, such as pooling, should be explored in future work.\nFinally, there are many aspects of diagrammatic representation that were not explored in this study. To begin with, a comparison of representations for discourse structures using the question-answering set accompanying AI2D would be particularly interesting, especially if both AI2D and AI2D-RST graphs were enriched with features from state of the art semantic representations for natural language and graphic elements.\nIn this article, I compared graph-based representations of diagrams representing primary school science topics from two datasets that contain the same diagrams, which have been annotated by either crowd-sourced workers or trained experts. The comparison involved two tasks, graph and node classification, using four different architectures for graph neural networks, which were compared to baselines from dummy, random forest and support vector machine classifiers.\nThe results showed that graph neural networks can learn to accurately identify diagram elements from their size, shape and position in layout. These node representations could then be used as features for graph classification. Identifying diagrams, either in terms of what they represent (semantic content) or how (abstract diagram type), proved more challenging using the graph-based representations. Improving accuracy may require additional features that capture visual properties of the diagrams, as these distinctions cannot be captured by graph-based representations and features focusing on layout.\nOverall, the results nevertheless suggest that simple layout features can provide a foundation for representing diagrammatic structures, which use the layout space to organise the content and set up discourse relations between different elements. To what extent these layout features can support the prediction of actual discourse relations should be explored in future research.", "question": "What platform do the crowd-sourced workers come from?", "expected_output": "Amazon Mechanical Turk.

{"id": "1912.02866", "prompt": "Diagrams are a common feature of many everyday media from newspapers to school textbooks, and not surprisingly, different forms of diagrammatic representation have been studied from various perspectives. To name just a few examples, recent work has examined patterns in diagram design BIBREF0 and their interpretation in context BIBREF1, and developed frameworks for classifying diagrams BIBREF2 and proposed guidelines for their design BIBREF3. There is also a long-standing interest in processing and generating diagrams computationally BIBREF4, BIBREF5, BIBREF6, which is now resurfacing as advances emerging from deep learning for computer vision and natural language processing are brought to bear on diagrammatic representations BIBREF7, BIBREF8, BIBREF9.\nFrom the perspective of computational processing, diagrammatic representations present a formidable challenge, as they involve tasks from both computer vision and natural language processing. On the one hand, diagrams have a spatial organisation \u2013 layout \u2013 which needs to be segmented to identify meaningful units and their position. Making sense of how diagrams exploit the 2D layout space falls arguably within the domain of computer vision. On the other hand, diagrams also have a discourse structure, which uses the layout space to set up discourse relations between instances of natural language, various types of images, arrows and lines, thus forming a unified discourse organisation. The need to parse this discourse structure shifts the focus towards the field of natural language processing.\nUnderstanding and making inferences about the structure of diagrams and other forms of multimodal discourse may be broadly conceptualised as multimodal discourse parsing. Recent examples of work in this area include alikhanietal2019 and ottoetal2019, who model discourse relations between natural language and photographic images, drawing on linguistic theories of coherence and text\u2013image relations, respectively. In most cases, however, predicting a single discourse relation covers only a part of the discourse structure. sachanetal2019 note that there is a need for comprehensive theories and models of multimodal communication, as they can be used to rethink tasks that have been previously considered only from the perspective of natural language processing.\nUnlike many other areas, the study of diagrammatic representations is particularly well-resourced, as several multimodal resources have been published recently to support research on computational processing of diagrams BIBREF10, BIBREF8, BIBREF11. This study compares two such resources, AI2D BIBREF10 and AI2D-RST BIBREF11, which both feature the same diagrams, as the latter is an extension of the former. Whereas AI2D features crowd-sourced, non-expert annotations, AI2D-RST provides multiple layers of expert annotations, which are informed by state-of-the-art approaches to multimodal communication BIBREF12 and annotation BIBREF13, BIBREF14.\nThis provides an interesting setting for comparison and evaluation, as non-expert annotations are cheap to produce and easily outnumber the expert-annotated data, whose production consumes both time and resources. Expert annotations, however, incorporate domain knowledge from multimodality theory, which is unavailable via crowd-sourcing. Whether expert annotations provide better representations of diagrammatic structures and thus justify their higher cost is one question that this study seeks to answer.\nBoth AI2D and AI2D-RST represent the multimodal structure of diagrams using graphs. This enables learning their representations using graph neural networks, which are gaining currency as a graph is a natural choice for representing many types of data BIBREF15. This article reports on two experiments that evaluate the capability of AI2D and AI2D-RST to represent the multimodal structure of diagrams using graphs, focusing particularly on spatial layout, the hierarchical organisation of diagram elements and their connections expressed using arrows and lines.\nThis section introduces the two multimodal resources compared in this study and discusses related work, beginning with the crowd-sourced annotations in AI2D and continuing with the alternative expert annotations in AI2D-RST, which are built on top of the crowd-sourced descriptions and cover a 1000-diagram subset of the original data. Figure FIGREF1 provides an overview of the two datasets, explains their relation to each other and provides an overview of the experiments reported in Section SECREF4\nThe Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence Diagrams dataset (AI2D) contains 4903 English-language diagrams, which represent topics in primary school natural sciences, such as food webs, human physiology and life cycles, amounting to a total of 17 classes BIBREF10. The dataset was originally developed to support research on diagram understanding and visual question answering BIBREF16, but has also been used to study the contextual interpretation of diagrammatic elements, such as arrows and lines BIBREF17.\nThe AI2D annotation schema models four types of diagram elements: text, graphics, arrows and arrowheads, whereas the semantic relations that hold between these elements are described using ten relations from a framework for analysing diagrammatic representations in engelhardt2002. Each diagram is represented using a Diagram Parse Graph (DPG), whose nodes stand for diagram elements while the edges between the nodes carry information about their semantic relations. The annotation for AI2D, which includes layout segmentations for the diagram images, DPGs and a multiple choice question-answer set, was created by crowd-sourced non-expert annotators on Amazon Mechanical Turk BIBREF10.\nI have previously argued that describing different types of multimodal structures in diagrammatic representations requires different types of graphs BIBREF18. To exemplify, many forms of multimodal discourse are assumed to possess a hierarchical structure, whose representation requires a tree graph. Diagrams, however, use arrows and lines to draw connections between elements that are not necessarily part of the same subtree, and for this reason representing connectivity requires a cyclic graph. AI2D DPGs, in turn, conflate the description of semantic relations and connections expressed using diagrammatic elements. Whether computational modelling of diagrammatic structures, or more generally, multimodal discourse parsing, benefits from pulling apart different types of multimodal structure remains an open question, which we pursued by developing an alternative annotation schema for AI2D, named AI2D-RST, which is introduced below.\nAI2D-RST covers a subset of 1000 diagrams from AI2D, which have been annotated by trained experts using a new multi-layer annotation schema for describing the diagrams in AI2D BIBREF11. The annotation schema, which draws on state-of-the-art theories of multimodal communication BIBREF12, adopts a stand-off approach to describing the diagrams. Hence the three annotation layers in AI2D-RST are represented using three different graphs, which use the same identifiers for nodes across all three graphs to allow combining the descriptions in different graphs. AI2D-RST contains three graphs:\nGrouping: A tree graph that groups together diagram elements that are likely to be visually perceived as belonging together, based loosely on Gestalt principles of visual perception BIBREF19. These groups are organised into a hierarchy, which represents the organisation of content in the 2D layout space BIBREF13, BIBREF14.\nConnectivity: A cyclic graph representing connections between diagram elements or their groups, which are signalled using arrows or lines BIBREF20.\nDiscourse structure: A tree graph representing discourse structure of the diagram using Rhetorical Structure Theory BIBREF21, BIBREF22: hence the name AI2D-RST.\nThe grouping graph, which is initially populated by diagram elements from the AI2D layout segmentation, provides a foundation for describing connectivity and discourse structure by adding nodes to the grouping graph that stand for groups of diagram elements, as shown in the upper part of Figure FIGREF1. In addition, the grouping graph includes annotations for 11 different diagram types identified in the data (e.g. cycles, cross-sections and networks), which may be used as target labels during training, as explained in Section SECREF26 The coarse and fine-grained diagram types identified in the data are shown in Figure FIGREF8.\nhiippalaetal2019-ai2d show that the proposed annotation schema can be reliably applied to the data by measuring inter-annotator agreement between five annotators on random samples from the AI2D-RST corpus using Fleiss' $\\kappa $ BIBREF23. The results show high agreement on grouping ($N = 256, \\kappa = 0.84$), diagram types ($N = 119, \\kappa = 0.78$), connectivity ($N = 239, \\kappa = 0.88$) and discourse structure ($N = 227, \\kappa = 0.73$). It should be noted, however, that these measures may be affected by implicit knowledge that tends to develop among expert annotators who work towards the same task BIBREF24.\nBoth AI2D and AI2D-RST use graphs to represent the multimodal structure of diagrams. This section explicates how the graphs and their node and edge types differ across the two multimodal resources.\nAI2D and AI2D-RST share most node types that represent different diagram elements, namely text, graphics, arrows and the image constant, which is a node that stands for the entire diagram. In AI2D, generic diagram elements such as titles describing the entire diagram are typically connected to the image constant. In AI2D-RST, the image constant acts as the root node of the tree in the grouping graph. In addition to text, graphics, arrows and the image constant, AI2D-RST features two additional node types for groups and discourse relations, whereas AI2D includes an additional node for arrowheads. To summarise, AI2D contains five distinct node types, whereas AI2D-RST has six. Note, however, that only grouping and connectivity graphs used in this study, which limits the number to five for AI2D-RST.\nThe same features are used for both AI2D and AI2D-RST for nodes with layout information, namely text, graphics, arrows and arrowheads (in AI2D only). The position, size and shape of each diagram element are described using the following features: (1) the centre point of the bounding box or polygon, divided by the height and width of the diagram image, (2) area, or the number of pixels within the polygon, divided by the total number of pixels in the image, and (3) the solidity of the polygon, or the polygon area divided by the area of its convex hull. This yields a 4-dimensional feature vector describing the position and size of each diagram element in the layout. Each dimension is set to zero for grouping nodes in AI2D-RST and image constant nodes in AI2D and AI2D-RST.\nAI2D-RST models discourse relations using nodes, which have a 25-dimensional, one-hot encoded feature vector to represent the type of discourse relation, which are drawn from Rhetorical Structure Theory BIBREF21. In AI2D, the discourse relations derived from engelhardt2002 are represented using a 10-dimensional one-hot encoded vector, which is associated with edges connecting diagram elements participating in the relation. Because the two resources draw on different theories and represent discourse relations differently, I use the grouping and connectivity graph for AI2D-RST representations and ignore the edge features in AI2D, as these descriptions attempt to describe roughly the same multimodal structures. A comparison of discourse relations is left for a follow-up study focusing on representing the discourse structure of diagrams.\nWhereas AI2D encodes information about semantic relations using edges, in AI2D-RST the information carried by edges depends on the graph in question. The edges of the grouping graph do not have features, whereas the edges of the connectivity graph have a 3-dimensional, one-hot encoded vector that represents the type of connection. The edges of the discourse structure graph have a 2-dimensional, one-hot encoded feature vector to represent nuclearity, that is, whether the nodes that participate in a discourse relations act as nuclei or satellites.\nFor the experiments reported in Section 4, self-loops are added to each node in the graph. A self-loop is an edge that originates in and terminates at the same node. Self-loops essentially add the graph's identity matrix to the adjacency matrix, which allow the graph neural networks to account for the node's own features during message passing, that is, when sending and receiving features from adjacent nodes.\nThis section presents two experiments that compare AI2D and AI2D-RST annotations in classifying diagrams and their parts using various graph neural networks.\nI evaluated the following graph neural network architectures for both graph and node classification tasks:\nGraph Convolutional Network (GCN) BIBREF25\nSimplifying Graph Convolution (SGC) BIBREF26, averaging incoming node features from up to 2 hops away\nGraph Attention Network (GAT) BIBREF27 with 2 heads\nGraphSAGE (SAGE) BIBREF28 with LSTM aggregation\nI implemented all graph neural networks using Deep Graph Library 0.4 BIBREF29 on the PyTorch 1.3 backend BIBREF30. For GCN, GAT and SAGE, each network consists of two of the aforementioned layers with a Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation, followed by a dense layer and a final softmax function for predicting class membership probabilities. For SGC, the network consists of a single SGC layer without an activation function. The implementations for each network are available in the repository associated with this article.\nI used the Tree of Parzen Estimators (TPE) algorithm BIBREF31 to tune model hyperparameters separately for each dataset, architecture and task using the implementation in the Tune BIBREF32 and hyperopt BIBREF33 libraries. For each dataset, architecture and task, I evaluated a total of 100 hyperparameter combinations for a maximum of 100 epochs, using 850 diagrams for training and 150 for validation. The objective metric to be maximised was macro F1 score. Tables TABREF20 and TABREF21 give the hyperparameters and spaces searched for node and graph classification. Following shcuretal2018, I shuffled the training and validation splits for each run to prevent overfitting and used the same training procedure throughout. I used the Adam optimiser BIBREF34 for both hyperparameter search and training.\nTo address the issue of class imbalance present in both tasks, class weights were calculated by dividing the total number of samples by the product of the number of unique classes and the number of samples for each class, as implemented in scikit-learn BIBREF35. These weights were passed to the loss function during hyperparameter search and training.\nAfter hyperparameter optimisation, I trained each model with the best hyperparameter combination for 20 runs, using 850 diagrams for training, 75 for validation and 75 for testing, shuffling the splits for each run while monitoring performance on the evaluation set and stopping training early if the macro F1 score failed to improve over 15 epochs for graph classification or over 25 epochs for node classification. I then evaluated the model on the testing set and recorded the result.\nThe purpose of the node classification task is to evaluate how well algorithms learn to classify the parts of a diagram using the graph-based representations in AI2D and AI2D-RST and node features representing the position, size and shape of the element, as described in Section SECREF11 Identifying the correct node type is a key step when populating a graph with candidate nodes from object detectors, particularly if the nodes will be processed further, for instance, to extract semantic representations from CNN features or word embeddings. Furthermore, the node representations learned during this task can be used as node features for graph classification, as will be shown shortly below in Section SECREF26\nTable TABREF25 presents a baseline for node classification from a dummy classifier, together with results for random forest and support vector machine classifiers trained on 850 and tested on 150 diagrams. Both AI2D and AI2D-RST include five node types, of which four are the same: the difference is that whereas AI2D includes arrowheads, AI2D-RST includes nodes for groups of diagram elements, as outlined in Section SECREF9 The results seem to reflect the fact that image constants and grouping nodes have their features set to zero, and RF and SVM cannot leverage features incoming from their neighbouring nodes to learn node representations. This is likely to affect the result for AI2D-RST, which includes 7300 grouping nodes that are used to create a hierarchy of diagram elements.\nTable TABREF22 shows the results for node classification using various graph neural network architectures. Because the results are not entirely comparable due to different node types present in the two resources, it is more reasonable to compare architectures. SAGE, GCN and GAT clearly outperform SGC in classifying nodes from both resources, as does the random forest classifier. AI2D nodes are classified with particularly high accuracy, which may result from having to learn representations for only one node type, that is, the image constant ($N = 1000$). AI2D-RST, in turn, must learn representations from scratch for both image constants ($N = 1000$) and grouping nodes ($N = 7300$).\nBecause SAGE learns useful node representations for both resources, as reflected in high performance for all metrics, I chose this architecture for extracting node features for graph classification.\nThis task compares the performance of graph-based representations in AI2D and AI2D-RST for classifying entire diagrams. Here the aim is to evaluate to what extent graph neural networks can learn about the generic structure of primary school science diagrams from the graph-based representations in AI2D and AI2D-RST. Correctly identifying what the diagram attempts to communicate and how carries implications for tasks such as visual question answering, as the type of a diagram constrains the interpretation of key diagrammatic elements, such as the meaning of lines and arrows BIBREF1, BIBREF17.\nTo enable a fair comparison, the target classes are derived from both AI2D and AI2D-RST. Whereas AI2D includes 17 classes that represent the semantic content of diagrams, as exemplified by categories such as `parts of the Earth', `volcano', and `food chains and webs', AI2D-RST classifies diagrams into abstract diagram types, such as cycles, networks, cross-sections and cut-outs. More specifically, AI2D-RST provides classes for diagram types at two levels of granularity, fine-grained (12 classes) and coarse (5 classes), which are derived from the proposed schema for diagram types in AI2D-RST BIBREF11.\nThe 11 fine-grained classes in AI2D-RST shown in Figure FIGREF8 are complemented by an additional class (`mixed'), which includes diagrams that combine multiple diagram types, whose inclusion avoids performing multi-label classification (see the example in Figure FIGREF28). The coarse classes, which are derived by grouping fine-grained classes for tables, tabular and spatial organisations, networks and cycles, diagrammatic and pictorial representations, and so on, are also complemented by a `mixed' class.\nFor this task, the node features consist of the representations learned during node classification in Section SECREF24 These representations are extracted by feeding the features representing node position, size and shape to the graph neural network, which in both cases uses the GraphSAGE architecture BIBREF28, and recording the output of the final softmax activation. Compared to a one-hot encoding, representing node identity using a probability distribution from a softmax activation reduces the sparsity of the feature vector. This yields a 5-dimensional feature vector for each node.\nTable TABREF29 provides a baseline for graph classification from a dummy classifier, as well as results for random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM) classifiers trained on 850 and tested on 150 diagrams. The macro F1 scores show that the RF classifier with 100 decision trees offers competitive performance for all target classes and both AI2D and AI2D-RST, in some cases outperforming graph neural networks. It should be noted, however, that the RF classifier is trained with node features learned using GraphSAGE.\nThe results for graph classification using graph neural networks presented in Table TABREF27 show certain differences between AI2D and AI2D-RST. When classifying diagrams into the original semantic categories defined in AI2D ($N = 17$), the AI2D graphs significantly outperform AI2D-RST when using the GraphSAGE architecture. For all other graph neural networks, the differences between AI2D and AI2D-RST are not statistically significant. This is not surprising as the AI2D graphs were tailored for the original classes, yet the AI2D-RST graphs seem to capture generic properties that help to classify diagrams into semantic categories nearly as accurately as AI2D graphs designed specifically for this purpose, although no semantic features apart from the layout structure are provided to the classifier.\nThe situation is reversed for the coarse ($N = 5$) and fine-grained ($N = 12$) classes from AI2D-RST, in which the AI2D-RST graphs generally outperform AI2D, except for coarse classification using SGC. This classification task obviously benefits AI2D-RST, whose classification schema was originally designed for abstract diagram types. This may also suggest that the AI2D graphs do not capture regularities that would support learning to generalise about diagram types. The situation is somewhat different for fine-grained classification, in which the differences in performance are relatively small.\nGenerally, most architectures do not benefit from combining the grouping and connectivity graphs in AI2D-RST. This is an interesting finding, as many diagram types differ in terms of their connectivity structures (e.g. cycles and networks) BIBREF11. The edges introduced from the connectivity graph naturally increase the flow of information in the graph, but this does not seem to help learn distinctive features between diagram types. On the other hand, it should be noted that the nodes are not typed, that is, the model cannot distinguish between edges from the grouping and connectivity graphs.\nOverall, the macro F1 scores for both AI2D and AI2D-RST, which assigns equal weight to all classes regardless of the number of samples, underline the challenge of training classifiers using limited data with imbalanced classes. The lack of visual features may also affect overall classification performance: certain fine-grained classes, which are also prominent in the data, such as 2D cross-sections and 3D cut-outs, may have similar graph-based representations. Extracting visual features from diagram images may help to discern between diagrams whose graphs bear close resemblance to one another, but this would require advanced object detectors for non-photographic images.\nThe results for AI2D-RST show that the grouping graph, which represents visual perceptual groups of diagram elements and their hierarchical organisation, provides a robust foundation for describing the spatial organisation of diagrammatic representations. This kind of generic schema can be expanded beyond diagrams to other modes of expression that make use of the spatial extent, such as entire page layouts. A description of how the layout space is used can be incorporated into any effort to model discourse relations that may hold between the groups or their parts.\nThe promising results AI2D-RST suggest is that domain experts in multimodal communication should be involved in planning crowd-sourced annotation tasks right from the beginning.

Such distinctions should preferably be picked out at the very beginning to be incorporated fully into the annotation schema.\nTasks related to grouping and connectivity annotation could be crowd-sourced relatively easily, whereas annotating diagram types and discourse relations may require multi-step procedures and assistance in the form of prompts, as yungetal2019 have recently shown for RST. Involving both expert and crowd-sourced annotators could also alleviate problems related to circularity by forcing domain experts to frame the tasks in terms understandable to crowd-sourced workers BIBREF24.\nIn light of the results for graph classification, one should note that node features are averaged before classification regardless of their connections in the graph. Whereas the expert-annotated grouping graph in AI2D-RST has been pruned from isolated nodes, which ensures that features are propagated to neighbouring nodes, the crowd-sourced AI2D graphs contain both isolated nodes and subgraphs.

{"id": "1812.00382", "prompt": "Controversy detection is an increasingly important task. Controversial content can signal the need for moderation on social platforms, either to prevent conflict between users or limit the spread of misinformation. More generally, controversies provide insight into societies BIBREF0 . Often, the controversial content is outside the direct control of a platform on which it is shared, mentioned or discussed. This raises the requirement of generally applicable methods to gauge controversial content on the web for moderation purposes. Unfortunately, what is controversial changes, and may lie more in the way topics are discussed rather than what is discussed, making it difficult to detect controversies in a robust fashion. We take the task of controversy detection and evaluate robustness of different methodologies with respect to the varying nature of controversies.\nPrior work on detecting controversies has taken three kinds of approaches: 1) lexical approaches, which seek to detect controversies through signal terms, either through bag-of-word classifiers, lexicons, or lexicon based language models BIBREF1 . 2) explicit modeling of controversy through platform-specific features, often in Wikipedia or social-media settings. Features such as mutual reverts BIBREF2 , user-provided flags BIBREF3 , interaction networks BIBREF4 or stance-distributions BIBREF5 have been used as platform-specific indicators of controversies. The downside of these approaches is the lack of generalizability due to their platform-specific nature. 3) matching models that combine lexical and explicit modelling approaches by looking at lexical similarities between a given text and a set of texts in a domain that provides explicit features BIBREF1 , BIBREF6 , BIBREF7 .\nControversy detection is a difficult task because 1) controversies are latent, like ideology, meaning they are often not directly mentioned as controversial in text. 2) Controversies occur across a vast range of topics with varying topic-specific vocabularies. 3) Controversies change over time, with some topics and actors becoming controversial whereas others stop to be so. Previous approaches lack the power to deal with such changes. Matching and explicit approaches are problematic when the source corpus (e.g. Wikipedia) lags after real-world changes BIBREF8 . Furthermore, lexical methods trained on common (e.g. fulltext) features are likely to memorize the controversial topics in the training set rather than the `language of controversy'. Alleviating dependence on platform specific features and reducing sensitivity to an exact lexical representation is paramount to robust controversy detection. To this end, we focus only on fulltext features and suggest to leverage the semantic representations of word embeddings to reduce the vocabulary-gap for unseen topics and exact lexical representations.\nThe majority of NLP-task related neural architectures rely on word embeddings, popularized by Mikolov et al BIBREF9 to represent texts. In essence these embeddings are latent-vector representations that aim to capture the underlying meaning of words. Distances between such latent-vectors are taken to express semantic relatedness, despite having different surface forms. By using embeddings, neural architectures are also able to leverage features learned on other texts (e.g. pretrained word embeddings) and create higher level representations of input (e.g. convolutional feature maps or hidden-states). These properties suggest that neural approaches are better able to generalize to unseen examples that poorly match the training set. We use two often applied network architectures adopting word embeddings, to classify controversy: Recurrent Neural Networks BIBREF10 and Convolutional Neural Networks BIBREF11 to answer the following research question. RQ: Can we increase robustness of controversy detection using neural methods?\nCurrently, there is no open large-size controversy detection dataset that lends itself to test cross-temporal and cross-topic stability. Thus we generate a Wikipedia crawl-based dataset that includes general web pages and is sufficiently large to train and test high capacity models such as neural networks.\nA proven approach in modelling text with neural networks is to use Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) which enjoy weight sharing capabilities to model words irrespective of their sequence location. A specific type, the Hierarchical Attention Network (HAN) proposed by BIBREF10 makes use of attention to build document representations in a hierarchical manner. It uses bi-directional Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) BIBREF12 to selectively update representations of both words and sentences. This allows the network to both capture the hierarchy from words to sentences to documents and to explicitly weigh all parts of the document relevant during inference.\nRecently, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have enjoyed increasing success in text classification. One such network introduced by BIBREF11 looks at patterns in words within a window, such as \"Scientology [...] brainwashes people\". The occurrences of these patterns are then summarized to their 'strongest' observation (max-pooling) and used for classification. Since pooling is applied after each convolution, the output size of each convolutional operation itself is irrelevant. Therefore, filters of different sizes can be used, each capturing patterns in different sized word windows.\nWe explore the potential of RNNs and CNNs for controversy detection using both the HAN BIBREF10 and the CNN BIBREF11 model. Similar to BIBREF10 , each bi-directional GRU cell is set to a dimension of 50, resulting in a word/sentence representation of size 100 after concatenation. The word/sentence attention vectors similarly contain 100 dimensions, all randomly initialized. The word windows defined in the CNN model are set to sizes: 2, 3 and 4 with 128 feature maps each. Each model is trained using mini batches of size 64 and uses both dropout (0.5) and INLINEFORM0 regularization (1e-3) at the dense prediction layer. Both networks use pre-trained embeddings, trained on 100 billion words of a Google News corpus, which are further fine-tuned during training on the controversy dataset. The optimization algorithm used is Adam BIBREF13 (learning rate: 1e-3).\nWe use the Clueweb09 derived dataset of BIBREF0 for baseline comparison. For cross-temporal, cross-topic and cross-domain training & evaluation, we generate a new dataset based on Wikipedia crawl data. This dataset is gathered by using Wikipedia's `List of Contoversial articles' overview page of 2018 (time of writing) and 2009 (for comparison with baselines) . Using this as a `seed' set of controversial articles, we iteratively crawl the `See also', `References' and `External links' hyperlinks up to two hops from the seed list. The negative seed pages (i.e. non controversial) are gathered by using the random article endpoint. The snowball-sample approach includes general, non-Wikipedia, pages that are referred to from Wikipedia pages. The dataset thus extends beyond just the encyclopedia genre of texts. Labels are assumed to propagate: a page linked from a controversial issue is assumed to be controversial. The resulting dataset statistics are summarized in Table TABREF7 .\nTo be useful as a flagging mechanism for moderation, a controversy detection algorithm should satisfy both Precision and Recall criteria. F1 scores will therefore be used to evaluate this balance. The AUC values are used to measure classification performance in the unbalanced controversy datasets. The test-train split depends on the task investigated and is listed in the results section for the respective task. To test for significant results, all models were evaluated using a bootstrap approach: by drawing 1000 samples with replacements INLINEFORM0 documents from the test set equal to the test-set size. The resulting confidence intervals based on percentiles provide a measure of significance.\nTo compare the results of neural approaches to prior work we implemented the previous state-of-the-art controversy detection method: the language model from BIBREF7 . Together with an SVM baseline they act as controversy detection alternatives using only full text features, thus meeting the task-requirements of platform-independence. Note: the implementation of BIBREF7 additionally requires ranking methods to select a subset of the training data for each language model. A simplified version of this, excluding the ranking method but using the same dataset and lexicon to select documents as BIBREF7 , is implemented and included in the baselines comparison section (LM-DBPedia). We also included the same language model trained on the full text Wikipedia pages (LM-wiki). Similarly, for completeness sake, we also include both the state-of-the-art matching model, the TILE-Clique model from BIBREF1 and the sentiment analysis baseline (using the state-of-the-art Polyglot library for python) from BIBREF6 in the comparison with previous work.\nTable TABREF13 shows the relative performance of the neural models compared to previous controversy detection methods, evaluated on the Clueweb09 derived dataset of BIBREF6 and trained on the Wikipedia data from the same time frame. The TILE-Clique matching model outperforms all other models on Precision although this difference is not significant compared to the neural approaches. Similarly, the language model trained on the DBPedia dataset outperforms other models on Recall but shows no significant difference compared to the CNN model. Notably, the neural approaches show comparable results to the TILE-Clique model in terms of F1, demonstrating a balanced performance in terms of Precision and Recall. Furthermore, the CNN model shows a significant improvement compared to the other non neural baselines in terms of the AUC value (p < 0.05).\nControversy is expected to change over time. Some issues become controversial, others cease to be so. To investigate robustness of controversy detection models with respect to changes over time, we evaluate model performance in two variants: trained and tested on 2018, or trained on the 2009 Wikipedia data and tested on the 2018 Wikipedia data. Table 3 shows the results for each of the text-based detection models.\nWithin year, the hierarchical attention model (HAN) outperforms all other models on Recall, F1 and AUC, losing Precision to the CNN and SVM models. However, our main interest is the robustness when a model is trained on a different year (2009) than the test set (2018). These between year experiments show a superior score for the HAN model compared to the non-neural models on Recall, and show significant improvements on F1 (p < 0.05) and AUC (p < 0.05), losing only to the SVM model on Precision (non significantly). In terms of robustness, we can also take the percentage change between the within year and between year experiment into account (were smaller absolute changes are preferable), shown by the delta values. With regard to temporal sensitivity, the CNN shows the least change across all four metrics. In Figure 1, we show the pooled results for the lexical and neural models to illustrate the overall increase in robustness by neural approaches.\nInterestingly, the SVM and HAN model show some unexpected improvement with regard to Precision when applied to unseen timeframes. For both models, this increase in Precision is offset by a greater loss in Recall, which seems to indicate both models `memorize` the controversial topics in a given timeframe instead of the controversial language. Overall, the neural approaches seem to compare favorably in terms of cross-temporal stability.\nTo evaluate robustness towards unseen topics, 10-fold cross validation was used on the top ten largest topics present in the Wikipedia dataset in a leave-one-out fashion. The results are shown in table 4. In line with previous results, the language model scores best on Recall, beating all other models with a significant difference (p < 0.01). However in balancing Recall with Precision, the HAN model scores best, significantly outperforming both lexical models in F1 score (p < 0.05). Overall, when grouping together all neural and lexical results, the neural methods outperform the lexical models in Precision (p < 0.01), F1 (p < 0.05) and AUC (p < 0.01) with no significant difference found on the overall Recall scores. These results indicate that neural methods seem better able to generalize to unseen topics.\nMost work on controversy has looked into using existing knowledge bases as a source of controversy information BIBREF6 , BIBREF1 . In this paper, we focus on text-based classification methods that do not aim to explicitly link general web pages to their knowledge-base counterparts. Therefore, we are interested in the ability of neural models to generalize beyond their training context. In addition to testing across time and topics, we also investigate robustness to changes in domain. By training only on Wikipedia data, and evaluating only on general web-pages, we look at the ability of the four methods to deal with out-of-domain documents.\nThe hierarchical attention network shows significantly better results (p < 0.05) compared to all other models on F1. Both neural models also outperform both language models on AUC significantly (p < 0.05). Precision and Recall are more mixed, with the CNN and SVM outperforming the HAN on Precision and the language model -again- performing best in terms of Recall. Together, the neural methods seem to work best on three out of the four metrics.\nLastly, we examine model performance with respect to human annotation using the human annotated dataset of BIBREF6 . We assume that models that perform similarly to human annotators are preferable. In Table TABREF20 , we present three Spearman correlation metrics to express model congruence with human annotations. Mean annotation expresses the correlation of model error rates with the controversy values attributed to a web page by human annotators, with positive values expressing greater error rates on controversial, and negative expressing higher error rates on non-controversial pages. Here, the HAN shows most unbiased (closest to zero) performance.\nCertainty is the distance of human annotations to the midpoint of the four-point controversy scale, i.e. a score between 0 and 2.5 that expresses how sure annotators are of document (non)controversy. Here, the HAN shows errors most strongly negatively correlated to the certainty of annotators. Finally, annotators disagree on the controversy of some documents, expressed as the standard deviation of their controversy annotations. Again, the HAN model seems preferable, as it's errors are most strongly correlated to annotator disagreement. Overall, the neural methods have less biased performance in relation to (non)controversial documents, correlate more strongly with the certainty of human annotators and are susceptible to errors in similar conditions as when annotators disagree.\nControversy detection is a hard task, as it forms a latent concept sensitive to vocabulary gaps between topics and vocabulary shifts over time. We analysed the performance of language model, SVM, CNN and HAN models on different tasks.\nFirst, we have demonstrated that neural methods perform as state-of-the-art tools in controversy detection on the ClueWeb09 BIBREF0 based testset, even beating matching models. Second, we investigated temporal stability, and demonstrated neural -and especially CNN- robustness in terms of Recall, F1 and AUC performance and stability with train and test sets that are 9 years apart. Thirdly, we show that CNN and HAN models outperform the SVM and LM baselines on Precision, F1 and AUC when tested on held-out-topics. Fourthly, we show that neural methods are better able to generalize from Wikipedia pages to unseen general web pages in terms of Precision, F1 and AUC.

{"id": "1812.00382", "prompt": "Controversy detection is an increasingly important task. Controversial content can signal the need for moderation on social platforms, either to prevent conflict between users or limit the spread of misinformation. More generally, controversies provide insight into societies BIBREF0 . Often, the controversial content is outside the direct control of a platform on which it is shared, mentioned or discussed. This raises the requirement of generally applicable methods to gauge controversial content on the web for moderation purposes. Unfortunately, what is controversial changes, and may lie more in the way topics are discussed rather than what is discussed, making it difficult to detect controversies in a robust fashion. We take the task of controversy detection and evaluate robustness of different methodologies with respect to the varying nature of controversies.\nPrior work on detecting controversies has taken three kinds of approaches: 1) lexical approaches, which seek to detect controversies through signal terms, either through bag-of-word classifiers, lexicons, or lexicon based language models BIBREF1 . 2) explicit modeling of controversy through platform-specific features, often in Wikipedia or social-media settings. Features such as mutual reverts BIBREF2 , user-provided flags BIBREF3 , interaction networks BIBREF4 or stance-distributions BIBREF5 have been used as platform-specific indicators of controversies. The downside of these approaches is the lack of generalizability due to their platform-specific nature. 3) matching models that combine lexical and explicit modelling approaches by looking at lexical similarities between a given text and a set of texts in a domain that provides explicit features BIBREF1 , BIBREF6 , BIBREF7 .\nControversy detection is a difficult task because 1) controversies are latent, like ideology, meaning they are often not directly mentioned as controversial in text. 2) Controversies occur across a vast range of topics with varying topic-specific vocabularies. 3) Controversies change over time, with some topics and actors becoming controversial whereas others stop to be so. Previous approaches lack the power to deal with such changes. Matching and explicit approaches are problematic when the source corpus (e.g. Wikipedia) lags after real-world changes BIBREF8 . Furthermore, lexical methods trained on common (e.g. fulltext) features are likely to memorize the controversial topics in the training set rather than the `language of controversy'. Alleviating dependence on platform specific features and reducing sensitivity to an exact lexical representation is paramount to robust controversy detection. To this end, we focus only on fulltext features and suggest to leverage the semantic representations of word embeddings to reduce the vocabulary-gap for unseen topics and exact lexical representations.\nThe majority of NLP-task related neural architectures rely on word embeddings, popularized by Mikolov et al BIBREF9 to represent texts. In essence these embeddings are latent-vector representations that aim to capture the underlying meaning of words. Distances between such latent-vectors are taken to express semantic relatedness, despite having different surface forms. By using embeddings, neural architectures are also able to leverage features learned on other texts (e.g. pretrained word embeddings) and create higher level representations of input (e.g. convolutional feature maps or hidden-states). These properties suggest that neural approaches are better able to generalize to unseen examples that poorly match the training set. We use two often applied network architectures adopting word embeddings, to classify controversy: Recurrent Neural Networks BIBREF10 and Convolutional Neural Networks BIBREF11 to answer the following research question. RQ: Can we increase robustness of controversy detection using neural methods?\nCurrently, there is no open large-size controversy detection dataset that lends itself to test cross-temporal and cross-topic stability. Thus we generate a Wikipedia crawl-based dataset that includes general web pages and is sufficiently large to train and test high capacity models such as neural networks.\nA proven approach in modelling text with neural networks is to use Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) which enjoy weight sharing capabilities to model words irrespective of their sequence location. A specific type, the Hierarchical Attention Network (HAN) proposed by BIBREF10 makes use of attention to build document representations in a hierarchical manner. It uses bi-directional Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) BIBREF12 to selectively update representations of both words and sentences. This allows the network to both capture the hierarchy from words to sentences to documents and to explicitly weigh all parts of the document relevant during inference.\nRecently, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have enjoyed increasing success in text classification. One such network introduced by BIBREF11 looks at patterns in words within a window, such as \"Scientology [...] brainwashes people\". The occurrences of these patterns are then summarized to their 'strongest' observation (max-pooling) and used for classification. Since pooling is applied after each convolution, the output size of each convolutional operation itself is irrelevant. Therefore, filters of different sizes can be used, each capturing patterns in different sized word windows.\nWe explore the potential of RNNs and CNNs for controversy detection using both the HAN BIBREF10 and the CNN BIBREF11 model. Similar to BIBREF10 , each bi-directional GRU cell is set to a dimension of 50, resulting in a word/sentence representation of size 100 after concatenation.

Table 3 shows the results for each of the text-based detection models.\nWithin year, the hierarchical attention model (HAN) outperforms all other models on Recall, F1 and AUC, losing Precision to the CNN and SVM models. However, our main interest is the robustness when a model is trained on a different year (2009) than the test set (2018). These between year experiments show a superior score for the HAN model compared to the non-neural models on Recall, and show significant improvements on F1 (p < 0.05) and AUC (p < 0.05), losing only to the SVM model on Precision (non significantly). In terms of robustness, we can also take the percentage change between the within year and between year experiment into account (were smaller absolute changes are preferable), shown by the delta values. With regard to temporal sensitivity, the CNN shows the least change across all four metrics. In Figure 1, we show the pooled results for the lexical and neural models to illustrate the overall increase in robustness by neural approaches.\nInterestingly, the SVM and HAN model show some unexpected improvement with regard to Precision when applied to unseen timeframes. For both models, this increase in Precision is offset by a greater loss in Recall, which seems to indicate both models `memorize` the controversial topics in a given timeframe instead of the controversial language. Overall, the neural approaches seem to compare favorably in terms of cross-temporal stability.\nTo evaluate robustness towards unseen topics, 10-fold cross validation was used on the top ten largest topics present in the Wikipedia dataset in a leave-one-out fashion. The results are shown in table 4. In line with previous results, the language model scores best on Recall, beating all other models with a significant difference (p < 0.01). However in balancing Recall with Precision, the HAN model scores best, significantly outperforming both lexical models in F1 score (p < 0.05). Overall, when grouping together all neural and lexical results, the neural methods outperform the lexical models in Precision (p < 0.01), F1 (p < 0.05) and AUC (p < 0.01) with no significant difference found on the overall Recall scores. These results indicate that neural methods seem better able to generalize to unseen topics.\nMost work on controversy has looked into using existing knowledge bases as a source of controversy information BIBREF6 , BIBREF1 . In this paper, we focus on text-based classification methods that do not aim to explicitly link general web pages to their knowledge-base counterparts. Therefore, we are interested in the ability of neural models to generalize beyond their training context. In addition to testing across time and topics, we also investigate robustness to changes in domain. By training only on Wikipedia data, and evaluating only on general web-pages, we look at the ability of the four methods to deal with out-of-domain documents.\nThe hierarchical attention network shows significantly better results (p < 0.05) compared to all other models on F1. Both neural models also outperform both language models on AUC significantly (p < 0.05). Precision and Recall are more mixed, with the CNN and SVM outperforming the HAN on Precision and the language model -again- performing best in terms of Recall. Together, the neural methods seem to work best on three out of the four metrics.\nLastly, we examine model performance with respect to human annotation using the human annotated dataset of BIBREF6 . We assume that models that perform similarly to human annotators are preferable. In Table TABREF20 , we present three Spearman correlation metrics to express model congruence with human annotations. Mean annotation expresses the correlation of model error rates with the controversy values attributed to a web page by human annotators, with positive values expressing greater error rates on controversial, and negative expressing higher error rates on non-controversial pages. Here, the HAN shows most unbiased (closest to zero) performance.\nCertainty is the distance of human annotations to the midpoint of the four-point controversy scale, i.e. a score between 0 and 2.5 that expresses how sure annotators are of document (non)controversy. Here, the HAN shows errors most strongly negatively correlated to the certainty of annotators. Finally, annotators disagree on the controversy of some documents, expressed as the standard deviation of their controversy annotations. Again, the HAN model seems preferable, as it's errors are most strongly correlated to annotator disagreement. Overall, the neural methods have less biased performance in relation to (non)controversial documents, correlate more strongly with the certainty of human annotators and are susceptible to errors in similar conditions as when annotators disagree.\nControversy detection is a hard task, as it forms a latent concept sensitive to vocabulary gaps between topics and vocabulary shifts over time. We analysed the performance of language model, SVM, CNN and HAN models on different tasks.\nFirst, we have demonstrated that neural methods perform as state-of-the-art tools in controversy detection on the ClueWeb09 BIBREF0 based testset, even beating matching models. Second, we investigated temporal stability, and demonstrated neural -and especially CNN- robustness in terms of Recall, F1 and AUC performance and stability with train and test sets that are 9 years apart. Thirdly, we show that CNN and HAN models outperform the SVM and LM baselines on Precision, F1 and AUC when tested on held-out-topics. Fourthly, we show that neural methods are better able to generalize from Wikipedia pages to unseen general web pages in terms of Precision, F1 and AUC. Lastly, neural methods seem better in line with human annotators with regard to certainty and disagreement.", "question": "Which weak signal data do they use?", "expected_output": "semantic representations of word embeddings.

These models are typically trained only on sequences of words, ignoring the physical context in which the symbolic representations are grounded, or ignoring the social context that could inform the semantics of an utterance.\nFor incorporating additional modalities, the NLP community has typically used datasets such as MS COCO BIBREF1 and Flickr BIBREF2 for image-based tasks, while several datasets BIBREF3 , BIBREF4 , BIBREF5 , BIBREF6 , BIBREF7 have been curated for video-based tasks.

However, language grounding has focused more on obtaining better word and sentence representations or other downstream tasks, and to lesser extent on language modeling.\nIn this paper, we examine the problem of incorporating temporal visual context into a recurrent neural language model (RNNLM).

Using wordpieces allows us to address out-of-vocabulary (OOV) word issues that would arise from having a fixed word vocabulary.

{"id": "1911.04873", "prompt": "Neural networks (NNs) turned out to be very useful in several domains. In particular, one of the most spectacular advances achieved with use of NNs has been natural language processing. One of the tasks in this domain is translation between natural languages \u2013 neural machine translation (NMT) systems established here the state-of-the-art performance. Recently, NMT produced first encouraging results in the autoformalization task BIBREF0, BIBREF1, BIBREF2, BIBREF3 where given an informal mathematical text in the goal is to translate it to its formal (computer understandable) counterpart. In particular, the NMT performance on a large synthetic -to-Mizar dataset produced by a relatively sophisticated toolchain developed for several decades BIBREF4 is surprisingly good BIBREF3, indicating that neural networks can learn quite complicated algorithms for symbolic data. This inspired us to pose a question: Can NMT models be used in the formal-to-formal setting? In particular: Can NMT models learn symbolic rewriting?\nThe answer is relevant to various tasks in automated reasoning. For example, neural models could compete with symbolic methods such as inductive logic programming BIBREF5 (ILP) that have been previously experimented with to learn simple rewrite tasks and theorem-proving heuristics from large formal corpora BIBREF6. Unlike (early) ILP, neural methods can however easily cope with large and rich datasets, without combinatorial explosion.\nOur work is also an inquiry into the capabilities of NNs as such, in the spirit of works like BIBREF7.\nTo perform experiments answering our question we prepared two data sets \u2013 the first consists of examples extracted from proofs found by ATP (automated theorem prover) in a mathematical domain (AIM loops), whereas the second is a synthetic set of polynomial terms.\nThe data consists of sets of ground and nonground rewrites that came from Prover9 proofs of theorems about AIM loops produced by Veroff BIBREF8.\nMany of the inferences in the proofs are paramodulations from an equation and have the form s = t\nu[(s)] = vu[(t)] = v where $s, t, u, v$ are terms and $\\theta $ is a substitution. For the most common equations $s = t$, we gathered corresponding pairs of terms $\\big (u[\\theta (s)], u[\\theta (t)]\\big )$ which were rewritten from one to another with $s = t$. We put the pairs to separate data sets (depending on the corresponding $s = t$): in total 8 data sets for ground rewrites (where $\\theta $ is trivial) and 12 for nonground ones. The goal will be to learn rewriting for each of this 20 rules separately.\nTerms in the examples are treated as linear sequences of tokens where tokens are single symbols (variable / costant / predicate names, brackets, commas). Numbers of examples in each of the data sets vary between 251 and 34101. Lengths of the sequences of tokens vary between 1 and 343, with mean around 35. These 20 data sets were split into training, validation and test sets for our experiments ($60 \\%, 10 \\%, 30 \\%$, respectively).\nIn Table TABREF4 and Table TABREF5 there are presented examples of pairs of AIM terms in TPTP BIBREF9 format, before and after rewriting with, respectively, ground and nonground rewrite rules.\nThis is a synthetically created data set where the examples are pairs of equivalent polynomial terms. The first element of each pair is a polynomial in an arbitrary form and the second element is the same polynomial in a normalized form. The arbitrary polynomials are created randomly in a recursive manner from a set of available (non-nullary) function symbols, variables and constants. First, one of the symbols is randomly chosen. If it is a constant or a variable it is returned and the process terminates. If a function symbol is chosen, its subterm(s) are constructed recursively in a similar way.\nThe parameters of this process are set in such a way that it creates polynomial terms of average length around 25 symbols. Terms longer than 50 are filtered out. Several data sets of various difficulty were created by varying the number of available symbols. This were quite limited \u2013 at most 5 different variables and constants being a few first natural numbers. The reason for this limited complexity of the input terms is because normalizing even a relatively simple polynomial can result in a very long term with very large constants \u2013 which is related especially to the operation of exponentiation in polynomials.\nEach data set consists of different 300 000 examples, see Table TABREF7 for examples. These data sets were split into training, validation and test sets for our experiments ($60 \\%, 10 \\%, 30 \\%$, respectively).\nFor experiments with both data sets we used an established NMT architecture BIBREF10 based on LSTMs (long short-term memory cells) and implementing the attention mechanism.\nAfter a small grid search we decided to inherit most of the hyperparameters of the model from the best results achieved in BIBREF3 where -to-Mizar translation is learned. We used relatively small LSTM cells consisting of 2 layers with 128 units. The \u201cscaled Luong\u201d version of the attention mechanism was used, as well as dropout with rate equal $0.2$. The number of training steps was 10000. (This setting was used for all our experiments described below.)\nFirst, NMT models were trained for each of the 20 rewrite rules in the AIM data set. It turned out that the models, as long as the number of examples was greater than 1000, were able to learn the rewriting task very well, reaching $90\\%$ of accuracy on separated test sets. This means that the task of applying single rewrite step seems relatively easy to learn by NMT. See Table TABREF11 for all the results.\nWe also run an experiment on the joint set of all rewrite rules (consisting of 41396 examples). Here the task was more difficult as a model needed not only to apply rewriting correctly, but also choose \u201cthe right\u201d rewrite rule applicable for a given term. Nevertheless, the performance was also very good, reaching $83\\%$ of accuracy.\nThen experiments on more challenging but also much larger data sets for polynomial normalization were performed. Depending on the difficulty of the data, accuracy on the test sets achieved in our experiments varied between $70\\%$ and $99\\%$. The results in terms of accuracy are shown in Table TABREF13.\nThis high performance of the model encouraged a closer inspection of the results. First, we checked if in the test sets there are input examples which differs from these in training sets only by renaming of variables. Indeed, for each of the data sets in test sets are $5 - 15 \\%$ of such \u201crenamed\u201d examples. After filtering them out the measured accuracy drops \u2013 but only by $1 - 2 \\%$.\nAn examination of the examples wrongly rewritten by the model was done. It turns out that the wrong outputs almost always parse (in $97 - 99 \\%$ of cases they are legal polynomial terms). Notably, depending on the difficulty of the data set, as much as $18 - 64 \\%$ of incorrect outputs are wrong only with respect to the constants in the terms. (Typically, NMT model proposes too low constants compared to the correct ones.) Below $1 \\%$ of wrong outputs are correct modulo variable renaming.\nNMT is not typically applied to symbolic problems, but surprisingly, it performed very well for both described tasks. The first one was easier in terms of complexity of the rewriting (only one application of a rewrite rule was performed) but the number of examples was quite limited. The second task involved more difficult rewriting \u2013 multiple different rewrite steps were performed to construct the examples. Nevertheless, provided many examples, NMT could learn normalizing polynomials.\nWe hope this work provides a baseline and inspiration for continuing this line of research. We see several interesting directions this work can be extended.\nFirstly, more interesting and difficult rewriting problems need to be provided for better delineation of the strength of the neural models. The described data are relatively simple and with no direct relevance to the real unsolved symbolic problems. But the results on these simple problems are encouraging enough to try with more challenging ones, related to real difficulties \u2013 e.g. these from TPDB data base.\nSecondly, we are going to develop and test new kinds of neural models tailored for the problem of comprehending symbolic expressions. Specifically, we are going to implement an approach based on the idea of TreeNN, which may be another effective approach for this kind of tasks BIBREF7, BIBREF12, BIBREF13. TreeNNs are built recursively from modules, where the modules corresponds to parts of symbolic expression (symbols) and the shape of the network reflects the parse tree of the processed expression. This way model is explicitly informed on the exact structure of the expression, which in case of formal logic is always unambiguous and easy to extract. Perhaps this way the model could learn more efficiently from examples (and achieve higher results even on the small AIM data sets). The authors have a positive experience of applying TreeNNs to learn remainders of arithmetical expressions modulo small natural numbers \u2013 TreeNNs outperformed here neural models based on LSTM cells, giving almost perfect accuracy. However, this is unclear how to translate this TreeNN methodology to the tasks with the structured output, like the symbolic rewriting task.\nThirdly, there is an idea of integrating neural rewriting architectures into the larger systems for automated reasoning. This can be motivated by the interesting contrast between some simpler ILP systems suffering for combinatorial explosion in presence of a large number of examples and neural methods which definitely benefit form large data sets.\nWe hope that this work will inspire and trigger a discussion on the above (and other) ideas.\nPiotrowski was supported by the grant of National Science Center, Poland, no. 2018/29/N/ST6/02903, and by the European Agency COST action CA15123.

{"id": "1911.04873", "prompt": "Neural networks (NNs) turned out to be very useful in several domains. In particular, one of the most spectacular advances achieved with use of NNs has been natural language processing. One of the tasks in this domain is translation between natural languages \u2013 neural machine translation (NMT) systems established here the state-of-the-art performance. Recently, NMT produced first encouraging results in the autoformalization task BIBREF0, BIBREF1, BIBREF2, BIBREF3 where given an informal mathematical text in the goal is to translate it to its formal (computer understandable) counterpart. In particular, the NMT performance on a large synthetic -to-Mizar dataset produced by a relatively sophisticated toolchain developed for several decades BIBREF4 is surprisingly good BIBREF3, indicating that neural networks can learn quite complicated algorithms for symbolic data. This inspired us to pose a question: Can NMT models be used in the formal-to-formal setting? In particular: Can NMT models learn symbolic rewriting?\nThe answer is relevant to various tasks in automated reasoning. For example, neural models could compete with symbolic methods such as inductive logic programming BIBREF5 (ILP) that have been previously experimented with to learn simple rewrite tasks and theorem-proving heuristics from large formal corpora BIBREF6. Unlike (early) ILP, neural methods can however easily cope with large and rich datasets, without combinatorial explosion.\nOur work is also an inquiry into the capabilities of NNs as such, in the spirit of works like BIBREF7.\nTo perform experiments answering our question we prepared two data sets \u2013 the first consists of examples extracted from proofs found by ATP (automated theorem prover) in a mathematical domain (AIM loops), whereas the second is a synthetic set of polynomial terms.\nThe data consists of sets of ground and nonground rewrites that came from Prover9 proofs of theorems about AIM loops produced by Veroff BIBREF8.\nMany of the inferences in the proofs are paramodulations from an equation and have the form s = t\nu[(s)] = vu[(t)] = v where $s, t, u, v$ are terms and $\\theta $ is a substitution. For the most common equations $s = t$, we gathered corresponding pairs of terms $\\big (u[\\theta (s)], u[\\theta (t)]\\big )$ which were rewritten from one to another with $s = t$. We put the pairs to separate data sets (depending on the corresponding $s = t$): in total 8 data sets for ground rewrites (where $\\theta $ is trivial) and 12 for nonground ones. The goal will be to learn rewriting for each of this 20 rules separately.\nTerms in the examples are treated as linear sequences of tokens where tokens are single symbols (variable / costant / predicate names, brackets, commas). Numbers of examples in each of the data sets vary between 251 and 34101. Lengths of the sequences of tokens vary between 1 and 343, with mean around 35. These 20 data sets were split into training, validation and test sets for our experiments ($60 \\%, 10 \\%, 30 \\%$, respectively).\nIn Table TABREF4 and Table TABREF5 there are presented examples of pairs of AIM terms in TPTP BIBREF9 format, before and after rewriting with, respectively, ground and nonground rewrite rules.\nThis is a synthetically created data set where the examples are pairs of equivalent polynomial terms. The first element of each pair is a polynomial in an arbitrary form and the second element is the same polynomial in a normalized form. The arbitrary polynomials are created randomly in a recursive manner from a set of available (non-nullary) function symbols, variables and constants. First, one of the symbols is randomly chosen. If it is a constant or a variable it is returned and the process terminates. If a function symbol is chosen, its subterm(s) are constructed recursively in a similar way.\nThe parameters of this process are set in such a way that it creates polynomial terms of average length around 25 symbols. Terms longer than 50 are filtered out. Several data sets of various difficulty were created by varying the number of available symbols.

{"id": "1606.07043", "prompt": "A clinician can look at a patient's electronic health record (EHR) and not only decide whether the patient has diabetes but also produce a succinct summary of the clinical evidence. Replicating this feat with computational tools has been the focus of much research in clinical informatics. There are major initiatives underway to codify clinical knowledge into formal representations, most often as deterministic rules that can be applied in a semi-automated fashion BIBREF0 . However, representing the intuitive judgments of human experts can be challenging, particularly when the formal system does not match the expert's knowledge. For example, many deterministic disease classifiers used in clinical informatics rely heavily upon administrative codes not available at time of diagnosis. Further, developing and testing such systems is time- and labor-intensive.\nWe propose instead a lightweight information theoretic framework for codifying informal human knowledge and then use it to extract interpretable latent topics from text corpora. For example, to discover patients with diabetes in a set of clinical notes, a doctor can begin by specifying disease-specific anchor terms BIBREF1 , BIBREF2 , such as \u201cdiabetes\u201d or \u201cinsulin.\u201d Our framework then uses these to help discover both latent topics associated with diabetes and records in which diabetes-related topics occur. The user can then add (or remove) additional anchor terms (e.g., \u201cmetformin\u201d) to improve the quality of the learned (diabetes) topics.\nIn this workshop paper, we introduce a simple approach to anchored information theoretic topic modeling using a novel combination of Correlation Explanation (CorEx) BIBREF3 and the information bottleneck BIBREF4 . This flexible framework enables the user to leverage domain knowledge to guide exploration of a collection of documents and to impose semantics onto latent factors learned by CorEx. We present preliminary experimental results on two text corpora (including a corpus of clinical notes), showing that anchors can be used to discover topics that are more specific and relevant. What is more, we demonstrate the potential for this framework to perform weakly supervised learning in settings where labeling documents is prohibitively expensive BIBREF5 , BIBREF6 .\nWith respect to interpretable machine learning, our contributions are twofold. First, our framework provides a way for human users to share domain knowledge with a statistical learning algorithm that is both convenient for the human user and easily digestible by the machine. Second, our experimental results confirm that the introduction of simple anchor words can improve the coherence and human interpretability of topics discovered from data. Both are essential to successful and interactive collaboration between machine learning and human users.\nAnchored Correlation Explanation can be understood as a combination of Total Correlation Explanation (CorEx) BIBREF3 , BIBREF7 and the multivariate information bottleneck BIBREF4 , BIBREF8 . We search for a set of probabilistic functions of the inputs INLINEFORM0 for INLINEFORM1 that optimize the following information theoretic objective: INLINEFORM2 \nThe first term is the CorEx objective INLINEFORM0 , which aims to construct latent variables INLINEFORM1 that best explain multivariate dependencies in the data INLINEFORM2 . Here the data consist of INLINEFORM3 -dimensional binary vectors INLINEFORM4 . Total correlation, or multivariate mutual information BIBREF9 , is specified as INLINEFORM5 where INLINEFORM6 is the KL divergence. Maximizing INLINEFORM7 over latent factors INLINEFORM8 amounts to minimizing INLINEFORM9 , which measures how much dependence in INLINEFORM10 is explained by INLINEFORM11 . At the global optimum, INLINEFORM12 is zero and the observations are independent conditioned on the latent factors. Several papers have explored CorEx for unsupervised hierarchical topic modeling BIBREF3 , BIBREF10 , BIBREF11 .\nThe second term involves the mutual information between pairs of latent factors INLINEFORM0 ) and anchor variables INLINEFORM1 specified in the set INLINEFORM2 . This is inspired by the information bottleneck BIBREF4 , BIBREF8 , a supervised information-theoretic approach to discovering latent factors. The bottleneck objective INLINEFORM3 constructs latent factors INLINEFORM4 that trade off compression of INLINEFORM5 against preserving information about relevance variables INLINEFORM6 .\nAnchored CorEx preserves information about anchors while also explaining as much multivariate dependence between observations in INLINEFORM0 as possible. This framework is flexible: we can attach multiple anchors to one factor or one anchor to multiple factors. We have found empirically that INLINEFORM1 works well and does not need to be tuned.\nAnchors allow us to both seed CorEx and impose semantics on latent factors: when analyzing medical documents, for example, we can anchor a diabetes latent factor to the word \u201cdiabetes.\u201d The INLINEFORM0 objective then discovers other words associated with \u201cdiabetes\u201d and includes them in this topic.\nWhile there is not space here for a full description of the optimization, it is similar in principle to the approaches in BIBREF3 , BIBREF7 . Two points are worth noting: first, the TC objective is replaced by a lower bound to make optimization feasible BIBREF7 . Second, we impose a sparse connection constraint (each word appears in only one topic) to speed up computation. Open source code implementing CorEx is available on github BIBREF12 .\nThere is a large body of work on integrating domain knowledge into topic models and other unsupervised latent variable models, often in the form of constraints BIBREF13 , prior distributions BIBREF14 , and token labels BIBREF15 . Like Anchored CorEx, seeded latent dirichlet allocation (SeededLDA) allows the specification of word-topic relationships BIBREF16 . However, SeededLDA assumes a more complex latent structure, in which each topic is a mixture of two distributions, one unseeded and one seeded.\n BIBREF1 first proposed anchors in the context of topic modeling: words that are high precision indicators of underlying topics. In contrast to our approach, anchors are typically selected automatically, constrained to appear in only one topic, and used primarily to aid optimization BIBREF17 . In our information theoretic framework, anchors are specified manually and more loosely defined as words having high mutual information with one or more latent factors. The effects of anchors on the interpretability of traditional topic models are often mixed BIBREF18 , but our experiments suggest that our approach yields more coherent topics.\nIn health informatics, \u201canchor\u201d features chosen based on domain knowledge have been used to guide statistical learning BIBREF2 . In BIBREF6 , anchors are used as a source of distant supervision BIBREF19 , BIBREF20 for classifiers in the absence of ground truth labels. While Anchored CorEx can be used for discriminative tasks, it is essentially unsupervised. Recent work by BIBREF21 is perhaps most similar in spirit to ours: they exploit predefined anchors to help learn and impose semantics on a discrete latent factor model with a directed acyclic graph structure. We utilize an information theoretic approach that makes no generative modeling assumptions.\nTo demonstrate the utility of Anchored CorEx, we run experiments on two document collections: 20 Newsgroups and the i2b2 2008 Obesity Challenge BIBREF22 data set. Both corpora provide ground truth labels for latent classes that may be thought of as topics.\nThe 20 Newsgroups data set is suitable for a straightforward evaluation of anchored topic models. The latent classes represent mutually exclusive categories, and each document is known to originate from a single category. We find that the correlation structure among the latent classes is less complex than in the Obesity Challenge data. Further, each category tends to exhibit some specialized vocabulary not used extensively in other categories (thus satisfying the anchor assumption from BIBREF1 ).\nTo prepare the data, we removed headers, footers, and quotes and reduced the vocabulary to the most frequent 20,000 words. Each document was represented as a binary bag-of-words vector. In all experiemnts, we used the standard training/test split. All CorEx models used three layers of 40, 3, and 1 factors. fig:big shows an example hierarchical topic model extracted by Anchored CorEx.\nThe Obesity Challenge 2008 data set includes 1237 deidentified clinical discharge summaries from the Partners HealthCare Research Patient Data Repository. All summaries have been labeled by clinical experts with obesity and 15 other conditions commonly comorbid with obesity, ranging from Coronary Artery Disease (663 positives) to Depression (247) to Hypertriglyceridemia (62).\nWe preprocessed each document with a standard biomedical text pipeline that extracts common medical terms and phrases (grouping neighboring words where appropriate) and detecting negation (\u201cnot\u201d is prepended to negated terms) BIBREF23 , BIBREF24 . We converted each document to a binary bag-of-words with a vocabulary of 4114 (possibly negated) medical phrases. We used the 60/40 training/test split from the competition.\nWe are primarily interested in the ability of Anchored CorEx to extract latent topics that are unambiguously associated with the 16 known conditions. We train a series of CorEx models with 32 latent topics in the first layer, each using a different anchor strategy. tab:obesity:topics shows the Obesity and Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) topics for three iterations of Anchored CorEx with the ten most important terms (highest weighted connections to the latent factor) listed for each topic. Unsupervised CorEx (first row) does not discover any topics obviously related to obesity or OSA, so we choose the topics to which the terms obesity and obstructive sleep apnea are assigned. No unambiguous Obesity or OSA topics emerge even as the number of latent factors is decreased or increased.\nIn the second iteration (second row), we add the common name of each of the 16 diseases as an anchor to one factor (16 total). Adding obesity as an anchor produces a clear Obesity topic, including several medications known to cause weight gain (e.g., acebutolol, klonopin). The anchored OSA topic, however, is quite poor and in fact resembles the rather generic topic to which obstructive sleep apnea is assigned by Unsupervised CorEx. It includes many spurious or non-specific terms like drug.\nThis is likely due to the fact that obesity is a major risk factor of OSA, and so OSA symptoms are highly correlated with obesity and its other symptoms. Thus, the total correlation objective will attempt to group obesity and OSA-related terms together under a single latent factor. The sparse connection constraint mentioned in sec:methods prevents them from being connected to multiple factors. Indeed, sleep apnea appears in the obesity topic, suggesting the two topics are competing to explain OSA terms.\nIn the third iteration, we correct this by adding sleep apnea as a second anchor to the OSA topic, and the resulting topic is clearly associated with OSA, including terms related to respiratory problems and medications used to treat (or believed to increase risk for) OSA. There is no noticeable reduction in quality in the Obesity topic.\nIn a series of follow-up experiments, we investigate the suitability of using anchored CorEx to perform weakly supervised classification. We interpret each anchored latent factor as a classifier for an associated class label and then compute test set F1 (using a threshold of 0.5) and area under the curve (AUC) scores (Obesity Challenge only).\ntab:class compares the classification performance of Unsupervised and Anchored CorEx on the soc.religion.christianity category from 20 Newsgroups for different choices of anchors. For both types of CorEx, the topic containing the corresponding terms is used as the classifier, but for Anchored CorEx those terms are also used as anchors when estimating the latent factor. Unsupervised CorEx does a reasonable job of discovering a coherent religion topic that already contains the terms God, Christian, and Jesus. However, using the terms Jesus and Christian as anchors yields a topic that better predicts the actual soc.religion.christianity category.\ntab:obesity:class shows the Macro-AUC and F1 scores (averaged across all diseases) on the Obesity Challenge data for the final anchored CorEx model and a Naive Bayes (NB) baseline, in which we train a separate classifier for each disease. Surprisingly, Anchored CorEx outperforms Naive Bayes (NB) by a large margin. Of course, Anchored CorEx is not a replacement for supervised learning: NB beats Anchored CorEx on 20 Newsgroups and does not represent a \u201cstrong\u201d baseline for Obesity 2008 (teams scored above 0.7 in Macro-F1 during the competition). It is nonetheless remarkable that Anchored CorEx performs as well as it does given that it is fundamentally unsupervised.\nWe have introduced a simple information theoretic approach to topic modeling that can leverage domain knowledge specified informally as anchors. Our framework uses a novel combination of CorEx and the information bottleneck. Preliminary results suggest it can extract more precise, interpretable topics through a lightweight interactive process. We next plan to perform further empirical evaluations and to extend the algorithm to handle complex latent structures present in health care data.\nThis work was partially supported by DARPA award HR0011-15-C-0115.

First, our framework provides a way for human users to share domain knowledge with a statistical learning algorithm that is both convenient for the human user and easily digestible by the machine. Second, our experimental results confirm that the introduction of simple anchor words can improve the coherence and human interpretability of topics discovered from data. Both are essential to successful and interactive collaboration between machine learning and human users.\nAnchored Correlation Explanation can be understood as a combination of Total Correlation Explanation (CorEx) BIBREF3 , BIBREF7 and the multivariate information bottleneck BIBREF4 , BIBREF8 . We search for a set of probabilistic functions of the inputs INLINEFORM0 for INLINEFORM1 that optimize the following information theoretic objective: INLINEFORM2 \nThe first term is the CorEx objective INLINEFORM0 , which aims to construct latent variables INLINEFORM1 that best explain multivariate dependencies in the data INLINEFORM2 . Here the data consist of INLINEFORM3 -dimensional binary vectors INLINEFORM4 . Total correlation, or multivariate mutual information BIBREF9 , is specified as INLINEFORM5 where INLINEFORM6 is the KL divergence. Maximizing INLINEFORM7 over latent factors INLINEFORM8 amounts to minimizing INLINEFORM9 , which measures how much dependence in INLINEFORM10 is explained by INLINEFORM11 . At the global optimum, INLINEFORM12 is zero and the observations are independent conditioned on the latent factors. Several papers have explored CorEx for unsupervised hierarchical topic modeling BIBREF3 , BIBREF10 , BIBREF11 .\nThe second term involves the mutual information between pairs of latent factors INLINEFORM0 ) and anchor variables INLINEFORM1 specified in the set INLINEFORM2 . This is inspired by the information bottleneck BIBREF4 , BIBREF8 , a supervised information-theoretic approach to discovering latent factors. The bottleneck objective INLINEFORM3 constructs latent factors INLINEFORM4 that trade off compression of INLINEFORM5 against preserving information about relevance variables INLINEFORM6 .\nAnchored CorEx preserves information about anchors while also explaining as much multivariate dependence between observations in INLINEFORM0 as possible. This framework is flexible: we can attach multiple anchors to one factor or one anchor to multiple factors. We have found empirically that INLINEFORM1 works well and does not need to be tuned.\nAnchors allow us to both seed CorEx and impose semantics on latent factors: when analyzing medical documents, for example, we can anchor a diabetes latent factor to the word \u201cdiabetes.\u201d The INLINEFORM0 objective then discovers other words associated with \u201cdiabetes\u201d and includes them in this topic.\nWhile there is not space here for a full description of the optimization, it is similar in principle to the approaches in BIBREF3 , BIBREF7 . Two points are worth noting: first, the TC objective is replaced by a lower bound to make optimization feasible BIBREF7 . Second, we impose a sparse connection constraint (each word appears in only one topic) to speed up computation. Open source code implementing CorEx is available on github BIBREF12 .\nThere is a large body of work on integrating domain knowledge into topic models and other unsupervised latent variable models, often in the form of constraints BIBREF13 , prior distributions BIBREF14 , and token labels BIBREF15 . Like Anchored CorEx, seeded latent dirichlet allocation (SeededLDA) allows the specification of word-topic relationships BIBREF16 . However, SeededLDA assumes a more complex latent structure, in which each topic is a mixture of two distributions, one unseeded and one seeded.\n BIBREF1 first proposed anchors in the context of topic modeling: words that are high precision indicators of underlying topics. In contrast to our approach, anchors are typically selected automatically, constrained to appear in only one topic, and used primarily to aid optimization BIBREF17 . In our information theoretic framework, anchors are specified manually and more loosely defined as words having high mutual information with one or more latent factors. The effects of anchors on the interpretability of traditional topic models are often mixed BIBREF18 , but our experiments suggest that our approach yields more coherent topics.\nIn health informatics, \u201canchor\u201d features chosen based on domain knowledge have been used to guide statistical learning BIBREF2 . In BIBREF6 , anchors are used as a source of distant supervision BIBREF19 , BIBREF20 for classifiers in the absence of ground truth labels. While Anchored CorEx can be used for discriminative tasks, it is essentially unsupervised. Recent work by BIBREF21 is perhaps most similar in spirit to ours: they exploit predefined anchors to help learn and impose semantics on a discrete latent factor model with a directed acyclic graph structure. We utilize an information theoretic approach that makes no generative modeling assumptions.\nTo demonstrate the utility of Anchored CorEx, we run experiments on two document collections: 20 Newsgroups and the i2b2 2008 Obesity Challenge BIBREF22 data set. Both corpora provide ground truth labels for latent classes that may be thought of as topics.\nThe 20 Newsgroups data set is suitable for a straightforward evaluation of anchored topic models. The latent classes represent mutually exclusive categories, and each document is known to originate from a single category. We find that the correlation structure among the latent classes is less complex than in the Obesity Challenge data. Further, each category tends to exhibit some specialized vocabulary not used extensively in other categories (thus satisfying the anchor assumption from BIBREF1 ).\nTo prepare the data, we removed headers, footers, and quotes and reduced the vocabulary to the most frequent 20,000 words. Each document was represented as a binary bag-of-words vector. In all experiemnts, we used the standard training/test split. All CorEx models used three layers of 40, 3, and 1 factors. fig:big shows an example hierarchical topic model extracted by Anchored CorEx.\nThe Obesity Challenge 2008 data set includes 1237 deidentified clinical discharge summaries from the Partners HealthCare Research Patient Data Repository. All summaries have been labeled by clinical experts with obesity and 15 other conditions commonly comorbid with obesity, ranging from Coronary Artery Disease (663 positives) to Depression (247) to Hypertriglyceridemia (62).\nWe preprocessed each document with a standard biomedical text pipeline that extracts common medical terms and phrases (grouping neighboring words where appropriate) and detecting negation (\u201cnot\u201d is prepended to negated terms) BIBREF23 , BIBREF24 . We converted each document to a binary bag-of-words with a vocabulary of 4114 (possibly negated) medical phrases. We used the 60/40 training/test split from the competition.\nWe are primarily interested in the ability of Anchored CorEx to extract latent topics that are unambiguously associated with the 16 known conditions. We train a series of CorEx models with 32 latent topics in the first layer, each using a different anchor strategy. tab:obesity:topics shows the Obesity and Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) topics for three iterations of Anchored CorEx with the ten most important terms (highest weighted connections to the latent factor) listed for each topic. Unsupervised CorEx (first row) does not discover any topics obviously related to obesity or OSA, so we choose the topics to which the terms obesity and obstructive sleep apnea are assigned. No unambiguous Obesity or OSA topics emerge even as the number of latent factors is decreased or increased.\nIn the second iteration (second row), we add the common name of each of the 16 diseases as an anchor to one factor (16 total). Adding obesity as an anchor produces a clear Obesity topic, including several medications known to cause weight gain (e.g., acebutolol, klonopin). The anchored OSA topic, however, is quite poor and in fact resembles the rather generic topic to which obstructive sleep apnea is assigned by Unsupervised CorEx. It includes many spurious or non-specific terms like drug.\nThis is likely due to the fact that obesity is a major risk factor of OSA, and so OSA symptoms are highly correlated with obesity and its other symptoms. Thus, the total correlation objective will attempt to group obesity and OSA-related terms together under a single latent factor. The sparse connection constraint mentioned in sec:methods prevents them from being connected to multiple factors. Indeed, sleep apnea appears in the obesity topic, suggesting the two topics are competing to explain OSA terms.\nIn the third iteration, we correct this by adding sleep apnea as a second anchor to the OSA topic, and the resulting topic is clearly associated with OSA, including terms related to respiratory problems and medications used to treat (or believed to increase risk for) OSA. There is no noticeable reduction in quality in the Obesity topic.\nIn a series of follow-up experiments, we investigate the suitability of using anchored CorEx to perform weakly supervised classification. We interpret each anchored latent factor as a classifier for an associated class label and then compute test set F1 (using a threshold of 0.5) and area under the curve (AUC) scores (Obesity Challenge only).\ntab:class compares the classification performance of Unsupervised and Anchored CorEx on the soc.religion.christianity category from 20 Newsgroups for different choices of anchors. For both types of CorEx, the topic containing the corresponding terms is used as the classifier, but for Anchored CorEx those terms are also used as anchors when estimating the latent factor. Unsupervised CorEx does a reasonable job of discovering a coherent religion topic that already contains the terms God, Christian, and Jesus. However, using the terms Jesus and Christian as anchors yields a topic that better predicts the actual soc.religion.christianity category.\ntab:obesity:class shows the Macro-AUC and F1 scores (averaged across all diseases) on the Obesity Challenge data for the final anchored CorEx model and a Naive Bayes (NB) baseline, in which we train a separate classifier for each disease. Surprisingly, Anchored CorEx outperforms Naive Bayes (NB) by a large margin. Of course, Anchored CorEx is not a replacement for supervised learning: NB beats Anchored CorEx on 20 Newsgroups and does not represent a \u201cstrong\u201d baseline for Obesity 2008 (teams scored above 0.7 in Macro-F1 during the competition). It is nonetheless remarkable that Anchored CorEx performs as well as it does given that it is fundamentally unsupervised.\nWe have introduced a simple information theoretic approach to topic modeling that can leverage domain knowledge specified informally as anchors. Our framework uses a novel combination of CorEx and the information bottleneck. Preliminary results suggest it can extract more precise, interpretable topics through a lightweight interactive process. We next plan to perform further empirical evaluations and to extend the algorithm to handle complex latent structures present in health care data.\nThis work was partially supported by DARPA award HR0011-15-C-0115.

The natural language processing tasks on social media are more challenging which draw attention of many researchers BIBREF0 , BIBREF1 , BIBREF2 , BIBREF3 . As the foundation of many downstream applications BIBREF4 , BIBREF5 , BIBREF6 such as information extraction, named entity recognition (NER) deserves more research in prevailing and challenging social media text. NER is a task to identify names in texts and to assign names with particular types BIBREF7 , BIBREF8 , BIBREF9 , BIBREF10 . It is the informality of social media that discourages accuracy of NER systems. While efforts in English have narrowed the gap between social media and formal domains BIBREF3 , the task in Chinese remains challenging. It is caused by Chinese logographic characters which lack many clues to indicate whether a word is a name, such as capitalization. The scant labelled Chinese social media corpus makes the task more challenging BIBREF11 , BIBREF12 , BIBREF13 .\nTo address the problem, one approach is to use the lexical embeddings learnt from massive unlabeled text. To take better advantage of unlabeled text, Peng and Dredze peng-dredze:2015:EMNLP evaluates three types of embeddings for Chinese text, and shows the effectiveness of positional character embeddings with experiments. Considering the value of word segmentation in Chinese NER, another approach is to construct an integrated model to jointly train learned representations for both predicting word segmentations and NER BIBREF14 .\nHowever, the two above approaches are implemented within CRF model. We construct a semi-supervised model based on B-LSTM neural network to learn from the limited labelled corpus by using lexical information provided by massive unlabeled text. To shrink the gap between label accuracy and F-Score, we propose a method to directly train on F-Score rather than label accuracy in our model. In addition, we propose an integrated method to train on both F-Score and label accuracy. Specifically, we make contributions as follows:\nWe construct a semi-supervised model which is based on B-LSTM neural network and combine transition probability to form structured output. We propose a method to train directly on F-Score in our model. In addition, we propose an integrated method to train on both F-Score and label accuracy.\nB-LSTM neural network can learn from past input features and LSTM layer makes it more efficient BIBREF15 , BIBREF16 , BIBREF17 , BIBREF18 . However, B-LSTM cannot learn sentence level label information. Huang et al. huang2015bidirectional combine CRF to use sentence level label information. We combine transition probability into our model to gain sentence level label information. To combine transition probability into B-LSTM neural network, we construct a Max Margin Neural Network (MMNN) BIBREF19 based on B-LSTM. The prediction of label in position INLINEFORM0 is given as: DISPLAYFORM0 \nwhere INLINEFORM0 are the transformation parameters, INLINEFORM1 the hidden vector and INLINEFORM2 the bias parameter. For a input sentence INLINEFORM3 with a label sequence INLINEFORM4 , a sentence-level score is then given as: DISPLAYFORM0 \nwhere INLINEFORM0 indicates the probability of label INLINEFORM1 at position INLINEFORM2 by the network with parameters INLINEFORM3 , INLINEFORM4 indicates the matrix of transition probability. In our model, INLINEFORM5 is computed as: DISPLAYFORM0 \nWe define a structured margin loss INLINEFORM0 as Pei et al. pei-ge-chang:2014:P14-1: DISPLAYFORM0 \nwhere INLINEFORM0 is the length of setence INLINEFORM1 , INLINEFORM2 is a discount parameter, INLINEFORM3 a given correct label sequence and INLINEFORM4 a predicted label sequence. For a given training instance INLINEFORM5 , our predicted label sequence is the label sequence with highest score: INLINEFORM6 \nThe label sequence with the highest score can be obtained by carrying out viterbi algorithm. The regularized objective function is as follows: DISPLAYFORM0 INLINEFORM0 \nBy minimizing the object, we can increase the score of correct label sequence INLINEFORM0 and decrease the score of incorrect label sequence INLINEFORM1 .\nMax Margin training method use structured margin loss INLINEFORM0 to describe the difference between the corrected label sequence INLINEFORM1 and predicted label sequence INLINEFORM2 . In fact, the structured margin loss INLINEFORM3 reflect the loss in label accuracy. Considering the gap between label accuracy and F-Score in NER, we introduce a new training method to train directly on F-Score. To introduce F-Score driven training method, we need to take a look at the subgradient of equation ( EQREF9 ): INLINEFORM4 \nIn the subgradient, we can know that structured margin loss INLINEFORM0 contributes nothing to the subgradient of the regularized objective function INLINEFORM1 . The margin loss INLINEFORM2 serves as a trigger function to conduct the training process of B-LSTM based MMNN. We can introduce a new trigger function to guide the training process of neural network.\nF-Score Trigger Function The main criterion of NER task is F-score. However, high label accuracy does not mean high F-score. For instance, if every named entity's last character is labeledas O, the label accuracy can be quite high, but the precision, recall and F-score are 0. We use the F-Score between corrected label sequence and predicted label sequence as trigger function, which can conduct the training process to optimize the F-Score of training examples. Our new structured margin loss can be described as: DISPLAYFORM0 \nwhere INLINEFORM0 is the F-Score between corrected label sequence and predicted label sequence.\nF-Score and Label Accuracy Trigger Function The F-Score can be quite unstable in some situation. For instance, if there is no named entity in a sentence, F-Score will be always 0 regardless of the predicted label sequence. To take advantage of meaningful information provided by label accuracy, we introduce an integrated trigger function as follows: DISPLAYFORM0 \nwhere INLINEFORM0 is a factor to adjust the weight of label accuracy and F-Score.\nBecause F-Score depends on the whole label sequence, we use beam search to find INLINEFORM0 label sequences with top sentece-level score INLINEFORM1 and then use trigger function to rerank the INLINEFORM2 label sequences and select the best.\nWord segmentation takes an important part in Chinese text processing. Both Peng and Dredze peng-dredze:2015:EMNLP and Peng and Dredze peng-dredze:2016:P16-2 show the value of word segmentation to Chinese NER in social media. We present two methods to use word segmentation information in neural network model.\nCharacter and Position Embeddings To incorporate word segmentation information, we attach every character with its positional tag. This method is to distinguish the same character at different position in the word. We need to word segment the text and learn positional character embeddings from the segmented text.\nCharacter Embeddings and Word Segmentation Features We can treat word segmentation as discrete features in neural network model. The discrete features can be easily incorporated into neural network model BIBREF20 . We use word embeddings from a LSTM pretrained on MSRA 2006 corpus to initialize the word segmentation features.\nWe use a modified labelled corpus as Peng and Dredze peng-dredze:2016:P16-2 for NER in Chinese social media. Details of the data are listed in Table TABREF19 . We also use the same unlabelled text as Peng and Dredze peng-dredze:2016:P16-2 from Sina Weibo service in China and the text is word segmented by a Chinese word segmentation system Jieba as Peng and Dredze peng-dredze:2016:P16-2 so that our results are more comparable to theirs.\nWe pre-trained embeddings using word2vec BIBREF22 with the skip-gram training model, without negative sampling and other default parameter settings. Like Mao et al. mao2008chinese, we use bigram features as follow: INLINEFORM0 \nWe use window approach BIBREF20 to extract higher level Features from word feature vectors. We treat bigram features as discrete features BIBREF20 for our neural network. Our models are trained using stochastic gradient descent with an L2 regularizer.\nAs for parameters in our models, window size for word embedding is 5, word embedding dimension, feature embedding dimension and hidden vector dimension are all 100, discount INLINEFORM0 in margin loss is INLINEFORM1 , and the hyper parameter for the INLINEFORM2 is INLINEFORM3 . As for learning rate, initial learning rate is INLINEFORM4 with a decay rate INLINEFORM5 . For integrated model, INLINEFORM6 is INLINEFORM7 . We train 20 epochs and choose the best prediction for test.\nWe evaluate two methods to incorporate word segmentation information. The results of two methods are shown as Table TABREF22 . We can see that positional character embeddings perform better in neural network. This is probably because positional character embeddings method can learn word segmentation information from unlabeled text while word segmentation can only use training corpus.\nWe adopt positional character embeddings in our next four models. Our first model is a B-LSTM neural network (baseline). To take advantage of traditional model BIBREF23 , BIBREF24 such as CRF, we combine transition probability in our B-LSTM based MMNN. We design a F-Score driven training method in our third model F-Score Driven Model I . We propose an integrated training method in our fourth model F-Score Driven Model II .The results of models are depicted as Figure UID11 . From the figure, we can know our models perfrom better with little loss in time.\nTable TABREF23 shows results for NER on test sets. In the Table TABREF23 , we also show micro F1-score (Overall) and out-of-vocabulary entities (OOV) recall. Peng and Dredze peng-dredze:2016:P16-2 is the state-of-the-art NER system in Chinese Social media. By comparing the results of B-LSTM model and B-LSTM + MTNN model, we can know transition probability is significant for NER. Compared with B-LSTM + MMNN model, F-Score Driven Model I improves the result of named entity with a loss in nominal mention. The integrated training model (F-Score Driven Model II) benefits from both label accuracy and F-Score, which achieves a new state-of-the-art NER system in Chinese social media. Our integrated model has better performance on named entity and nominal mention.\nTo better understand the impact of the factor INLINEFORM0 , we show the results of our integrated model with different values of INLINEFORM1 in Figure UID13 . From Figure UID13 , we can know that INLINEFORM2 is an important factor for us to balance F-score and accuracy. Our integrated model may help alleviate the influence of noise in NER in Chinese social media.\nThe results of our experiments also suggest directions for future work. We can observe all models in Table TABREF23 achieve a much lower recall than precision BIBREF25 . So we need to design some methods to solve the problem.\nThanks to Shuming Ma for the help on improving the writing.

{"id": "1611.04234", "prompt": "With the development of Internet, social media plays an important role in information exchange. The natural language processing tasks on social media are more challenging which draw attention of many researchers BIBREF0 , BIBREF1 , BIBREF2 , BIBREF3 . As the foundation of many downstream applications BIBREF4 , BIBREF5 , BIBREF6 such as information extraction, named entity recognition (NER) deserves more research in prevailing and challenging social media text. NER is a task to identify names in texts and to assign names with particular types BIBREF7 , BIBREF8 , BIBREF9 , BIBREF10 . It is the informality of social media that discourages accuracy of NER systems. While efforts in English have narrowed the gap between social media and formal domains BIBREF3 , the task in Chinese remains challenging. It is caused by Chinese logographic characters which lack many clues to indicate whether a word is a name, such as capitalization. The scant labelled Chinese social media corpus makes the task more challenging BIBREF11 , BIBREF12 , BIBREF13 .\nTo address the problem, one approach is to use the lexical embeddings learnt from massive unlabeled text. To take better advantage of unlabeled text, Peng and Dredze peng-dredze:2015:EMNLP evaluates three types of embeddings for Chinese text, and shows the effectiveness of positional character embeddings with experiments. Considering the value of word segmentation in Chinese NER, another approach is to construct an integrated model to jointly train learned representations for both predicting word segmentations and NER BIBREF14 .\nHowever, the two above approaches are implemented within CRF model. We construct a semi-supervised model based on B-LSTM neural network to learn from the limited labelled corpus by using lexical information provided by massive unlabeled text. To shrink the gap between label accuracy and F-Score, we propose a method to directly train on F-Score rather than label accuracy in our model. In addition, we propose an integrated method to train on both F-Score and label accuracy. Specifically, we make contributions as follows:\nWe construct a semi-supervised model which is based on B-LSTM neural network and combine transition probability to form structured output. We propose a method to train directly on F-Score in our model. In addition, we propose an integrated method to train on both F-Score and label accuracy.\nB-LSTM neural network can learn from past input features and LSTM layer makes it more efficient BIBREF15 , BIBREF16 , BIBREF17 , BIBREF18 . However, B-LSTM cannot learn sentence level label information. Huang et al. huang2015bidirectional combine CRF to use sentence level label information. We combine transition probability into our model to gain sentence level label information. To combine transition probability into B-LSTM neural network, we construct a Max Margin Neural Network (MMNN) BIBREF19 based on B-LSTM. The prediction of label in position INLINEFORM0 is given as: DISPLAYFORM0 \nwhere INLINEFORM0 are the transformation parameters, INLINEFORM1 the hidden vector and INLINEFORM2 the bias parameter. For a input sentence INLINEFORM3 with a label sequence INLINEFORM4 , a sentence-level score is then given as: DISPLAYFORM0 \nwhere INLINEFORM0 indicates the probability of label INLINEFORM1 at position INLINEFORM2 by the network with parameters INLINEFORM3 , INLINEFORM4 indicates the matrix of transition probability. In our model, INLINEFORM5 is computed as: DISPLAYFORM0 \nWe define a structured margin loss INLINEFORM0 as Pei et al. pei-ge-chang:2014:P14-1: DISPLAYFORM0 \nwhere INLINEFORM0 is the length of setence INLINEFORM1 , INLINEFORM2 is a discount parameter, INLINEFORM3 a given correct label sequence and INLINEFORM4 a predicted label sequence. For a given training instance INLINEFORM5 , our predicted label sequence is the label sequence with highest score: INLINEFORM6 \nThe label sequence with the highest score can be obtained by carrying out viterbi algorithm. The regularized objective function is as follows: DISPLAYFORM0 INLINEFORM0 \nBy minimizing the object, we can increase the score of correct label sequence INLINEFORM0 and decrease the score of incorrect label sequence INLINEFORM1 .\nMax Margin training method use structured margin loss INLINEFORM0 to describe the difference between the corrected label sequence INLINEFORM1 and predicted label sequence INLINEFORM2 . In fact, the structured margin loss INLINEFORM3 reflect the loss in label accuracy. Considering the gap between label accuracy and F-Score in NER, we introduce a new training method to train directly on F-Score. To introduce F-Score driven training method, we need to take a look at the subgradient of equation ( EQREF9 ): INLINEFORM4 \nIn the subgradient, we can know that structured margin loss INLINEFORM0 contributes nothing to the subgradient of the regularized objective function INLINEFORM1 . The margin loss INLINEFORM2 serves as a trigger function to conduct the training process of B-LSTM based MMNN. We can introduce a new trigger function to guide the training process of neural network.\nF-Score Trigger Function The main criterion of NER task is F-score. However, high label accuracy does not mean high F-score. For instance, if every named entity's last character is labeledas O, the label accuracy can be quite high, but the precision, recall and F-score are 0. We use the F-Score between corrected label sequence and predicted label sequence as trigger function, which can conduct the training process to optimize the F-Score of training examples. Our new structured margin loss can be described as: DISPLAYFORM0 \nwhere INLINEFORM0 is the F-Score between corrected label sequence and predicted label sequence.\nF-Score and Label Accuracy Trigger Function The F-Score can be quite unstable in some situation. For instance, if there is no named entity in a sentence, F-Score will be always 0 regardless of the predicted label sequence. To take advantage of meaningful information provided by label accuracy, we introduce an integrated trigger function as follows: DISPLAYFORM0 \nwhere INLINEFORM0 is a factor to adjust the weight of label accuracy and F-Score.\nBecause F-Score depends on the whole label sequence, we use beam search to find INLINEFORM0 label sequences with top sentece-level score INLINEFORM1 and then use trigger function to rerank the INLINEFORM2 label sequences and select the best.\nWord segmentation takes an important part in Chinese text processing. Both Peng and Dredze peng-dredze:2015:EMNLP and Peng and Dredze peng-dredze:2016:P16-2 show the value of word segmentation to Chinese NER in social media. We present two methods to use word segmentation information in neural network model.\nCharacter and Position Embeddings To incorporate word segmentation information, we attach every character with its positional tag. This method is to distinguish the same character at different position in the word. We need to word segment the text and learn positional character embeddings from the segmented text.\nCharacter Embeddings and Word Segmentation Features We can treat word segmentation as discrete features in neural network model. The discrete features can be easily incorporated into neural network model BIBREF20 . We use word embeddings from a LSTM pretrained on MSRA 2006 corpus to initialize the word segmentation features.\nWe use a modified labelled corpus as Peng and Dredze peng-dredze:2016:P16-2 for NER in Chinese social media. Details of the data are listed in Table TABREF19 . We also use the same unlabelled text as Peng and Dredze peng-dredze:2016:P16-2 from Sina Weibo service in China and the text is word segmented by a Chinese word segmentation system Jieba as Peng and Dredze peng-dredze:2016:P16-2 so that our results are more comparable to theirs.\nWe pre-trained embeddings using word2vec BIBREF22 with the skip-gram training model, without negative sampling and other default parameter settings. Like Mao et al. mao2008chinese, we use bigram features as follow: INLINEFORM0 \nWe use window approach BIBREF20 to extract higher level Features from word feature vectors. We treat bigram features as discrete features BIBREF20 for our neural network. Our models are trained using stochastic gradient descent with an L2 regularizer.\nAs for parameters in our models, window size for word embedding is 5, word embedding dimension, feature embedding dimension and hidden vector dimension are all 100, discount INLINEFORM0 in margin loss is INLINEFORM1 , and the hyper parameter for the INLINEFORM2 is INLINEFORM3 . As for learning rate, initial learning rate is INLINEFORM4 with a decay rate INLINEFORM5 . For integrated model, INLINEFORM6 is INLINEFORM7 . We train 20 epochs and choose the best prediction for test.\nWe evaluate two methods to incorporate word segmentation information. The results of two methods are shown as Table TABREF22 . We can see that positional character embeddings perform better in neural network. This is probably because positional character embeddings method can learn word segmentation information from unlabeled text while word segmentation can only use training corpus.\nWe adopt positional character embeddings in our next four models. Our first model is a B-LSTM neural network (baseline). To take advantage of traditional model BIBREF23 , BIBREF24 such as CRF, we combine transition probability in our B-LSTM based MMNN. We design a F-Score driven training method in our third model F-Score Driven Model I . We propose an integrated training method in our fourth model F-Score Driven Model II .The results of models are depicted as Figure UID11 .

{"id": "1909.00437", "prompt": "English has an abundance of labeled data that can be used for various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, such as part-of-speech tagging (POS), named entity recognition (NER), and natural language inference (NLI). This richness of labeled data manifests itself as a boost in accuracy in the current era of data-hungry deep learning algorithms. However, the same is not true for many other languages where task specific data is scarce and expensive to acquire. This motivates the need for cross-lingual transfer learning \u2013 the ability to leverage the knowledge from task specific data available in one or more languages to solve that task in languages with little or no task-specific data.\nRecent progress in NMT has enabled one to train multilingual systems that support translation from multiple source languages into multiple target languages within a single model BIBREF2, BIBREF3, BIBREF0. Such multilingual NMT (mNMT) systems often demonstrate large improvements in translation quality on low resource languages. This positive transfer originates from the model's ability to learn representations which are transferable across languages. Previous work has shown that these representations can then be used for cross-lingual transfer in other downstream NLP tasks - albeit on only a pair of language pairs BIBREF4, or by limiting the decoder to use a pooled vector representation of the entire sentence from the encoder BIBREF5.\nIn this paper we scale up the number of translation directions used in the NMT model to include 102 languages to and from English. Unlike BIBREF5, we do not apply any restricting operations such as pooling while training mNMT which allows us to obtain token level representations making it possible to transfer them to sequence tagging tasks as well. We find that mNMT models trained using plain translation losses can out of the box emerge as competitive alternatives to other methods at the forefront of cross-lingual transfer learning BIBREF1, BIBREF5\nOur contributions in this paper are threefold:\nWe use representations from a Massively Multilingual Translation Encoder (MMTE) that can handle 103 languages to achieve cross-lingual transfer on 5 classification and sequence tagging tasks spanning more than 50 languages.\nWe compare MMTE to mBERT in different cross-lingual transfer scenarios including zero-shot, few-shot, fine-tuning, and feature extraction scenarios.\nWe outperform the state-of-the-art on zero-shot cross-lingual POS tagging [Universal Dependencies 2.3 dataset BIBREF6], intent classification BIBREF7, and achieve results comparable to state-of-the-art on document classification [ML-Doc dataset BIBREF8].\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section SECREF2 describes our MMTE model in detail and points out its differences from mBERT. All experimental details, results and analysis are given in Sections SECREF3 and SECREF4. This is followed by a discussion of related work. In Section SECREF6, we summarize our findings and present directions for future research. We emphasize that the primary motivation of the paper is not to challenge the state-of-the-art but instead to investigate the effectiveness of representations learned from an mNMT model in various transfer-learning settings.\nIn this section, we describe our massively multilingual NMT system. Similar to BERT, our transfer learning setup has two distinct steps: pre-training and fine-tuning. During pre-training, the NMT model is trained on large amounts of parallel data to perform translation. During fine-tuning, we initialize our downstream model with the pre-trained parameters from the encoder of the NMT system, and then all of the parameters are fine-tuned using labeled data from the downstream tasks.\nWe train our Massively Multilingual NMT system using the Transformer architecture BIBREF9 in the open-source implementation under the Lingvo framework BIBREF10. We use a larger version of Transformer Big containing 375M parameters (6 layers, 16 heads, 8192 hidden dimension) BIBREF11, and a shared source-target sentence-piece model (SPM) BIBREF12 vocabulary with 64k individual tokens. All our models are trained with Adafactor BIBREF13 with momentum factorization, a learning rate schedule of (3.0, 40k) and a per-parameter norm clipping threshold of 1.0. The encoder of this NMT model comprises approximately 190M parameters and is subsequently used for fine-tuning.\nWe train a massively multilingual NMT system which is capable of translating between a large number of language pairs at the same time by optimizing the translation objective between language pairs. To train such a multilingual system within a single model, we use the strategy proposed in BIBREF3 which suggests prepending a target language token to every source sequence to be translated. This simple and effective strategy enables us to share the encoder, decoder, and attention mechanisms across all language pairs.\nWe train our multilingual NMT system on a massive scale, using an in-house corpus generated by crawling and extracting parallel sentences from the web BIBREF14. This corpus contains parallel documents for 102 languages, to and from English, comprising a total of 25 billion sentence pairs. The number of parallel sentences per language in our corpus ranges from around 35 thousand to almost 2 billion. Figure FIGREF10 illustrates the data distribution for all 204 language pairs used to train the NMT model. Language ids for all the languages are also provided in supplementary material.\nGiven the wide distribution of data across language pairs, we used a temperature based data balancing strategy. For a given language pair, $l$, let $D_l$ be the size of the available parallel corpus. Then if we adopt a naive strategy and sample from the union of the datasets, the probability of the sample being from language pair $l$ will be $p_l=\\frac{D_l}{\\Sigma _lD_l}$. However, this strategy would starve low resource language pairs. To control for the ratio of samples from different language pairs, we sample a fixed number of sentences from the training data, with the probability of a sentence belonging to language pair $l$ being proportional to $p_l^{\\frac{1}{T}}$, where $T$ is the sampling temperature. As a result, $T=1$ would correspond to a true data distribution, and, $T=100$ yields an (almost) equal number of samples for each language pair (close to a uniform distribution with over-sampling for low-resource language-pairs). We set $T=5$ for a balanced sampling strategy. To control the contribution of each language pair when constructing the vocabulary, we use the same temperature based sampling strategy with $T=5$. Our SPM vocabulary has a character coverage of $0.999995$.\nWe use BLEU score BIBREF15 to evaluate the quality of our translation model(s). Our mNMT model performs worse than the bilingual baseline on high resource language pairs but improves upon it on low resource language pairs. The average drop in BLEU score on 204 language pairs as compared to bilingual baselines is just 0.25 BLEU. This is impressive considering we are comparing one multilingual model to 204 different bilingual models. Table TABREF14 compares the BLEU scores achieved by mNMT to that of the bilingual baselines on 10 representative language pairs. These scores are obtained on an internal evaluation set which contains around 5k examples per language pair.\nFine-tuning involves taking the encoder of our mNMT model, named Massively Multilingual Translation Encoder (MMTE), and adapting it to the downstream task. For tasks which involve single input, the text is directly fed into the encoder. For tasks such as entailment which involve input pairs, we concatenate the two inputs using a separator token and pass this through the encoder. For each downstream task, the inputs and outputs are passed through the encoder and we fine-tune all the parameters end-to-end. The encoder encodes the input through the stack of Transformer layers and produces representations for each token at the output. For sequence tagging tasks, these token level representations are individually fed into a task-specific output layer. For classification or entailment tasks, we apply max-pooling on the token level representations and feed this into the task-specific output layer.\nIt should be noted that fine-tuning is relatively inexpensive and fast. All of the results can be obtained within a few thousand gradient steps. The individual task-specific modeling details are described in detail in section SECREF3. It is also important to note that while the encoder, the attention mechanism, and the decoder of the model are trained in the pre-training phase, only the encoder is used during fine-tuning.\nWe point out some of the major difference between mBERT and MMTE are:\nmBERT uses two unsupervised pre-training objectives called masked language modeling (MLM) and next sentence prediction (NSP) which are both trained on monolingual data in 104 languages. MMTE on the other hand uses parallel data in 103 languages (102 languages to and from English) for supervised training with negative log-likelihood as the loss. It should be noted that mBERT uses clean Wikipedia data while MMTE is pre-trained on noisy parallel data from the web.\nmBERT uses 12 transformer layers, 12 attention heads, 768 hidden dimensions and has 178M parameters while MMTE uses 6 transformer layers, 16 attention heads, and 8196 hidden dimensions with 190M parameters. Note that, the effective capacity of these two models cannot easily be compared by simply counting number of parameters, due to the added characteristic complexity with depth and width.\nMMTE uses SPM to tokenize input with 64k vocabulary size while mBERT uses a Wordpiece model BIBREF16 with 110k vocabulary size.\nAs stated earlier, we use MMTE to perform downstream cross-lingual transfer on 5 NLP tasks. These include 3 classification tasks: NLI (XNLI dataset), document classification (MLDoc dataset) and intent classification, and 2 sequence tagging tasks: POS tagging and NER. We detail all of the experiments in this section.\nXNLI is a popularly used corpus for evaluating cross-lingual sentence classification. It contains data in 15 languages BIBREF17. Evaluation is based on classification accuracy for pairs of sentences as one of entailment, neutral, or contradiction. We feed the text pair separated by a special token into MMTE and add a small network on top of it to build a classifier. This small network consists of a pre-pool feed-forward layer with 64 units, a max-pool layer which pools word level representations to get the sentence representation, and a post-pool feed-forward layer with 64 units. The optimizer used is Adafactor with a learning rate schedule of (0.2, 90k). The classifier is trained on English only and evaluated on all the 15 languages. Results are reported in Table TABREF21. Please refer to Appedix Table 1 for language names associated with the codes.\nMMTE outperforms mBERT on 9 out of 15 languages and by 1.2 points on average. BERT achieves excellent results on English, outperforming our system by 2.5 points but its zero-shot cross-lingual transfer performance is weaker than MMTE. We see most gains in low resource languages such as ar, hi, ur, and sw. MMTE however falls short of the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) on XNLI BIBREF19. We hypothesize this might be because of 2 reasons: (1) They use only the 15 languages associated with the XNLI task for pre-training their model, and (2) They use both monolingual and parallel data for pre-training while we just use parallel data. We confirm our first hypothesis later in Section SECREF4 where we see that decreasing the number of languages in mNMT improves the performance on XNLI.\nMLDoc is a balanced subset of the Reuters corpus covering 8 languages for document classification BIBREF8. This is a 4-way classification task of identifying topics between CCAT (Corporate/Industrial), ECAT (Economics), GCAT (Government/Social), and MCAT (Markets). Performance is evaluated based on classification accuracy. We split the document using the sentence-piece model and feed the first 200 tokens into the encoder for classification. The task-specific network and the optimizer used is same as the one used for XNLI. Learning rate schedule is (0.2,5k). We perform both in-language and zero-shot evaluation. The in-language setting has training, development and test sets from the language. In the zero-shot setting, the train and dev sets contain only English examples but we test on all the languages. The results of both the experiments are reported in Table TABREF23.\nMMTE performance is on par with mBERT for in-language training on all the languages. It slightly edges over mBERT on zero-shot transfer while lagging behind SOTA by 0.2 points. Interestingly, MMTE beats SOTA on Japanese by more than 8 points. This may be due to the different nature and amount of data used for pre-training by these methods.\nBIBREF7 recently presented a dataset for multilingual task oriented dialog. This dataset contains 57k annotated utterances in English (43k), Spanish (8.6k), and Thai (5k) with 12 different intents across the domains weather, alarm, and reminder. The evaluation metric used is classification accuracy. We use this data for both in-language training and zero-shot transfer. The task-specific network and the optimizer used is the same as the one used for the above two tasks. The learning rate schedule is (0.1,100k). Results are reported in Table TABREF25. MMTE outperforms both mBERT and previous SOTA in both in-language and zero-shot setting on all 3 languages and establishes a new SOTA for this dataset.\nWe use universal dependencies POS tagging data from the Universal Dependency v2.3 BIBREF6, BIBREF20. Gold segmentation is used for training, tuning and testing. The POS tagging task has 17 labels for all languages. We consider 48 different languages. These languages are chosen based on intersection of languages for which POS labels are available in the universal dependencies dataset and the languages supported by our mNMT model. The task-specific network consists of a one layer feed-forward neural network with 784 units. Since MMTE operates on the subword-level, we only consider the representation of the first subword token of each word. The optimizer used is Adafactor with learning rate schedule (0.1,40k). The evaluation metric used is F1-score, which is same as accuracy in our case since we use gold-segmented data. Results of both in-language and zero-shot setting are reported in Table TABREF27.\nWhile mBERT outperforms MMTE on in-language training by a small margin of 0.16 points, MMTE beats mBERT by nearly 0.6 points in the zero-shot setting. Similar to results in XNLI, we see MMTE outperform mBERT on low resource languages. Since mBERT is SOTA for zero-shot cross-lingual transfer on POS tagging task BIBREF18, we also establish state-of-the-art on this dataset by beating mBERT in this setting.\nFor NER, we use the dataset from the CoNLL 2002 and 2003 NER shared tasks, which when combined have 4 languages BIBREF21, BIBREF22. The labeling scheme is IOB with 4 types of named entities. The task-specific network, optimizer, and the learning rate schedule is the same as in the setup for POS tagging. The evaluation metric is span-based F1. Table TABREF29 reports the results of both in-language and zero-shot settings.\nMMTE performs significantly worse than mBERT on the NER task in all languages. On average, mBERT beats MMTE by 7 F1 points in the in-language setting and by more than 18 points in the zero-shot setting. We hypothesize that this might be because of two reasons: (1) mBERT is trained on clean Wikipedia data which is entity-rich while MMTE is trained on noisy web data with fewer entities, and (2) the translation task just copies the entities from the source to the target and therefore might not be able to accurately recognize them. This result points to the importance of the type of pre-training data and objective on down-stream task performance. We plan to investigate this further in future work.\nIn this section, we consider some additional settings for comparing mBERT and MMTE. We also investigate the impact of the number of languages and the target language token on MMTE performance.\nIn this setting, instead of fine-tuning the entire network of mBERT or MMTE, we only fine-tune the task-specific network which only has a small percentage of the total number of parameters. The rest of the model parameters are frozen. We perform this experiment on POS tagging task by fine-tuning a single layer feed-forward neural network stacked on top of mBERT and MMTE. We report the results in Table TABREF31. While the scores of the feature-based approach are significantly lower than those obtained via full fine-tuning (TABREF27), we see that MMTE still outperforms mBERT on both in-language and zero-shot settings by an even bigger margin. This is particularly interesting as the feature-based approach has its own advantages: 1) it is applicable to downstream tasks which require significant task-specific parameters on top of a transformer encoder, 2) it is computationally cheaper to train and tune the downstream model, and 3) it is compact and scalable since we only need a small number of task-specific parameters.\nWhile zero-shot transfer is a good measure of a model's natural cross-lingual effectiveness, the more practical setting is the few-shot transfer scenario as we almost always have access to, or can cheaply acquire, a small amount of data in the target language. We report the few-shot transfer results of mBERT and MMTE on the POS tagging dataset in TABREF33. To simulate the few-shot setting, in addition to using English data, we use 10 examples from each language (upsampled to 1000). MMTE outperforms mBERT in few-shot setting by 0.6 points averaged over 48 languages. Once again, we see that the gains are more pronounced in low resource languages.\nAnother setting of importance is the in-language training where instead of training one model for each language, we concatenate all the data and train one model jointly on all languages. We perform this experiment on the POS tagging dataset with 48 languages and report results in Table TABREF35. We observe that MMTE performance is on par with mBERT. We also find that the 48 language average improves by 0.2 points as compared to the one model per language setting in Table TABREF27.\nWe perform an ablation where we vary the number of languages used in the pre-training step. Apart from the 103 language setting, we consider 2 additional settings: 1) where we train mNMT on 4 languages to and from English, and 2) where we use 25 languages. The results are presented in Table TABREF37. We see that as we scale up the languages the zero-shot performance goes down on both POS tagging and XNLI tasks. These losses align with the relative BLEU scores of these models suggesting that the regressions are due to interference arising from the large number of languages attenuating the capacity of the NMT model. Scaling up the mNMT model to include more languages without diminishing cross-lingual effectiveness is a direction for future work.\nDuring the pre-training step, when we perform the translation task using the mNMT system, we prepend a $<$2xx$>$ token to the source sentence, where xx indicates the target language. The encoder therefore has always seen a $<$2en$>$ token in front of non-English sentences and variety of different tokens depending on the target language in front of English sentence. However, when fine-tuning on downstream tasks, we do not use this token. We believe this creates a mismatch between the pre-training and fine-tuning steps. To investigate this further, we perform a small scale study where we train an mNMT model on 4 languages to and from English in two different settings: 1) where we prepend the $<$2xx$>$ token, and 2) where we don't prepend the $<$2xx$>$ token but instead encode it separately. The decoder jointly attends over both the source sentence encoder and the $<$2xx$>$ token encoding. The BLEU scores on the translation tasks are comparable using both these approaches. The results on cross-lingual zero-shot transfer in both settings are provided in Table TABREF39. Removing the $<$2xx$>$ token from the source sentence during mNMT training improves cross-lingual effectiveness on both POS tagging and XNLI task. Training a massively multilingual NMT model that supports translation of 102 languages to and from English without using the $<$2xx$>$ token in the encoder is another direction for future work.\nWe briefly review widely used approaches in cross-lingual transfer learning and some of the recent work in learning contextual word representations (CWR).\nFor cross-lingual transfer, the most widely studied approach is to use multilingual word embeddings as features in neural network models. Several recent efforts have explored methods that align vector spaces for words in different languages BIBREF23, BIBREF24, BIBREF25.\nMore recent work has shown that CWRs obtained using unsupervised generative pre-training techniques such as language modeling or cloze task BIBREF26 have led to state-of-the-art results beyond what was achieved with traditional word type representations on many monolingual NLP tasks BIBREF27, BIBREF1, BIBREF28, BIBREF29 such as sentence classification, sequence tagging, and question answering. Subsequently, these contextual methods have been extended to produce multilingual representations by training a single model on text from multiple languages which have proven to be very effective for cross lingual transfer BIBREF18, BIBREF30, BIBREF31. BIBREF19 show that adding a translation language modeling (TLM) objective to mBERT's MLM objective utilizes both monolingual and parallel data to further improve the cross-lingual effectiveness.\nThe encoder from an NMT model has been used as yet another effective way to contextualize word vectors BIBREF32. Additionally, recent progress in NMT has enabled one to train multilingual NMT systems that support translation from multiple source languages into multiple target languages within a single model BIBREF3. Our work is more closely related to two very recent works which explore the encoder from multilingual NMT model for cross-lingual transfer learning BIBREF4, BIBREF5. While BIBREF4 also consider multilingual systems, they do so on a much smaller scale, training it on only 2 languages. BIBREF5 uses a large scale model comparable to ours with 93 languages but they constrain the model by pooling encoder representations and therefore only obtain a single vector per sequence. Neither of these approaches have been used on token level sequence tagging tasks. Further, neither concern themselves with the performance of the actual translation task whereas we our mNMT model performs comparable to bilingual baselines in terms of translation quality.\nWe train a massively multilingual NMT system using parallel data from 103 languages and exploit representations extracted from the encoder for cross-lingual transfer on various classification and sequence tagging tasks spanning over 50 languages. We find that the positive language transfer visible in improved translation quality for low resource languages is also reflected in the cross-lingual transferability of the extracted representations. The gains observed on various tasks over mBERT suggest that the translation objective is competitive with specialized approaches to learn cross-lingual embeddings.\nWe find that there is a trade off between the number of languages in the multilingual model and efficiency of the learned representations due to the limited capacity. Scaling up the model to include more languages without diminishing transfer learning capability is a direction for future work. Finally, one could also consider integrating mBERT's objective with the translation objective to pre-train the mNMT system.\nIn this section we provide the list of languages codes used throughout this paper and the statistics of the datasets used for the downstream tasks.", "question": "What are the five downstream tasks?", "expected_output": "These include 3 classification tasks: NLI (XNLI dataset), document classification (MLDoc dataset) and intent classification, and 2 sequence tagging tasks: POS tagging and NER..

{"id": "1909.00437", "prompt": "English has an abundance of labeled data that can be used for various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, such as part-of-speech tagging (POS), named entity recognition (NER), and natural language inference (NLI). This richness of labeled data manifests itself as a boost in accuracy in the current era of data-hungry deep learning algorithms. However, the same is not true for many other languages where task specific data is scarce and expensive to acquire. This motivates the need for cross-lingual transfer learning \u2013 the ability to leverage the knowledge from task specific data available in one or more languages to solve that task in languages with little or no task-specific data.\nRecent progress in NMT has enabled one to train multilingual systems that support translation from multiple source languages into multiple target languages within a single model BIBREF2, BIBREF3, BIBREF0. Such multilingual NMT (mNMT) systems often demonstrate large improvements in translation quality on low resource languages. This positive transfer originates from the model's ability to learn representations which are transferable across languages. Previous work has shown that these representations can then be used for cross-lingual transfer in other downstream NLP tasks - albeit on only a pair of language pairs BIBREF4, or by limiting the decoder to use a pooled vector representation of the entire sentence from the encoder BIBREF5.\nIn this paper we scale up the number of translation directions used in the NMT model to include 102 languages to and from English. Unlike BIBREF5, we do not apply any restricting operations such as pooling while training mNMT which allows us to obtain token level representations making it possible to transfer them to sequence tagging tasks as well. We find that mNMT models trained using plain translation losses can out of the box emerge as competitive alternatives to other methods at the forefront of cross-lingual transfer learning BIBREF1, BIBREF5\nOur contributions in this paper are threefold:\nWe use representations from a Massively Multilingual Translation Encoder (MMTE) that can handle 103 languages to achieve cross-lingual transfer on 5 classification and sequence tagging tasks spanning more than 50 languages.\nWe compare MMTE to mBERT in different cross-lingual transfer scenarios including zero-shot, few-shot, fine-tuning, and feature extraction scenarios.\nWe outperform the state-of-the-art on zero-shot cross-lingual POS tagging [Universal Dependencies 2.3 dataset BIBREF6], intent classification BIBREF7, and achieve results comparable to state-of-the-art on document classification [ML-Doc dataset BIBREF8].\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section SECREF2 describes our MMTE model in detail and points out its differences from mBERT. All experimental details, results and analysis are given in Sections SECREF3 and SECREF4. This is followed by a discussion of related work. In Section SECREF6, we summarize our findings and present directions for future research. We emphasize that the primary motivation of the paper is not to challenge the state-of-the-art but instead to investigate the effectiveness of representations learned from an mNMT model in various transfer-learning settings.\nIn this section, we describe our massively multilingual NMT system. Similar to BERT, our transfer learning setup has two distinct steps: pre-training and fine-tuning. During pre-training, the NMT model is trained on large amounts of parallel data to perform translation. During fine-tuning, we initialize our downstream model with the pre-trained parameters from the encoder of the NMT system, and then all of the parameters are fine-tuned using labeled data from the downstream tasks.\nWe train our Massively Multilingual NMT system using the Transformer architecture BIBREF9 in the open-source implementation under the Lingvo framework BIBREF10. We use a larger version of Transformer Big containing 375M parameters (6 layers, 16 heads, 8192 hidden dimension) BIBREF11, and a shared source-target sentence-piece model (SPM) BIBREF12 vocabulary with 64k individual tokens. All our models are trained with Adafactor BIBREF13 with momentum factorization, a learning rate schedule of (3.0, 40k) and a per-parameter norm clipping threshold of 1.0. The encoder of this NMT model comprises approximately 190M parameters and is subsequently used for fine-tuning.\nWe train a massively multilingual NMT system which is capable of translating between a large number of language pairs at the same time by optimizing the translation objective between language pairs. To train such a multilingual system within a single model, we use the strategy proposed in BIBREF3 which suggests prepending a target language token to every source sequence to be translated. This simple and effective strategy enables us to share the encoder, decoder, and attention mechanisms across all language pairs.\nWe train our multilingual NMT system on a massive scale, using an in-house corpus generated by crawling and extracting parallel sentences from the web BIBREF14. This corpus contains parallel documents for 102 languages, to and from English, comprising a total of 25 billion sentence pairs. The number of parallel sentences per language in our corpus ranges from around 35 thousand to almost 2 billion. Figure FIGREF10 illustrates the data distribution for all 204 language pairs used to train the NMT model. Language ids for all the languages are also provided in supplementary material.\nGiven the wide distribution of data across language pairs, we used a temperature based data balancing strategy. For a given language pair, $l$, let $D_l$ be the size of the available parallel corpus. Then if we adopt a naive strategy and sample from the union of the datasets, the probability of the sample being from language pair $l$ will be $p_l=\\frac{D_l}{\\Sigma _lD_l}$. However, this strategy would starve low resource language pairs. To control for the ratio of samples from different language pairs, we sample a fixed number of sentences from the training data, with the probability of a sentence belonging to language pair $l$ being proportional to $p_l^{\\frac{1}{T}}$, where $T$ is the sampling temperature. As a result, $T=1$ would correspond to a true data distribution, and, $T=100$ yields an (almost) equal number of samples for each language pair (close to a uniform distribution with over-sampling for low-resource language-pairs). We set $T=5$ for a balanced sampling strategy. To control the contribution of each language pair when constructing the vocabulary, we use the same temperature based sampling strategy with $T=5$. Our SPM vocabulary has a character coverage of $0.999995$.\nWe use BLEU score BIBREF15 to evaluate the quality of our translation model(s). Our mNMT model performs worse than the bilingual baseline on high resource language pairs but improves upon it on low resource language pairs. The average drop in BLEU score on 204 language pairs as compared to bilingual baselines is just 0.25 BLEU. This is impressive considering we are comparing one multilingual model to 204 different bilingual models. Table TABREF14 compares the BLEU scores achieved by mNMT to that of the bilingual baselines on 10 representative language pairs. These scores are obtained on an internal evaluation set which contains around 5k examples per language pair.\nFine-tuning involves taking the encoder of our mNMT model, named Massively Multilingual Translation Encoder (MMTE), and adapting it to the downstream task. For tasks which involve single input, the text is directly fed into the encoder. For tasks such as entailment which involve input pairs, we concatenate the two inputs using a separator token and pass this through the encoder. For each downstream task, the inputs and outputs are passed through the encoder and we fine-tune all the parameters end-to-end. The encoder encodes the input through the stack of Transformer layers and produces representations for each token at the output. For sequence tagging tasks, these token level representations are individually fed into a task-specific output layer. For classification or entailment tasks, we apply max-pooling on the token level representations and feed this into the task-specific output layer.\nIt should be noted that fine-tuning is relatively inexpensive and fast. All of the results can be obtained within a few thousand gradient steps. The individual task-specific modeling details are described in detail in section SECREF3. It is also important to note that while the encoder, the attention mechanism, and the decoder of the model are trained in the pre-training phase, only the encoder is used during fine-tuning.\nWe point out some of the major difference between mBERT and MMTE are:\nmBERT uses two unsupervised pre-training objectives called masked language modeling (MLM) and next sentence prediction (NSP) which are both trained on monolingual data in 104 languages. MMTE on the other hand uses parallel data in 103 languages (102 languages to and from English) for supervised training with negative log-likelihood as the loss.

Once again, we see that the gains are more pronounced in low resource languages.\nAnother setting of importance is the in-language training where instead of training one model for each language, we concatenate all the data and train one model jointly on all languages. We perform this experiment on the POS tagging dataset with 48 languages and report results in Table TABREF35. We observe that MMTE performance is on par with mBERT. We also find that the 48 language average improves by 0.2 points as compared to the one model per language setting in Table TABREF27.\nWe perform an ablation where we vary the number of languages used in the pre-training step. Apart from the 103 language setting, we consider 2 additional settings: 1) where we train mNMT on 4 languages to and from English, and 2) where we use 25 languages. The results are presented in Table TABREF37. We see that as we scale up the languages the zero-shot performance goes down on both POS tagging and XNLI tasks. These losses align with the relative BLEU scores of these models suggesting that the regressions are due to interference arising from the large number of languages attenuating the capacity of the NMT model. Scaling up the mNMT model to include more languages without diminishing cross-lingual effectiveness is a direction for future work.\nDuring the pre-training step, when we perform the translation task using the mNMT system, we prepend a $<$2xx$>$ token to the source sentence, where xx indicates the target language. The encoder therefore has always seen a $<$2en$>$ token in front of non-English sentences and variety of different tokens depending on the target language in front of English sentence. However, when fine-tuning on downstream tasks, we do not use this token. We believe this creates a mismatch between the pre-training and fine-tuning steps. To investigate this further, we perform a small scale study where we train an mNMT model on 4 languages to and from English in two different settings: 1) where we prepend the $<$2xx$>$ token, and 2) where we don't prepend the $<$2xx$>$ token but instead encode it separately. The decoder jointly attends over both the source sentence encoder and the $<$2xx$>$ token encoding. The BLEU scores on the translation tasks are comparable using both these approaches. The results on cross-lingual zero-shot transfer in both settings are provided in Table TABREF39. Removing the $<$2xx$>$ token from the source sentence during mNMT training improves cross-lingual effectiveness on both POS tagging and XNLI task. Training a massively multilingual NMT model that supports translation of 102 languages to and from English without using the $<$2xx$>$ token in the encoder is another direction for future work.\nWe briefly review widely used approaches in cross-lingual transfer learning and some of the recent work in learning contextual word representations (CWR).\nFor cross-lingual transfer, the most widely studied approach is to use multilingual word embeddings as features in neural network models. Several recent efforts have explored methods that align vector spaces for words in different languages BIBREF23, BIBREF24, BIBREF25.\nMore recent work has shown that CWRs obtained using unsupervised generative pre-training techniques such as language modeling or cloze task BIBREF26 have led to state-of-the-art results beyond what was achieved with traditional word type representations on many monolingual NLP tasks BIBREF27, BIBREF1, BIBREF28, BIBREF29 such as sentence classification, sequence tagging, and question answering. Subsequently, these contextual methods have been extended to produce multilingual representations by training a single model on text from multiple languages which have proven to be very effective for cross lingual transfer BIBREF18, BIBREF30, BIBREF31. BIBREF19 show that adding a translation language modeling (TLM) objective to mBERT's MLM objective utilizes both monolingual and parallel data to further improve the cross-lingual effectiveness.\nThe encoder from an NMT model has been used as yet another effective way to contextualize word vectors BIBREF32. Additionally, recent progress in NMT has enabled one to train multilingual NMT systems that support translation from multiple source languages into multiple target languages within a single model BIBREF3. Our work is more closely related to two very recent works which explore the encoder from multilingual NMT model for cross-lingual transfer learning BIBREF4, BIBREF5. While BIBREF4 also consider multilingual systems, they do so on a much smaller scale, training it on only 2 languages. BIBREF5 uses a large scale model comparable to ours with 93 languages but they constrain the model by pooling encoder representations and therefore only obtain a single vector per sequence. Neither of these approaches have been used on token level sequence tagging tasks. Further, neither concern themselves with the performance of the actual translation task whereas we our mNMT model performs comparable to bilingual baselines in terms of translation quality.\nWe train a massively multilingual NMT system using parallel data from 103 languages and exploit representations extracted from the encoder for cross-lingual transfer on various classification and sequence tagging tasks spanning over 50 languages. We find that the positive language transfer visible in improved translation quality for low resource languages is also reflected in the cross-lingual transferability of the extracted representations. The gains observed on various tasks over mBERT suggest that the translation objective is competitive with specialized approaches to learn cross-lingual embeddings.\nWe find that there is a trade off between the number of languages in the multilingual model and efficiency of the learned representations due to the limited capacity. Scaling up the model to include more languages without diminishing transfer learning capability is a direction for future work. Finally, one could also consider integrating mBERT's objective with the translation objective to pre-train the mNMT system.\nIn this section we provide the list of languages codes used throughout this paper and the statistics of the datasets used for the downstream tasks.", "question": "How did they select the 50 languages they test?", "expected_output": "These languages are chosen based on intersection of languages for which POS labels are available in the universal dependencies dataset and the languages supported by our mNMT model.

This progress has been catalyzed thanks to existing conversational dataset such as Persona-chat BIBREF0, BIBREF1. However, the training data are provided in a single language (e.g., English), and thus the resulting systems can perform conversations only in the training language. For wide, commercial dialogue systems are required to handle a large number of languages since the smart home devices market is increasingly international BIBREF2. Therefore, creating multilingual conversational benchmarks is essential, yet challenging since it is costly to perform human annotation of data in all languages.\nA possible solution is to use translation systems before and after the model inference, a two-step translation from any language to English and from English to any language. This comes with three major problems: 1) amplification of translation errors since the current dialogue systems are far from perfect, especially with noisy input; 2) the three-stage pipeline system is significantly slower in terms of inference speed; and 3) high translation costs since the current state-of-the-art models, especially in low resources languages, are only available using costly APIs.\nIn this paper, we analyze two possible workarounds to alleviate the aforementioned challenges. The first is to build a cross-lingual transferable system by aligning cross-lingual representations, as in BIBREF3, in which the system is trained on one language and zero-shot to another language. The second is to learn a multilingual system directly from noisy multilingual data (e.g., translated data), thus getting rid of the translation system dependence at inference time.\nTo evaluate the aforementioned systems, we propose a dataset called Multilingual Persona-Chat, or XPersona, by extending the Persona-Chat corpora BIBREF1 to six languages: Chinese, French, Indonesian, Italian, Korean, and Japanese. In XPersona, the training sets are automatically translated using translation APIs with several human-in-the-loop passes of mistake correction.

Interested readers may refer to BIBREF11 for a general overview. In this paper, we focus on the latter, for which, in recent years, several tasks and datasets have been proposed to ground the conversation on knowledge BIBREF12, BIBREF13, BIBREF14, BIBREF15, BIBREF16, BIBREF17, BIBREF18 such as Wiki-Articles, Reddit-Post, and CNN-Article. In this work, we focus on personalized dialogue agents where the dialogues are grounded on persona information.\nBIBREF19 was the first to introduce a persona-grounded dialogue dataset for improving response consistency. Later on, BIBREF0 and BIBREF1 introduced Persona-chat, a multi-turn conversational dataset, where two speakers are paired, and a persona description (4\u20135 sentences) is randomly assigned to each of them. By conditioning the response generation on the persona descriptions, a chit-chat model is able to produce a more persona-consistent dialogue BIBREF0. Several works have improved on the initial baselines with various methodologies BIBREF20, BIBREF21, BIBREF22, BIBREF23, BIBREF24, BIBREF25, especially using large pre-trained models BIBREF26, BIBREF27.\nExtensive approaches have been introduced to construct multilingual systems, for example, multilingual semantic role labeling BIBREF28, BIBREF29, multilingual machine translation BIBREF30, multilingual automatic speech recognition BIBREF31, BIBREF32, BIBREF33, BIBREF34, and named entity recognition BIBREF35, BIBREF36. Multilingual deep contextualized model such as Multilingual BERT (M-BERT) BIBREF5 have been commonly used to represent multiple languages and elevate the performance in many NLP applications, such as classification tasks BIBREF37, textual entailment, named entity recognition BIBREF38, and natural language understanding BIBREF39. Multilingual datasets have also been created for a number of NLP tasks, such as named entity recognition or linking BIBREF40, BIBREF41, BIBREF42, BIBREF43, question answering BIBREF44, BIBREF45, semantic role labeling BIBREF46, part-of-speech tagging BIBREF47, dialogue state tracking BIBREF48, and natural language understanding BIBREF49. However, none of these datasets include the multilingual chit-chat task.\nCross-lingual adaptation learns the inter-connections among languages and circumvents the requirement of extensive training data in target languages BIBREF50, BIBREF51, BIBREF52. Cross-lingual transfer learning methods have been applied to multiple NLP tasks, such as named entity recognition BIBREF53, BIBREF54, natural language understanding BIBREF39, dialogue state tracking BIBREF55, part-of-speech tagging BIBREF50, BIBREF51, BIBREF56, and dependency parsing BIBREF57, BIBREF58. Meanwhile, BIBREF59 and BIBREF60 proposed pre-trained cross-lingual language models to align multiple language representations, achieving state-of-the-art results in many cross-lingual classification tasks. The aforementioned tasks focused on classification and sequence labeling, while instead, BIBREF4 proposed to pre-train both the encoder and decoder of a sequence-to-sequence model (XNLG) to conduct cross-lingual generation tasks, namely, question generation and abstractive summarization. The latter is the closest to our task since it focuses on language generation; however cross-lingual dialogue generation has not yet been explored.\nThe proposed XPersona dataset is an extension of the persona-chat dataset BIBREF0, BIBREF1. Specifically, we extend the ConvAI2 BIBREF1 to six languages: Chinese, French, Indonesian, Italian, Korean, and Japanese. Since the test set of ConvAI2 is hidden, we split the original validation set into a new validation set and test sets. Then, we firstly automatically translate the training, validation, and test set using APIs (PapaGo for Korean, Google Translate for other languages). For each language, we hired native speaker annotators with a fluent level of English and asked them to revise the machine-translated dialogues and persona sentences in the validation set and test set according to original English dialogues. The main goal of human annotation is to ensure the resulting conversations are coherent and fluent despite the cultural differences in target languages. Therefore, annotators are not restricted to only translate the English dialogues, and they are allowed to modify the original dialogues to improve the dialogue coherence in the corresponding language while retaining the persona information. The full annotation instructions are reported in Appendix A.\nCompared to collecting new persona sentences and dialogues in each language, human-annotating the dialogues by leveraging translation APIs has multiple advantages. First, it increases the data distribution similarity across languages BIBREF3, which can better examine the system's cross-lingual transferability. Second, revising the machine-translated dialogues based on the original English dialogue improves the data construction efficiency. Third, it leverages the well-constructed English persona conversations as a reference to ensure the dialogue quality without the need for training a new pool of workers to generate new samples BIBREF3.\nOn the other hand, human-translating the entire training-set ($\\sim $130K utterances) in six languages is expensive. Therefore, we propose an iterative method to improve the quality of the automatically translated training set. We firstly sample 200 dialogues from the training set ($\\sim $2600 utterances) in each language, and we assign human annotators to list all frequent translation mistakes in the given dialogues. For example, daily colloquial English expressions such as \u201ccool\", \u201cI see\", and \u201clol\" are usually literally translated. After that, we use a simple string matching to revise the inappropriate translations in the whole training-set and return a revision log, which records all the revised utterances. Then, we assign human annotators to check all the revised utterances and list translation mistakes again. We repeat this process at least twice for each language. Finally, we summarize the statistics of the collected dataset in Table TABREF6.\nLet us define a dialogue $\\mathcal {D}=\\lbrace U_1,S_1,U_2,S_2, \\dots , U_n, S_n\\rbrace $ as an alternating set of utterances from two speakers, where $U$ and $S$ represent the user and the system, respectively. Each speaker has its corresponding persona description that consists of a set of sentences $\\mathcal {P}=\\lbrace P_1,\\dots ,P_m\\rbrace $. Given the system persona sentences $\\mathcal {P}_s$ and dialogue history $\\mathcal {D}_t=\\lbrace U_1,S_1,U_2, \\dots ,S_{t-1}, U_t\\rbrace $, we are interested in predicting the system utterances $S_t$.\nWe explore both encoder-decoder and causal decoder architectures, and we leverage existing pre-trained contextualized multilingual language models as weights initialization. Hence, we firstly define the multilingual embedding layer and then the two multilingual models used in our experiments.\nWe define three embedding matrices: word embedding $E^W\\in \\mathbb {R}^{|V| \\times d}$, positional embedding $E^P\\in \\mathbb {R}^{M \\times d}$, and segmentation embedding $E^S\\in \\mathbb {R}^{|S| \\times d}$, where $|.|$ denotes set cardinality, $d$ is the embedding size, $V$ denotes the vocabulary, $M$ denotes the maximum sequence length, and $S$ denotes the set of segmentation tokens. Segmentation embedding BIBREF26 is used to indicate whether the current token is part of i) Persona sentences, ii) System (Sys.) utterances, iii) User utterances, iv) response in Language $l_{id}$. The language embedding $l_{id}$ is used to inform the model which language to generate. Hence, given a sequence of tokens $X$, the embedding functions $E$ are defined as:\nwhere $\\oplus $ denotes the positional sum, $X_{pos}=\\lbrace 1,\\dots ,|X|\\rbrace $ and $X_{seg}$ is the sequence of segmentation tokens, as in BIBREF26. Figure FIGREF9 shows a visual representation of the embedding process. A more detailed illustration is reported in Appendix B.\nTo model the response generation, we use a Transformer BIBREF61 based encoder-decoder BIBREF10. As illustrated in Figure FIGREF9, we concatenate the system persona $\\mathcal {P}_s$ with the dialogue history $\\mathcal {D}_t$. Then we use the embedding layer $E$ to finally pass it to the encoder. In short, we have:\nwhere $H \\in \\mathbb {R}^{L \\times d_{model}}$ is the hidden representation computed by the encoder, and $L$ denotes the input sequence length. Then, the decoder attends to $H$ and generates the system response $S_t$ token by token. In the decoder, segmentation embedding is the language ID embedding (e.g., we look up the embedding for Italian to decode Italian). Thus:\nAs an alternative to encoder-decoders, the causal-decoders BIBREF62, BIBREF63, BIBREF64 have been used to model conversational responses BIBREF26, BIBREF27 by giving as a prefix the dialogue history. In our model, we concatenate the persona $\\mathcal {P}_s$ and the dialogue history $\\mathcal {D}_t$ as the language model prefix, and autoregressively decode the system response $S_t$ based on language embedding (i.e. $l_{id}$):\nFigure FIGREF9 shows the conceptual differences between the encoder-decoder and casual decoder. Note that in both multilingual models, the dialogue history encoding process is language-agnostic, while decoding language is controlled by the language embedding. Such design allows the model to understand mixed-language dialogue contexts and to responds in the desired language (details in Section SECREF44).\nWe consider two training strategies to learn a multilingual conversational model: multilingual training and cross-lingual training.\njointly learns to perform personalized conversations in multiple languages. We follow a transfer learning approach BIBREF26, BIBREF65 by initializing our models with the weights of the large multilingual pretrained model M-Bert BIBREF37. For the causal decoder, we add the causal mask into self-attention layer to convert M-Bert encoder to decoder. For encoder-decoder model, we randomly initialize the cross encoder-decoder attention BIBREF66. Then, we train the both models on the combined training set in all 7 languages using cross-entropy loss.\ntransfers knowledge from the source language data to the target languages. In this setting, the model is trained on English (source language) conversational samples, and evaluated on the other 6 languages. Following the methodology proposed by BIBREF4, we align the embedded representations of different languages into the same embedding space by applying cross-lingual pre-training to the encoder-decoder model. The pre-training procedure consists of two stages:\npre-training the encoder and the decoder independently utilizing masked language modeling, as in BIBREF59;\njointly pre-training the encoder-decoder by using two objective functions: Cross-Lingual Auto-Encoding (XAE) and Denoising Auto-Encoding (DAE) BIBREF4.\nFor instance, DAE adds perturbations to the input sentence and tries to reconstructs the original sentence using the decoder, whereas, XAE uses parallel translation data as the supervision signal to pre-train both the encoder and decoder. As in the multilingual models, the language IDs are fed into the decoder to control the language of generated sentences. Both pre-training stages require both parallel and non-parallel data in the target language.\nAfter the two stages of pre-training, the model is fine-tuned using just the source language samples (i.e., English) with the same cross-entropy loss as for the multilingual training. However, as suggested in BIBREF4, only the encoder parameters are updated with back-propagation and both the decoder and the word embedding layer remain frozen. This retains the decoders' ability to generate multilingual output while still being able to learn new tasks using only the target language.\nEvaluating open-domain chit-chat models is challenging, especially in multiple languages and at the dialogue-level. Hence, we evaluate our models using both automatic and human evaluation. In both cases, human-annotated dialogues are used, which show the importance of the provided dataset.\nFor each language, we evaluate responses generated by the models using perplexity (ppl.) and BLEU BIBREF67 with reference to the human-annotated responses. Although these automatic measures are not perfect BIBREF68, they help to roughly estimate the performance of different models under the same test set. More recently, BIBREF69 has shown the correlation between perplexity and human judgment in open-domain chit-chat models.\nAsking humans to evaluate the quality of a dialogue model is challenging, especially when multiple models have to be compared. The likert score (a.k.a. 1 to 5 scoring) has been widely used to evaluate the interactive experience with conversational models BIBREF70, BIBREF65, BIBREF0, BIBREF1. In such evaluation, a human interacts with the systems for several turns, and then they assign a score from 1 to 5 based on three questions BIBREF0 about fluency, engagingness, and consistency. This evaluation is both expensive to conduct and requires many samples to achieve statistically significant results BIBREF6. To cope with these issues, BIBREF6 proposed ACUTE-EVAL, an A/B test evaluation for dialogue systems. The authors proposed two modes: human-model chats and self-chat BIBREF71, BIBREF72. In this work, we opt for the latter since it is cheaper to conduct and achieves similar results BIBREF6 to the former. Another advantage of using this method is the ability to evaluate multi-turn conversations instead of single-turn responses.\nFollowing ACUTE-EVAL, the annotator is provided with two full dialogues made by self-chat or human-dialogue. The annotator is asked to choose which of the two dialogues is better in terms of engagingness, interestingness, and humanness. For each comparison, we sample 60\u2013100 conversations from both models. In Appendix C, we report the exact questions and instructions given to the annotators, and the user interface used in the evaluation. We hired native speakers annotators for all six considered languages. The annotators were different from the dataset collection annotators to avoid any possible bias.\nWe use the \"BERT-Base, Multilingual Cased\" checkpoint, and we denote the multilingual encoder-decoder model as M-Bert2Bert ($\\sim $220M parameters) and causal decoder model as M-CausalBert ($\\sim $110M parameters). We fine-tune both models in the combined training set (English in Persona-chat BIBREF0, six languages in Xpersona) for five epochs with AdamW optimizer and a learning rate of $6.25e$-5.\nTo verify whether the multilingual agent will under-perform the monolingual agent in the monolingual conversational task, we build a monolingual encoder-decoder model and causal decoder model for each language. For a fair comparison, we initialize the monolingual models with a pre-trained monolingual BERT BIBREF5, BIBREF73, BIBREF74. We denote the monolingual encoder-decoder model as Bert2Bert ($\\sim $220M parameters) and causal decoder model as CausalBert ($\\sim $110M parameters). Then we fine-tune each model in each language independently for the same number of epoch and optimizer as the multilingual model.\nAnother strong baseline we compare with is Poly-encoder BIBREF75, a large-scale pre-trained retrieval model that has shown state-of-the-art performance in the English Persona-chat dataset BIBREF6. We adapt this model to the other languages by using the Google Translate API to translate target languages (e.g., Chinese) query to English as the input to the model, then translate the English response back to the target language. Thus, the response generation flow is: target query $\\rightarrow $ English query $\\rightarrow $ English response $\\rightarrow $ target response. We denote this model as Poly.\nIn the first pre-training stage, we use the pre-trained weights from XLMR-base BIBREF60. Then, we follow the second pre-training stage of XNLG BIBREF4 for pre-training Italian, Japanese, Korean, Indonesia cross-lingual transferable models. For Chinese and French, we directly apply the pre-trained XNLG BIBREF4 weights. Then, the pre-trained models are fine-tune on English PersonaChat training set and early stop based on the perplexity on target language validation set.\nTable TABREF20 compares monolingual, multilingual, and cross-lingual models in terms of BLEU and perplexity in the human-translated test set. On both evaluation matrices, the causal decoder models outperform the encoder-decoder models. We observe that the encoder-decoder model tends to overlook dialogue context and generate digressive responses. (Generated samples are available in Appendix D) We hypothesize that this is because the one-to-many problem BIBREF76 in open-domain conversation weakens the relation between encoder and decoder; thus the well pre-trained decoder (Bert) easily converges to a locally-optimal, and learns to ignore the dialogue context from the encoder and generate the response in an unconditional language model way. We leave the investigation of this problem to future work. On the other hand, M-CausalBert achieves a comparable or slightly better performance compared to CausalBert, which suggests that M-CausalBert leverages the data from other languages. As expected, we observe a significant gap between the cross-lingual model and other models, which indicates that cross-lingual zero-shot conversation modeling is very challenging.\nTable TABREF28 shows the human evaluation result of comparing M-CausalBert (Multi) against the human, translation-based Poly-encoder (Poly), and monolingual CausalBert (Mono). The results illustrate that Multi outperforms Mono in English and Chinese, and is on par with Mono in other languages. On the other hand, Poly shows a strong performance in English as it was pre-trained with a large-scale English conversation corpus. In contrast, the performance of Poly drops in other languages, which indicates that the imperfect translation affects translation-based systems.\nWe randomly sample 7 self-chat dialogues for each baseline model in the seven languages and report them in Appendix D., And we summarize the generation of each model as follows:\nPoly-encoder, pretrained on 174 million Reddit data, can accurately retrieve coherent and diverse responses in English. However, in the other six languages, some of the retrieved responses are digressive due to translation error.\nWe observe that both the monolingual and multilingual models can generate fluent responses. Compared to Bert2Bert and M-Bert2Bert, CausalBert and M-CausalBert can generate more on-topic responses but sometimes repeat through turns. CausalBert and M-CausalBert are on par with each other in monolingual conversational tasks, while M-CausalBert shows the advantage of handling a mixed-language context. For multilingual speakers, the conversation may involve multiple languages. Therefore, we experiment on M-CausalBert with two settings: 1) many-to-one, in which users converse with the model in 6 languages, and the model generate responses in English, 2) one-to-many, in which users converse with the model using English, and the model generates responses in 6 languages using language embedding and corresponding persona sentences. Table TABREF42 and table TABREF43 illustrate the generation examples under these settings (more examples reported in Appendix C.1). Most of the time, M-CausalBert can understand the mixed-language context, and decode coherent response in different languages. Understanding the mixed-language dialogue context is a desirable skill for end-to-end chit-chat systems, and a systematic study of this research question is needed in future.\nThe current state-of-the-art cross-lingual generation approach XNLG BIBREF4 shows inferior performance on multi-turn dialogue tasks, and generates repetitive responses. Although cross-lingual dialogue generation is challenging, it reduces the human effort for data annotation in different languages. Therefore, the cross-language transfer is an important direction to investigate.\nIn this paper, we studied both cross-lingual and multilingual approaches in end-to-end personalized dialogue modeling. We presented the XPersona dataset, a multilingual extension of Persona-Chat, for evaluating the multilingual personalized chatbots. We further provided both cross-lingual and multilingual baselines and compared them with the monolingual approach and two-stage translation approach. Extensive automatic evaluation and human evaluation were conducted to examine the models' performance. The experimental results showed that multilingual trained models, with a single model across multiple languages, can outperform the two-stage translation approach and is on par with monolingual models. On the other hand, the current state-of-the-art cross-lingual approach XNLG achieved lower performance than other baselines. In future work, we plan to research a more advanced cross-lingual generation approach and construct a mixed-language conversational benchmark for evaluating multilingual systems.\nIn this section, we show the instructions for French annotation:\nThere are two existing columns of conversations: the first column (en) is the original conversations in English, the second column (fr) is the conversations translated by an automatic system (e.g., Google Translate).\nYou should copy the conversation from the second column (the translated conversations) into the third column (named fr_annotation). In that column, you should then revise the incorrect or inappropriate translations.\nThe goal of the revision is to make the conversations more coherent and fluent in the target language (French). Hence you can customize dialogues and persona sentences to make them fluent and coherent in the target language, including by deviating from the original translation. However, you should retain persona and conversation consistency.\nWe report our iterative revised training set statistics in Table TABREF53.\nFigure FIGREF55 and FIGREF56 illustrates the details of the multilingual causal decoder and the multilingual encoder-decoder models.\nAs illustrated in Figure FIGREF54, the annotator is provided with two full dialogues made by a self-chat model or human-dialogues. Then the annotators are asked the following questions:\nWho would you talk to for a long conversation?\nIf you had to say one of these speakers is interesting and one is boring, who would you say is more interesting?\nWhich speaker sounds more human?\nWe report more the mixed-language samples generated by M-CausalBert in Table TABREF61 and TABREF62.\nWe randomly sample one self-chat dialogue examples for each model in each language and report them in figure 5-32.\nin CausalBert,M-CausalBert,PolyEncoder,M-Bert2Bert\nin CausalBert,M-CausalBert,PolyEncoder,M-Bert2Bert\nin CausalBert,M-CausalBert,PolyEncoder,M-Bert2Bert\nin CausalBert,M-CausalBert,PolyEncoder,M-Bert2Bert\nin CausalBert,M-CausalBert,PolyEncoder,M-Bert2Bert\nin CausalBert,M-CausalBert,PolyEncoder,M-Bert2Bert\nin CausalBert,M-CausalBert,PolyEncoder,M-Bert2Bert", "question": "What kind of evaluations do use to evaluate dialogue?", "expected_output": "They use automatic evaluation using perplexity and BLEU scores with reference to the human-annotated responses and human evaluation on interestingness, engagingness, and humanness..

Interested readers may refer to BIBREF11 for a general overview. In this paper, we focus on the latter, for which, in recent years, several tasks and datasets have been proposed to ground the conversation on knowledge BIBREF12, BIBREF13, BIBREF14, BIBREF15, BIBREF16, BIBREF17, BIBREF18 such as Wiki-Articles, Reddit-Post, and CNN-Article. In this work, we focus on personalized dialogue agents where the dialogues are grounded on persona information.\nBIBREF19 was the first to introduce a persona-grounded dialogue dataset for improving response consistency. Later on, BIBREF0 and BIBREF1 introduced Persona-chat, a multi-turn conversational dataset, where two speakers are paired, and a persona description (4\u20135 sentences) is randomly assigned to each of them. By conditioning the response generation on the persona descriptions, a chit-chat model is able to produce a more persona-consistent dialogue BIBREF0. Several works have improved on the initial baselines with various methodologies BIBREF20, BIBREF21, BIBREF22, BIBREF23, BIBREF24, BIBREF25, especially using large pre-trained models BIBREF26, BIBREF27.\nExtensive approaches have been introduced to construct multilingual systems, for example, multilingual semantic role labeling BIBREF28, BIBREF29, multilingual machine translation BIBREF30, multilingual automatic speech recognition BIBREF31, BIBREF32, BIBREF33, BIBREF34, and named entity recognition BIBREF35, BIBREF36. Multilingual deep contextualized model such as Multilingual BERT (M-BERT) BIBREF5 have been commonly used to represent multiple languages and elevate the performance in many NLP applications, such as classification tasks BIBREF37, textual entailment, named entity recognition BIBREF38, and natural language understanding BIBREF39. Multilingual datasets have also been created for a number of NLP tasks, such as named entity recognition or linking BIBREF40, BIBREF41, BIBREF42, BIBREF43, question answering BIBREF44, BIBREF45, semantic role labeling BIBREF46, part-of-speech tagging BIBREF47, dialogue state tracking BIBREF48, and natural language understanding BIBREF49. However, none of these datasets include the multilingual chit-chat task.\nCross-lingual adaptation learns the inter-connections among languages and circumvents the requirement of extensive training data in target languages BIBREF50, BIBREF51, BIBREF52. Cross-lingual transfer learning methods have been applied to multiple NLP tasks, such as named entity recognition BIBREF53, BIBREF54, natural language understanding BIBREF39, dialogue state tracking BIBREF55, part-of-speech tagging BIBREF50, BIBREF51, BIBREF56, and dependency parsing BIBREF57, BIBREF58. Meanwhile, BIBREF59 and BIBREF60 proposed pre-trained cross-lingual language models to align multiple language representations, achieving state-of-the-art results in many cross-lingual classification tasks. The aforementioned tasks focused on classification and sequence labeling, while instead, BIBREF4 proposed to pre-train both the encoder and decoder of a sequence-to-sequence model (XNLG) to conduct cross-lingual generation tasks, namely, question generation and abstractive summarization. The latter is the closest to our task since it focuses on language generation; however cross-lingual dialogue generation has not yet been explored.\nThe proposed XPersona dataset is an extension of the persona-chat dataset BIBREF0, BIBREF1. Specifically, we extend the ConvAI2 BIBREF1 to six languages: Chinese, French, Indonesian, Italian, Korean, and Japanese. Since the test set of ConvAI2 is hidden, we split the original validation set into a new validation set and test sets. Then, we firstly automatically translate the training, validation, and test set using APIs (PapaGo for Korean, Google Translate for other languages). For each language, we hired native speaker annotators with a fluent level of English and asked them to revise the machine-translated dialogues and persona sentences in the validation set and test set according to original English dialogues. The main goal of human annotation is to ensure the resulting conversations are coherent and fluent despite the cultural differences in target languages. Therefore, annotators are not restricted to only translate the English dialogues, and they are allowed to modify the original dialogues to improve the dialogue coherence in the corresponding language while retaining the persona information. The full annotation instructions are reported in Appendix A.\nCompared to collecting new persona sentences and dialogues in each language, human-annotating the dialogues by leveraging translation APIs has multiple advantages. First, it increases the data distribution similarity across languages BIBREF3, which can better examine the system's cross-lingual transferability. Second, revising the machine-translated dialogues based on the original English dialogue improves the data construction efficiency. Third, it leverages the well-constructed English persona conversations as a reference to ensure the dialogue quality without the need for training a new pool of workers to generate new samples BIBREF3.\nOn the other hand, human-translating the entire training-set ($\\sim $130K utterances) in six languages is expensive. Therefore, we propose an iterative method to improve the quality of the automatically translated training set. We firstly sample 200 dialogues from the training set ($\\sim $2600 utterances) in each language, and we assign human annotators to list all frequent translation mistakes in the given dialogues. For example, daily colloquial English expressions such as \u201ccool\", \u201cI see\", and \u201clol\" are usually literally translated. After that, we use a simple string matching to revise the inappropriate translations in the whole training-set and return a revision log, which records all the revised utterances. Then, we assign human annotators to check all the revised utterances and list translation mistakes again. We repeat this process at least twice for each language. Finally, we summarize the statistics of the collected dataset in Table TABREF6.\nLet us define a dialogue $\\mathcal {D}=\\lbrace U_1,S_1,U_2,S_2, \\dots , U_n, S_n\\rbrace $ as an alternating set of utterances from two speakers, where $U$ and $S$ represent the user and the system, respectively. Each speaker has its corresponding persona description that consists of a set of sentences $\\mathcal {P}=\\lbrace P_1,\\dots ,P_m\\rbrace $. Given the system persona sentences $\\mathcal {P}_s$ and dialogue history $\\mathcal {D}_t=\\lbrace U_1,S_1,U_2, \\dots ,S_{t-1}, U_t\\rbrace $, we are interested in predicting the system utterances $S_t$.\nWe explore both encoder-decoder and causal decoder architectures, and we leverage existing pre-trained contextualized multilingual language models as weights initialization. Hence, we firstly define the multilingual embedding layer and then the two multilingual models used in our experiments.\nWe define three embedding matrices: word embedding $E^W\\in \\mathbb {R}^{|V| \\times d}$, positional embedding $E^P\\in \\mathbb {R}^{M \\times d}$, and segmentation embedding $E^S\\in \\mathbb {R}^{|S| \\times d}$, where $|.|$ denotes set cardinality, $d$ is the embedding size, $V$ denotes the vocabulary, $M$ denotes the maximum sequence length, and $S$ denotes the set of segmentation tokens. Segmentation embedding BIBREF26 is used to indicate whether the current token is part of i) Persona sentences, ii) System (Sys.) utterances, iii) User utterances, iv) response in Language $l_{id}$. The language embedding $l_{id}$ is used to inform the model which language to generate. Hence, given a sequence of tokens $X$, the embedding functions $E$ are defined as:\nwhere $\\oplus $ denotes the positional sum, $X_{pos}=\\lbrace 1,\\dots ,|X|\\rbrace $ and $X_{seg}$ is the sequence of segmentation tokens, as in BIBREF26. Figure FIGREF9 shows a visual representation of the embedding process. A more detailed illustration is reported in Appendix B.\nTo model the response generation, we use a Transformer BIBREF61 based encoder-decoder BIBREF10. As illustrated in Figure FIGREF9, we concatenate the system persona $\\mathcal {P}_s$ with the dialogue history $\\mathcal {D}_t$. Then we use the embedding layer $E$ to finally pass it to the encoder. In short, we have:\nwhere $H \\in \\mathbb {R}^{L \\times d_{model}}$ is the hidden representation computed by the encoder, and $L$ denotes the input sequence length. Then, the decoder attends to $H$ and generates the system response $S_t$ token by token. In the decoder, segmentation embedding is the language ID embedding (e.g., we look up the embedding for Italian to decode Italian). Thus:\nAs an alternative to encoder-decoders, the causal-decoders BIBREF62, BIBREF63, BIBREF64 have been used to model conversational responses BIBREF26, BIBREF27 by giving as a prefix the dialogue history. In our model, we concatenate the persona $\\mathcal {P}_s$ and the dialogue history $\\mathcal {D}_t$ as the language model prefix, and autoregressively decode the system response $S_t$ based on language embedding (i.e. $l_{id}$):\nFigure FIGREF9 shows the conceptual differences between the encoder-decoder and casual decoder. Note that in both multilingual models, the dialogue history encoding process is language-agnostic, while decoding language is controlled by the language embedding. Such design allows the model to understand mixed-language dialogue contexts and to responds in the desired language (details in Section SECREF44).\nWe consider two training strategies to learn a multilingual conversational model: multilingual training and cross-lingual training.\njointly learns to perform personalized conversations in multiple languages. We follow a transfer learning approach BIBREF26, BIBREF65 by initializing our models with the weights of the large multilingual pretrained model M-Bert BIBREF37. For the causal decoder, we add the causal mask into self-attention layer to convert M-Bert encoder to decoder. For encoder-decoder model, we randomly initialize the cross encoder-decoder attention BIBREF66. Then, we train the both models on the combined training set in all 7 languages using cross-entropy loss.\ntransfers knowledge from the source language data to the target languages. In this setting, the model is trained on English (source language) conversational samples, and evaluated on the other 6 languages. Following the methodology proposed by BIBREF4, we align the embedded representations of different languages into the same embedding space by applying cross-lingual pre-training to the encoder-decoder model. The pre-training procedure consists of two stages:\npre-training the encoder and the decoder independently utilizing masked language modeling, as in BIBREF59;\njointly pre-training the encoder-decoder by using two objective functions: Cross-Lingual Auto-Encoding (XAE) and Denoising Auto-Encoding (DAE) BIBREF4.\nFor instance, DAE adds perturbations to the input sentence and tries to reconstructs the original sentence using the decoder, whereas, XAE uses parallel translation data as the supervision signal to pre-train both the encoder and decoder. As in the multilingual models, the language IDs are fed into the decoder to control the language of generated sentences. Both pre-training stages require both parallel and non-parallel data in the target language.\nAfter the two stages of pre-training, the model is fine-tuned using just the source language samples (i.e., English) with the same cross-entropy loss as for the multilingual training. However, as suggested in BIBREF4, only the encoder parameters are updated with back-propagation and both the decoder and the word embedding layer remain frozen. This retains the decoders' ability to generate multilingual output while still being able to learn new tasks using only the target language.\nEvaluating open-domain chit-chat models is challenging, especially in multiple languages and at the dialogue-level. Hence, we evaluate our models using both automatic and human evaluation. In both cases, human-annotated dialogues are used, which show the importance of the provided dataset.\nFor each language, we evaluate responses generated by the models using perplexity (ppl.) and BLEU BIBREF67 with reference to the human-annotated responses. Although these automatic measures are not perfect BIBREF68, they help to roughly estimate the performance of different models under the same test set. More recently, BIBREF69 has shown the correlation between perplexity and human judgment in open-domain chit-chat models.\nAsking humans to evaluate the quality of a dialogue model is challenging, especially when multiple models have to be compared. The likert score (a.k.a. 1 to 5 scoring) has been widely used to evaluate the interactive experience with conversational models BIBREF70, BIBREF65, BIBREF0, BIBREF1. In such evaluation, a human interacts with the systems for several turns, and then they assign a score from 1 to 5 based on three questions BIBREF0 about fluency, engagingness, and consistency. This evaluation is both expensive to conduct and requires many samples to achieve statistically significant results BIBREF6. To cope with these issues, BIBREF6 proposed ACUTE-EVAL, an A/B test evaluation for dialogue systems. The authors proposed two modes: human-model chats and self-chat BIBREF71, BIBREF72. In this work, we opt for the latter since it is cheaper to conduct and achieves similar results BIBREF6 to the former. Another advantage of using this method is the ability to evaluate multi-turn conversations instead of single-turn responses.\nFollowing ACUTE-EVAL, the annotator is provided with two full dialogues made by self-chat or human-dialogue. The annotator is asked to choose which of the two dialogues is better in terms of engagingness, interestingness, and humanness. For each comparison, we sample 60\u2013100 conversations from both models. In Appendix C, we report the exact questions and instructions given to the annotators, and the user interface used in the evaluation. We hired native speakers annotators for all six considered languages. The annotators were different from the dataset collection annotators to avoid any possible bias.\nWe use the \"BERT-Base, Multilingual Cased\" checkpoint, and we denote the multilingual encoder-decoder model as M-Bert2Bert ($\\sim $220M parameters) and causal decoder model as M-CausalBert ($\\sim $110M parameters). We fine-tune both models in the combined training set (English in Persona-chat BIBREF0, six languages in Xpersona) for five epochs with AdamW optimizer and a learning rate of $6.25e$-5.\nTo verify whether the multilingual agent will under-perform the monolingual agent in the monolingual conversational task, we build a monolingual encoder-decoder model and causal decoder model for each language. For a fair comparison, we initialize the monolingual models with a pre-trained monolingual BERT BIBREF5, BIBREF73, BIBREF74. We denote the monolingual encoder-decoder model as Bert2Bert ($\\sim $220M parameters) and causal decoder model as CausalBert ($\\sim $110M parameters). Then we fine-tune each model in each language independently for the same number of epoch and optimizer as the multilingual model.\nAnother strong baseline we compare with is Poly-encoder BIBREF75, a large-scale pre-trained retrieval model that has shown state-of-the-art performance in the English Persona-chat dataset BIBREF6. We adapt this model to the other languages by using the Google Translate API to translate target languages (e.g., Chinese) query to English as the input to the model, then translate the English response back to the target language. Thus, the response generation flow is: target query $\\rightarrow $ English query $\\rightarrow $ English response $\\rightarrow $ target response. We denote this model as Poly.\nIn the first pre-training stage, we use the pre-trained weights from XLMR-base BIBREF60. Then, we follow the second pre-training stage of XNLG BIBREF4 for pre-training Italian, Japanese, Korean, Indonesia cross-lingual transferable models. For Chinese and French, we directly apply the pre-trained XNLG BIBREF4 weights. Then, the pre-trained models are fine-tune on English PersonaChat training set and early stop based on the perplexity on target language validation set.\nTable TABREF20 compares monolingual, multilingual, and cross-lingual models in terms of BLEU and perplexity in the human-translated test set. On both evaluation matrices, the causal decoder models outperform the encoder-decoder models. We observe that the encoder-decoder model tends to overlook dialogue context and generate digressive responses. (Generated samples are available in Appendix D) We hypothesize that this is because the one-to-many problem BIBREF76 in open-domain conversation weakens the relation between encoder and decoder; thus the well pre-trained decoder (Bert) easily converges to a locally-optimal, and learns to ignore the dialogue context from the encoder and generate the response in an unconditional language model way. We leave the investigation of this problem to future work. On the other hand, M-CausalBert achieves a comparable or slightly better performance compared to CausalBert, which suggests that M-CausalBert leverages the data from other languages. As expected, we observe a significant gap between the cross-lingual model and other models, which indicates that cross-lingual zero-shot conversation modeling is very challenging.\nTable TABREF28 shows the human evaluation result of comparing M-CausalBert (Multi) against the human, translation-based Poly-encoder (Poly), and monolingual CausalBert (Mono). The results illustrate that Multi outperforms Mono in English and Chinese, and is on par with Mono in other languages. On the other hand, Poly shows a strong performance in English as it was pre-trained with a large-scale English conversation corpus. In contrast, the performance of Poly drops in other languages, which indicates that the imperfect translation affects translation-based systems.\nWe randomly sample 7 self-chat dialogues for each baseline model in the seven languages and report them in Appendix D., And we summarize the generation of each model as follows:\nPoly-encoder, pretrained on 174 million Reddit data, can accurately retrieve coherent and diverse responses in English. However, in the other six languages, some of the retrieved responses are digressive due to translation error.\nWe observe that both the monolingual and multilingual models can generate fluent responses. Compared to Bert2Bert and M-Bert2Bert, CausalBert and M-CausalBert can generate more on-topic responses but sometimes repeat through turns. CausalBert and M-CausalBert are on par with each other in monolingual conversational tasks, while M-CausalBert shows the advantage of handling a mixed-language context. For multilingual speakers, the conversation may involve multiple languages. Therefore, we experiment on M-CausalBert with two settings: 1) many-to-one, in which users converse with the model in 6 languages, and the model generate responses in English, 2) one-to-many, in which users converse with the model using English, and the model generates responses in 6 languages using language embedding and corresponding persona sentences. Table TABREF42 and table TABREF43 illustrate the generation examples under these settings (more examples reported in Appendix C.1). Most of the time, M-CausalBert can understand the mixed-language context, and decode coherent response in different languages. Understanding the mixed-language dialogue context is a desirable skill for end-to-end chit-chat systems, and a systematic study of this research question is needed in future.\nThe current state-of-the-art cross-lingual generation approach XNLG BIBREF4 shows inferior performance on multi-turn dialogue tasks, and generates repetitive responses. Although cross-lingual dialogue generation is challenging, it reduces the human effort for data annotation in different languages. Therefore, the cross-language transfer is an important direction to investigate.\nIn this paper, we studied both cross-lingual and multilingual approaches in end-to-end personalized dialogue modeling. We presented the XPersona dataset, a multilingual extension of Persona-Chat, for evaluating the multilingual personalized chatbots. We further provided both cross-lingual and multilingual baselines and compared them with the monolingual approach and two-stage translation approach. Extensive automatic evaluation and human evaluation were conducted to examine the models' performance. The experimental results showed that multilingual trained models, with a single model across multiple languages, can outperform the two-stage translation approach and is on par with monolingual models. On the other hand, the current state-of-the-art cross-lingual approach XNLG achieved lower performance than other baselines. In future work, we plan to research a more advanced cross-lingual generation approach and construct a mixed-language conversational benchmark for evaluating multilingual systems.\nIn this section, we show the instructions for French annotation:\nThere are two existing columns of conversations: the first column (en) is the original conversations in English, the second column (fr) is the conversations translated by an automatic system (e.g., Google Translate).\nYou should copy the conversation from the second column (the translated conversations) into the third column (named fr_annotation). In that column, you should then revise the incorrect or inappropriate translations.\nThe goal of the revision is to make the conversations more coherent and fluent in the target language (French). Hence you can customize dialogues and persona sentences to make them fluent and coherent in the target language, including by deviating from the original translation. However, you should retain persona and conversation consistency.\nWe report our iterative revised training set statistics in Table TABREF53.\nFigure FIGREF55 and FIGREF56 illustrates the details of the multilingual causal decoder and the multilingual encoder-decoder models.\nAs illustrated in Figure FIGREF54, the annotator is provided with two full dialogues made by a self-chat model or human-dialogues. Then the annotators are asked the following questions:\nWho would you talk to for a long conversation?\nIf you had to say one of these speakers is interesting and one is boring, who would you say is more interesting?\nWhich speaker sounds more human?\nWe report more the mixed-language samples generated by M-CausalBert in Table TABREF61 and TABREF62.\nWe randomly sample one self-chat dialogue examples for each model in each language and report them in figure 5-32.\nin CausalBert,M-CausalBert,PolyEncoder,M-Bert2Bert\nin CausalBert,M-CausalBert,PolyEncoder,M-Bert2Bert\nin CausalBert,M-CausalBert,PolyEncoder,M-Bert2Bert\nin CausalBert,M-CausalBert,PolyEncoder,M-Bert2Bert\nin CausalBert,M-CausalBert,PolyEncoder,M-Bert2Bert\nin CausalBert,M-CausalBert,PolyEncoder,M-Bert2Bert\nin CausalBert,M-CausalBert,PolyEncoder,M-Bert2Bert", "question": "By how much do their cross-lingual models lag behind other models?", "expected_output": "significant gap between the cross-lingual model and other models.

{"id": "2003.07568", "prompt": "Personalized dialogue agents have been shown efficient in conducting human-like conversation. This progress has been catalyzed thanks to existing conversational dataset such as Persona-chat BIBREF0, BIBREF1. However, the training data are provided in a single language (e.g., English), and thus the resulting systems can perform conversations only in the training language. For wide, commercial dialogue systems are required to handle a large number of languages since the smart home devices market is increasingly international BIBREF2. Therefore, creating multilingual conversational benchmarks is essential, yet challenging since it is costly to perform human annotation of data in all languages.\nA possible solution is to use translation systems before and after the model inference, a two-step translation from any language to English and from English to any language. This comes with three major problems: 1) amplification of translation errors since the current dialogue systems are far from perfect, especially with noisy input; 2) the three-stage pipeline system is significantly slower in terms of inference speed; and 3) high translation costs since the current state-of-the-art models, especially in low resources languages, are only available using costly APIs.\nIn this paper, we analyze two possible workarounds to alleviate the aforementioned challenges. The first is to build a cross-lingual transferable system by aligning cross-lingual representations, as in BIBREF3, in which the system is trained on one language and zero-shot to another language. The second is to learn a multilingual system directly from noisy multilingual data (e.g., translated data), thus getting rid of the translation system dependence at inference time.\nTo evaluate the aforementioned systems, we propose a dataset called Multilingual Persona-Chat, or XPersona, by extending the Persona-Chat corpora BIBREF1 to six languages: Chinese, French, Indonesian, Italian, Korean, and Japanese. In XPersona, the training sets are automatically translated using translation APIs with several human-in-the-loop passes of mistake correction. In contrast, the validation and test sets are annotated by human experts to facilitate both automatic and human evaluations in multiple languages.\nFurthermore, we propose competitive baselines in two training settings, namely, cross-lingual and multilingual, and compare them with translation pipeline models. Our baselines leverage pre-trained cross-lingual BIBREF4 and multilingual BIBREF5 models.\nAn extensive automatic and human evaluation BIBREF6 of our models shows that a multilingual system is able to outperform strong translation-based models and on par with or even improve the monolingual model. The cross-lingual performance is still lower than other models, which indicates that cross-lingual conversation modeling is very challenging. The main contribution of this paper are summarized as follows:\nWe present the first multilingual non-goal-oriented dialogue benchmark for evaluating multilingual generative chatbots.\nWe provide both cross-lingual and multilingual baselines and discuss their limitations to inspire future research.\nWe show the potential of multilingual systems to understand the mixed language dialogue context and generate coherent responses.\nare categorized as goal-oriented BIBREF7, BIBREF8 and chit-chat BIBREF9, BIBREF10.

In the decoder, segmentation embedding is the language ID embedding (e.g., we look up the embedding for Italian to decode Italian). Thus:\nAs an alternative to encoder-decoders, the causal-decoders BIBREF62, BIBREF63, BIBREF64 have been used to model conversational responses BIBREF26, BIBREF27 by giving as a prefix the dialogue history. In our model, we concatenate the persona $\\mathcal {P}_s$ and the dialogue history $\\mathcal {D}_t$ as the language model prefix, and autoregressively decode the system response $S_t$ based on language embedding (i.e. $l_{id}$):\nFigure FIGREF9 shows the conceptual differences between the encoder-decoder and casual decoder. Note that in both multilingual models, the dialogue history encoding process is language-agnostic, while decoding language is controlled by the language embedding. Such design allows the model to understand mixed-language dialogue contexts and to responds in the desired language (details in Section SECREF44).\nWe consider two training strategies to learn a multilingual conversational model: multilingual training and cross-lingual training.\njointly learns to perform personalized conversations in multiple languages. We follow a transfer learning approach BIBREF26, BIBREF65 by initializing our models with the weights of the large multilingual pretrained model M-Bert BIBREF37. For the causal decoder, we add the causal mask into self-attention layer to convert M-Bert encoder to decoder. For encoder-decoder model, we randomly initialize the cross encoder-decoder attention BIBREF66. Then, we train the both models on the combined training set in all 7 languages using cross-entropy loss.\ntransfers knowledge from the source language data to the target languages. In this setting, the model is trained on English (source language) conversational samples, and evaluated on the other 6 languages. Following the methodology proposed by BIBREF4, we align the embedded representations of different languages into the same embedding space by applying cross-lingual pre-training to the encoder-decoder model. The pre-training procedure consists of two stages:\npre-training the encoder and the decoder independently utilizing masked language modeling, as in BIBREF59;\njointly pre-training the encoder-decoder by using two objective functions: Cross-Lingual Auto-Encoding (XAE) and Denoising Auto-Encoding (DAE) BIBREF4.\nFor instance, DAE adds perturbations to the input sentence and tries to reconstructs the original sentence using the decoder, whereas, XAE uses parallel translation data as the supervision signal to pre-train both the encoder and decoder. As in the multilingual models, the language IDs are fed into the decoder to control the language of generated sentences. Both pre-training stages require both parallel and non-parallel data in the target language.\nAfter the two stages of pre-training, the model is fine-tuned using just the source language samples (i.e., English) with the same cross-entropy loss as for the multilingual training. However, as suggested in BIBREF4, only the encoder parameters are updated with back-propagation and both the decoder and the word embedding layer remain frozen. This retains the decoders' ability to generate multilingual output while still being able to learn new tasks using only the target language.\nEvaluating open-domain chit-chat models is challenging, especially in multiple languages and at the dialogue-level. Hence, we evaluate our models using both automatic and human evaluation. In both cases, human-annotated dialogues are used, which show the importance of the provided dataset.\nFor each language, we evaluate responses generated by the models using perplexity (ppl.) and BLEU BIBREF67 with reference to the human-annotated responses. Although these automatic measures are not perfect BIBREF68, they help to roughly estimate the performance of different models under the same test set. More recently, BIBREF69 has shown the correlation between perplexity and human judgment in open-domain chit-chat models.\nAsking humans to evaluate the quality of a dialogue model is challenging, especially when multiple models have to be compared. The likert score (a.k.a. 1 to 5 scoring) has been widely used to evaluate the interactive experience with conversational models BIBREF70, BIBREF65, BIBREF0, BIBREF1. In such evaluation, a human interacts with the systems for several turns, and then they assign a score from 1 to 5 based on three questions BIBREF0 about fluency, engagingness, and consistency. This evaluation is both expensive to conduct and requires many samples to achieve statistically significant results BIBREF6. To cope with these issues, BIBREF6 proposed ACUTE-EVAL, an A/B test evaluation for dialogue systems. The authors proposed two modes: human-model chats and self-chat BIBREF71, BIBREF72. In this work, we opt for the latter since it is cheaper to conduct and achieves similar results BIBREF6 to the former. Another advantage of using this method is the ability to evaluate multi-turn conversations instead of single-turn responses.\nFollowing ACUTE-EVAL, the annotator is provided with two full dialogues made by self-chat or human-dialogue. The annotator is asked to choose which of the two dialogues is better in terms of engagingness, interestingness, and humanness. For each comparison, we sample 60\u2013100 conversations from both models. In Appendix C, we report the exact questions and instructions given to the annotators, and the user interface used in the evaluation. We hired native speakers annotators for all six considered languages. The annotators were different from the dataset collection annotators to avoid any possible bias.\nWe use the \"BERT-Base, Multilingual Cased\" checkpoint, and we denote the multilingual encoder-decoder model as M-Bert2Bert ($\\sim $220M parameters) and causal decoder model as M-CausalBert ($\\sim $110M parameters). We fine-tune both models in the combined training set (English in Persona-chat BIBREF0, six languages in Xpersona) for five epochs with AdamW optimizer and a learning rate of $6.25e$-5.\nTo verify whether the multilingual agent will under-perform the monolingual agent in the monolingual conversational task, we build a monolingual encoder-decoder model and causal decoder model for each language. For a fair comparison, we initialize the monolingual models with a pre-trained monolingual BERT BIBREF5, BIBREF73, BIBREF74. We denote the monolingual encoder-decoder model as Bert2Bert ($\\sim $220M parameters) and causal decoder model as CausalBert ($\\sim $110M parameters). Then we fine-tune each model in each language independently for the same number of epoch and optimizer as the multilingual model.\nAnother strong baseline we compare with is Poly-encoder BIBREF75, a large-scale pre-trained retrieval model that has shown state-of-the-art performance in the English Persona-chat dataset BIBREF6. We adapt this model to the other languages by using the Google Translate API to translate target languages (e.g., Chinese) query to English as the input to the model, then translate the English response back to the target language. Thus, the response generation flow is: target query $\\rightarrow $ English query $\\rightarrow $ English response $\\rightarrow $ target response. We denote this model as Poly.\nIn the first pre-training stage, we use the pre-trained weights from XLMR-base BIBREF60. Then, we follow the second pre-training stage of XNLG BIBREF4 for pre-training Italian, Japanese, Korean, Indonesia cross-lingual transferable models. For Chinese and French, we directly apply the pre-trained XNLG BIBREF4 weights. Then, the pre-trained models are fine-tune on English PersonaChat training set and early stop based on the perplexity on target language validation set.\nTable TABREF20 compares monolingual, multilingual, and cross-lingual models in terms of BLEU and perplexity in the human-translated test set. On both evaluation matrices, the causal decoder models outperform the encoder-decoder models. We observe that the encoder-decoder model tends to overlook dialogue context and generate digressive responses. (Generated samples are available in Appendix D) We hypothesize that this is because the one-to-many problem BIBREF76 in open-domain conversation weakens the relation between encoder and decoder; thus the well pre-trained decoder (Bert) easily converges to a locally-optimal, and learns to ignore the dialogue context from the encoder and generate the response in an unconditional language model way. We leave the investigation of this problem to future work. On the other hand, M-CausalBert achieves a comparable or slightly better performance compared to CausalBert, which suggests that M-CausalBert leverages the data from other languages. As expected, we observe a significant gap between the cross-lingual model and other models, which indicates that cross-lingual zero-shot conversation modeling is very challenging.\nTable TABREF28 shows the human evaluation result of comparing M-CausalBert (Multi) against the human, translation-based Poly-encoder (Poly), and monolingual CausalBert (Mono). The results illustrate that Multi outperforms Mono in English and Chinese, and is on par with Mono in other languages. On the other hand, Poly shows a strong performance in English as it was pre-trained with a large-scale English conversation corpus. In contrast, the performance of Poly drops in other languages, which indicates that the imperfect translation affects translation-based systems.\nWe randomly sample 7 self-chat dialogues for each baseline model in the seven languages and report them in Appendix D., And we summarize the generation of each model as follows:\nPoly-encoder, pretrained on 174 million Reddit data, can accurately retrieve coherent and diverse responses in English. However, in the other six languages, some of the retrieved responses are digressive due to translation error.\nWe observe that both the monolingual and multilingual models can generate fluent responses. Compared to Bert2Bert and M-Bert2Bert, CausalBert and M-CausalBert can generate more on-topic responses but sometimes repeat through turns. CausalBert and M-CausalBert are on par with each other in monolingual conversational tasks, while M-CausalBert shows the advantage of handling a mixed-language context. For multilingual speakers, the conversation may involve multiple languages. Therefore, we experiment on M-CausalBert with two settings: 1) many-to-one, in which users converse with the model in 6 languages, and the model generate responses in English, 2) one-to-many, in which users converse with the model using English, and the model generates responses in 6 languages using language embedding and corresponding persona sentences. Table TABREF42 and table TABREF43 illustrate the generation examples under these settings (more examples reported in Appendix C.1). Most of the time, M-CausalBert can understand the mixed-language context, and decode coherent response in different languages. Understanding the mixed-language dialogue context is a desirable skill for end-to-end chit-chat systems, and a systematic study of this research question is needed in future.\nThe current state-of-the-art cross-lingual generation approach XNLG BIBREF4 shows inferior performance on multi-turn dialogue tasks, and generates repetitive responses. Although cross-lingual dialogue generation is challenging, it reduces the human effort for data annotation in different languages. Therefore, the cross-language transfer is an important direction to investigate.\nIn this paper, we studied both cross-lingual and multilingual approaches in end-to-end personalized dialogue modeling. We presented the XPersona dataset, a multilingual extension of Persona-Chat, for evaluating the multilingual personalized chatbots. We further provided both cross-lingual and multilingual baselines and compared them with the monolingual approach and two-stage translation approach. Extensive automatic evaluation and human evaluation were conducted to examine the models' performance. The experimental results showed that multilingual trained models, with a single model across multiple languages, can outperform the two-stage translation approach and is on par with monolingual models. On the other hand, the current state-of-the-art cross-lingual approach XNLG achieved lower performance than other baselines. In future work, we plan to research a more advanced cross-lingual generation approach and construct a mixed-language conversational benchmark for evaluating multilingual systems.\nIn this section, we show the instructions for French annotation:\nThere are two existing columns of conversations: the first column (en) is the original conversations in English, the second column (fr) is the conversations translated by an automatic system (e.g., Google Translate).\nYou should copy the conversation from the second column (the translated conversations) into the third column (named fr_annotation). In that column, you should then revise the incorrect or inappropriate translations.\nThe goal of the revision is to make the conversations more coherent and fluent in the target language (French). Hence you can customize dialogues and persona sentences to make them fluent and coherent in the target language, including by deviating from the original translation. However, you should retain persona and conversation consistency.\nWe report our iterative revised training set statistics in Table TABREF53.\nFigure FIGREF55 and FIGREF56 illustrates the details of the multilingual causal decoder and the multilingual encoder-decoder models.\nAs illustrated in Figure FIGREF54, the annotator is provided with two full dialogues made by a self-chat model or human-dialogues. Then the annotators are asked the following questions:\nWho would you talk to for a long conversation?\nIf you had to say one of these speakers is interesting and one is boring, who would you say is more interesting?\nWhich speaker sounds more human?\nWe report more the mixed-language samples generated by M-CausalBert in Table TABREF61 and TABREF62.\nWe randomly sample one self-chat dialogue examples for each model in each language and report them in figure 5-32.\nin CausalBert,M-CausalBert,PolyEncoder,M-Bert2Bert\nin CausalBert,M-CausalBert,PolyEncoder,M-Bert2Bert\nin CausalBert,M-CausalBert,PolyEncoder,M-Bert2Bert\nin CausalBert,M-CausalBert,PolyEncoder,M-Bert2Bert\nin CausalBert,M-CausalBert,PolyEncoder,M-Bert2Bert\nin CausalBert,M-CausalBert,PolyEncoder,M-Bert2Bert\nin CausalBert,M-CausalBert,PolyEncoder,M-Bert2Bert", "question": "Which translation pipelines do they use to compare against?", "expected_output": "Translate source sentence to English with Google Translate API and then translate the result to the target language with Poly-encoder..

{"id": "2003.07568", "prompt": "Personalized dialogue agents have been shown efficient in conducting human-like conversation. This progress has been catalyzed thanks to existing conversational dataset such as Persona-chat BIBREF0, BIBREF1. However, the training data are provided in a single language (e.g., English), and thus the resulting systems can perform conversations only in the training language. For wide, commercial dialogue systems are required to handle a large number of languages since the smart home devices market is increasingly international BIBREF2. Therefore, creating multilingual conversational benchmarks is essential, yet challenging since it is costly to perform human annotation of data in all languages.\nA possible solution is to use translation systems before and after the model inference, a two-step translation from any language to English and from English to any language. This comes with three major problems: 1) amplification of translation errors since the current dialogue systems are far from perfect, especially with noisy input; 2) the three-stage pipeline system is significantly slower in terms of inference speed; and 3) high translation costs since the current state-of-the-art models, especially in low resources languages, are only available using costly APIs.\nIn this paper, we analyze two possible workarounds to alleviate the aforementioned challenges. The first is to build a cross-lingual transferable system by aligning cross-lingual representations, as in BIBREF3, in which the system is trained on one language and zero-shot to another language. The second is to learn a multilingual system directly from noisy multilingual data (e.g., translated data), thus getting rid of the translation system dependence at inference time.\nTo evaluate the aforementioned systems, we propose a dataset called Multilingual Persona-Chat, or XPersona, by extending the Persona-Chat corpora BIBREF1 to six languages: Chinese, French, Indonesian, Italian, Korean, and Japanese. In XPersona, the training sets are automatically translated using translation APIs with several human-in-the-loop passes of mistake correction. In contrast, the validation and test sets are annotated by human experts to facilitate both automatic and human evaluations in multiple languages.\nFurthermore, we propose competitive baselines in two training settings, namely, cross-lingual and multilingual, and compare them with translation pipeline models. Our baselines leverage pre-trained cross-lingual BIBREF4 and multilingual BIBREF5 models.\nAn extensive automatic and human evaluation BIBREF6 of our models shows that a multilingual system is able to outperform strong translation-based models and on par with or even improve the monolingual model. The cross-lingual performance is still lower than other models, which indicates that cross-lingual conversation modeling is very challenging. The main contribution of this paper are summarized as follows:\nWe present the first multilingual non-goal-oriented dialogue benchmark for evaluating multilingual generative chatbots.\nWe provide both cross-lingual and multilingual baselines and discuss their limitations to inspire future research.\nWe show the potential of multilingual systems to understand the mixed language dialogue context and generate coherent responses.\nare categorized as goal-oriented BIBREF7, BIBREF8 and chit-chat BIBREF9, BIBREF10. Interested readers may refer to BIBREF11 for a general overview. In this paper, we focus on the latter, for which, in recent years, several tasks and datasets have been proposed to ground the conversation on knowledge BIBREF12, BIBREF13, BIBREF14, BIBREF15, BIBREF16, BIBREF17, BIBREF18 such as Wiki-Articles, Reddit-Post, and CNN-Article. In this work, we focus on personalized dialogue agents where the dialogues are grounded on persona information.\nBIBREF19 was the first to introduce a persona-grounded dialogue dataset for improving response consistency. Later on, BIBREF0 and BIBREF1 introduced Persona-chat, a multi-turn conversational dataset, where two speakers are paired, and a persona description (4\u20135 sentences) is randomly assigned to each of them. By conditioning the response generation on the persona descriptions, a chit-chat model is able to produce a more persona-consistent dialogue BIBREF0. Several works have improved on the initial baselines with various methodologies BIBREF20, BIBREF21, BIBREF22, BIBREF23, BIBREF24, BIBREF25, especially using large pre-trained models BIBREF26, BIBREF27.\nExtensive approaches have been introduced to construct multilingual systems, for example, multilingual semantic role labeling BIBREF28, BIBREF29, multilingual machine translation BIBREF30, multilingual automatic speech recognition BIBREF31, BIBREF32, BIBREF33, BIBREF34, and named entity recognition BIBREF35, BIBREF36. Multilingual deep contextualized model such as Multilingual BERT (M-BERT) BIBREF5 have been commonly used to represent multiple languages and elevate the performance in many NLP applications, such as classification tasks BIBREF37, textual entailment, named entity recognition BIBREF38, and natural language understanding BIBREF39. Multilingual datasets have also been created for a number of NLP tasks, such as named entity recognition or linking BIBREF40, BIBREF41, BIBREF42, BIBREF43, question answering BIBREF44, BIBREF45, semantic role labeling BIBREF46, part-of-speech tagging BIBREF47, dialogue state tracking BIBREF48, and natural language understanding BIBREF49. However, none of these datasets include the multilingual chit-chat task.\nCross-lingual adaptation learns the inter-connections among languages and circumvents the requirement of extensive training data in target languages BIBREF50, BIBREF51, BIBREF52. Cross-lingual transfer learning methods have been applied to multiple NLP tasks, such as named entity recognition BIBREF53, BIBREF54, natural language understanding BIBREF39, dialogue state tracking BIBREF55, part-of-speech tagging BIBREF50, BIBREF51, BIBREF56, and dependency parsing BIBREF57, BIBREF58. Meanwhile, BIBREF59 and BIBREF60 proposed pre-trained cross-lingual language models to align multiple language representations, achieving state-of-the-art results in many cross-lingual classification tasks. The aforementioned tasks focused on classification and sequence labeling, while instead, BIBREF4 proposed to pre-train both the encoder and decoder of a sequence-to-sequence model (XNLG) to conduct cross-lingual generation tasks, namely, question generation and abstractive summarization. The latter is the closest to our task since it focuses on language generation; however cross-lingual dialogue generation has not yet been explored.\nThe proposed XPersona dataset is an extension of the persona-chat dataset BIBREF0, BIBREF1. Specifically, we extend the ConvAI2 BIBREF1 to six languages: Chinese, French, Indonesian, Italian, Korean, and Japanese. Since the test set of ConvAI2 is hidden, we split the original validation set into a new validation set and test sets. Then, we firstly automatically translate the training, validation, and test set using APIs (PapaGo for Korean, Google Translate for other languages). For each language, we hired native speaker annotators with a fluent level of English and asked them to revise the machine-translated dialogues and persona sentences in the validation set and test set according to original English dialogues. The main goal of human annotation is to ensure the resulting conversations are coherent and fluent despite the cultural differences in target languages. Therefore, annotators are not restricted to only translate the English dialogues, and they are allowed to modify the original dialogues to improve the dialogue coherence in the corresponding language while retaining the persona information. The full annotation instructions are reported in Appendix A.\nCompared to collecting new persona sentences and dialogues in each language, human-annotating the dialogues by leveraging translation APIs has multiple advantages. First, it increases the data distribution similarity across languages BIBREF3, which can better examine the system's cross-lingual transferability. Second, revising the machine-translated dialogues based on the original English dialogue improves the data construction efficiency. Third, it leverages the well-constructed English persona conversations as a reference to ensure the dialogue quality without the need for training a new pool of workers to generate new samples BIBREF3.\nOn the other hand, human-translating the entire training-set ($\\sim $130K utterances) in six languages is expensive. Therefore, we propose an iterative method to improve the quality of the automatically translated training set. We firstly sample 200 dialogues from the training set ($\\sim $2600 utterances) in each language, and we assign human annotators to list all frequent translation mistakes in the given dialogues. For example, daily colloquial English expressions such as \u201ccool\", \u201cI see\", and \u201clol\" are usually literally translated. After that, we use a simple string matching to revise the inappropriate translations in the whole training-set and return a revision log, which records all the revised utterances. Then, we assign human annotators to check all the revised utterances and list translation mistakes again. We repeat this process at least twice for each language. Finally, we summarize the statistics of the collected dataset in Table TABREF6.\nLet us define a dialogue $\\mathcal {D}=\\lbrace U_1,S_1,U_2,S_2, \\dots , U_n, S_n\\rbrace $ as an alternating set of utterances from two speakers, where $U$ and $S$ represent the user and the system, respectively. Each speaker has its corresponding persona description that consists of a set of sentences $\\mathcal {P}=\\lbrace P_1,\\dots ,P_m\\rbrace $. Given the system persona sentences $\\mathcal {P}_s$ and dialogue history $\\mathcal {D}_t=\\lbrace U_1,S_1,U_2, \\dots ,S_{t-1}, U_t\\rbrace $, we are interested in predicting the system utterances $S_t$.\nWe explore both encoder-decoder and causal decoder architectures, and we leverage existing pre-trained contextualized multilingual language models as weights initialization. Hence, we firstly define the multilingual embedding layer and then the two multilingual models used in our experiments.\nWe define three embedding matrices: word embedding $E^W\\in \\mathbb {R}^{|V| \\times d}$, positional embedding $E^P\\in \\mathbb {R}^{M \\times d}$, and segmentation embedding $E^S\\in \\mathbb {R}^{|S| \\times d}$, where $|.|$ denotes set cardinality, $d$ is the embedding size, $V$ denotes the vocabulary, $M$ denotes the maximum sequence length, and $S$ denotes the set of segmentation tokens. Segmentation embedding BIBREF26 is used to indicate whether the current token is part of i) Persona sentences, ii) System (Sys.) utterances, iii) User utterances, iv) response in Language $l_{id}$. The language embedding $l_{id}$ is used to inform the model which language to generate. Hence, given a sequence of tokens $X$, the embedding functions $E$ are defined as:\nwhere $\\oplus $ denotes the positional sum, $X_{pos}=\\lbrace 1,\\dots ,|X|\\rbrace $ and $X_{seg}$ is the sequence of segmentation tokens, as in BIBREF26. Figure FIGREF9 shows a visual representation of the embedding process. A more detailed illustration is reported in Appendix B.\nTo model the response generation, we use a Transformer BIBREF61 based encoder-decoder BIBREF10. As illustrated in Figure FIGREF9, we concatenate the system persona $\\mathcal {P}_s$ with the dialogue history $\\mathcal {D}_t$. Then we use the embedding layer $E$ to finally pass it to the encoder. In short, we have:\nwhere $H \\in \\mathbb {R}^{L \\times d_{model}}$ is the hidden representation computed by the encoder, and $L$ denotes the input sequence length. Then, the decoder attends to $H$ and generates the system response $S_t$ token by token. In the decoder, segmentation embedding is the language ID embedding (e.g., we look up the embedding for Italian to decode Italian). Thus:\nAs an alternative to encoder-decoders, the causal-decoders BIBREF62, BIBREF63, BIBREF64 have been used to model conversational responses BIBREF26, BIBREF27 by giving as a prefix the dialogue history. In our model, we concatenate the persona $\\mathcal {P}_s$ and the dialogue history $\\mathcal {D}_t$ as the language model prefix, and autoregressively decode the system response $S_t$ based on language embedding (i.e. $l_{id}$):\nFigure FIGREF9 shows the conceptual differences between the encoder-decoder and casual decoder. Note that in both multilingual models, the dialogue history encoding process is language-agnostic, while decoding language is controlled by the language embedding.

As expected, we observe a significant gap between the cross-lingual model and other models, which indicates that cross-lingual zero-shot conversation modeling is very challenging.\nTable TABREF28 shows the human evaluation result of comparing M-CausalBert (Multi) against the human, translation-based Poly-encoder (Poly), and monolingual CausalBert (Mono). The results illustrate that Multi outperforms Mono in English and Chinese, and is on par with Mono in other languages. On the other hand, Poly shows a strong performance in English as it was pre-trained with a large-scale English conversation corpus. In contrast, the performance of Poly drops in other languages, which indicates that the imperfect translation affects translation-based systems.\nWe randomly sample 7 self-chat dialogues for each baseline model in the seven languages and report them in Appendix D., And we summarize the generation of each model as follows:\nPoly-encoder, pretrained on 174 million Reddit data, can accurately retrieve coherent and diverse responses in English. However, in the other six languages, some of the retrieved responses are digressive due to translation error.\nWe observe that both the monolingual and multilingual models can generate fluent responses. Compared to Bert2Bert and M-Bert2Bert, CausalBert and M-CausalBert can generate more on-topic responses but sometimes repeat through turns. CausalBert and M-CausalBert are on par with each other in monolingual conversational tasks, while M-CausalBert shows the advantage of handling a mixed-language context. For multilingual speakers, the conversation may involve multiple languages. Therefore, we experiment on M-CausalBert with two settings: 1) many-to-one, in which users converse with the model in 6 languages, and the model generate responses in English, 2) one-to-many, in which users converse with the model using English, and the model generates responses in 6 languages using language embedding and corresponding persona sentences. Table TABREF42 and table TABREF43 illustrate the generation examples under these settings (more examples reported in Appendix C.1). Most of the time, M-CausalBert can understand the mixed-language context, and decode coherent response in different languages. Understanding the mixed-language dialogue context is a desirable skill for end-to-end chit-chat systems, and a systematic study of this research question is needed in future.\nThe current state-of-the-art cross-lingual generation approach XNLG BIBREF4 shows inferior performance on multi-turn dialogue tasks, and generates repetitive responses. Although cross-lingual dialogue generation is challenging, it reduces the human effort for data annotation in different languages. Therefore, the cross-language transfer is an important direction to investigate.\nIn this paper, we studied both cross-lingual and multilingual approaches in end-to-end personalized dialogue modeling. We presented the XPersona dataset, a multilingual extension of Persona-Chat, for evaluating the multilingual personalized chatbots. We further provided both cross-lingual and multilingual baselines and compared them with the monolingual approach and two-stage translation approach. Extensive automatic evaluation and human evaluation were conducted to examine the models' performance. The experimental results showed that multilingual trained models, with a single model across multiple languages, can outperform the two-stage translation approach and is on par with monolingual models. On the other hand, the current state-of-the-art cross-lingual approach XNLG achieved lower performance than other baselines. In future work, we plan to research a more advanced cross-lingual generation approach and construct a mixed-language conversational benchmark for evaluating multilingual systems.\nIn this section, we show the instructions for French annotation:\nThere are two existing columns of conversations: the first column (en) is the original conversations in English, the second column (fr) is the conversations translated by an automatic system (e.g., Google Translate).\nYou should copy the conversation from the second column (the translated conversations) into the third column (named fr_annotation). In that column, you should then revise the incorrect or inappropriate translations.\nThe goal of the revision is to make the conversations more coherent and fluent in the target language (French). Hence you can customize dialogues and persona sentences to make them fluent and coherent in the target language, including by deviating from the original translation. However, you should retain persona and conversation consistency.\nWe report our iterative revised training set statistics in Table TABREF53.\nFigure FIGREF55 and FIGREF56 illustrates the details of the multilingual causal decoder and the multilingual encoder-decoder models.\nAs illustrated in Figure FIGREF54, the annotator is provided with two full dialogues made by a self-chat model or human-dialogues. Then the annotators are asked the following questions:\nWho would you talk to for a long conversation?\nIf you had to say one of these speakers is interesting and one is boring, who would you say is more interesting?\nWhich speaker sounds more human?\nWe report more the mixed-language samples generated by M-CausalBert in Table TABREF61 and TABREF62.\nWe randomly sample one self-chat dialogue examples for each model in each language and report them in figure 5-32.\nin CausalBert,M-CausalBert,PolyEncoder,M-Bert2Bert\nin CausalBert,M-CausalBert,PolyEncoder,M-Bert2Bert\nin CausalBert,M-CausalBert,PolyEncoder,M-Bert2Bert\nin CausalBert,M-CausalBert,PolyEncoder,M-Bert2Bert\nin CausalBert,M-CausalBert,PolyEncoder,M-Bert2Bert\nin CausalBert,M-CausalBert,PolyEncoder,M-Bert2Bert\nin CausalBert,M-CausalBert,PolyEncoder,M-Bert2Bert", "question": "Which languages does their newly created dataset contain?", "expected_output": "Chinese.

{"id": "1810.02268", "prompt": "Even though machine translation has improved considerably with the advent of neural machine translation (NMT) BIBREF0 , BIBREF1 , the translation of pronouns remains a major issue. They are notoriously hard to translate since they often require context outside the current sentence.\nAs an example, consider the sentences in Figure FIGREF1 . In both languages, there is a pronoun in the second sentence that refers to the European Central Bank. When the second sentence is translated from English to German, the translation of the pronoun it is ambiguous. This ambiguity can only be resolved with context awareness: if a translation system has access to the previous English sentence, the previous German translation, or both, it can determine the antecedent the pronoun refers to. In this German sentence, the antecedent Europ\u00e4ische Zentralbank dictates the feminine gender of the pronoun sie.\nIt is unfortunate, then, that current NMT systems generally operate on the sentence level BIBREF2 , BIBREF3 , BIBREF4 . Documents are translated sentence-by-sentence for practical reasons, such as line-based processing in a pipeline and reduced computational complexity. Furthermore, improvements of larger-context models over baselines in terms of document-level metrics such as BLEU or RIBES have been moderate, so that their computational overhead does not seem justified, and so that it is hard to develop more effective context-aware architectures and empirically validate them.\nTo address this issue, we present an alternative way of evaluating larger-context models on a test set that allows to specifically measure a model's capability to correctly translate pronouns. The test suite consists of pairs of source and target sentences, in combination with contrastive translation variants (for evaluation by model scoring) and additional linguistic and contextual information (for further analysis). The resource is freely available. Additionally, we evaluate several context-aware models that have recently been proposed in the literature on this test set, and extend existing models with parameter tying.\nThe main contributions of our paper are:\nSection SECREF2 explains how our paper relates to existing work on context-aware models and the evaluation of pronoun translation. Section SECREF3 describes our test suite. The context-aware models we use in our experiments are detailed in Section SECREF4 . We discuss our experiments in Section SECREF5 and the results in Section SECREF6 .\nTwo lines of work are related to our paper: research on context-aware translation (described in Section SECREF8 ) and research on focused evaluation of pronoun translation (described in Section SECREF11 ).\nIf the translation of a pronoun requires context beyond the current sentence (see the example in Figure FIGREF1 ), a natural extension of sentence-level NMT models is to condition the model prediction on this necessary context. In the following, we describe a number of existing approaches to making models \u201caware\u201d of additional context.\nThe simplest possible extension is to translate units larger than sentences. BIBREF5 concatenate each sentence with the sentence that precedes it, for the source side of the corpus or both sides. All of their models are standard sequence-to-sequence models built with recurrent neural networks (RNNs), since the method does not require any architectural change. BIBREF11 use the same concatenation technique with a Transformer architecture BIBREF2 , and experiment with wider context.\nA number of works do propose changes to the NMT architecture. A common technique is to extend a standard encoder-decoder model by additional encoders for the context sentence(s), with a modified attention mechanism BIBREF6 , BIBREF9 , BIBREF8 . One aspect that differs between these works is the architecture of the encoder and attention. While BIBREF6 , BIBREF9 extend an RNN encoder-decoder with a second encoder that the decoder attends to, BIBREF8 extend the Transformer architecture with an encoder that is attended to by the main encoder. BIBREF8 also introduce parameter sharing between the main encoder and the context encoder, but do not empirically demonstrate its importance.\nWhile the number of encoded sentences in the previous work is fixed, BIBREF7 , BIBREF10 explore the integration of variable-size context through a hierarchical architecture, where a first-level RNN reads in words to produce sentence vectors, which are then fed into a second-level RNN to produce a document summary.\nApart from differences in the architectures, related work varies in whether it considers source context, target context, or both (see Table TABREF9 for an overview of language arcs and context types). Some work considers only source context, but for pronoun translation, target-side context is intuitively important for disambiguation, especially if the antecedent itself is ambiguous. In our evaluation, we therefore emphasize models that take into account both source and target context.\nOur experiments are based on models from BIBREF9 , who have released their source code. We extend their models with parameter sharing, which was shown to be beneficial by BIBREF8 . Additionally, we consider a concatenative baseline, similar to BIBREF5 , and Transformer-based models BIBREF8 .\nThis section describes several context-aware NMT models that we use in our experiments. They fall into two major categories: models based on RNNs and models based on the Transformer architecture BIBREF2 . We experiment with additional context on the source side and target side.\nPronouns can serve a variety of functions with complex cross-lingual variation BIBREF12 , and hand-picked, manually annotated test suites have been presented for the evaluation of pronoun translation BIBREF13 , BIBREF14 , BIBREF9 . While suitable for analysis, the small size of the test suites makes it hard to make statistically confident comparisons between systems, and the hand-picked nature of the test suites introduces biases. To overcome these problems, we opted for a fully automatic approach to constructing a large-scale test suite.\nConceptually, our test set is most similar to the \u201ccross-lingual pronoun prediction\u201d task held at DiscoMT and WMT in recent years BIBREF15 , BIBREF16 , BIBREF17 : participants are asked to fill a gap in a target sentence, where gaps correspond to pronouns.\nThe first edition of the task focused on English INLINEFORM0 French, and it was found that local context (such as the verb group) was a strong signal for pronoun prediction. Hence, future editions only provided target-side lemmas instead of fully inflected forms, which makes the task less suitable to evaluate end-to-end neural machine translation systems, although such systems have been trained on the task BIBREF18 .\n BIBREF17 do not report on the proportion of intra-sentential and inter-sentential anaphora in their test set, but the two top-performing systems only made use of intra-sentential information. Our test suite focuses on allowing the comparison of end-to-end context-aware NMT systems, and we thus extract a large number of inter-sentential anaphora, with meta-data allowing for a focus on inter-sentential anaphora with a long distance between the pronoun and its antecedent. Our focus on evaluating end-to-end NMT systems also relieves us from having to provide annotated training sets, and reduces pressure to achieve balance and full coverage of phenomena.\nAn alternative approach to automatically evaluate pronoun translation are reference-based methods that produce a score based on word alignment between source, translation output, and reference translation, and identification of pronouns in them, such as AutoPRF BIBREF19 and APT BIBREF20 . BIBREF21 perform a human meta-evaluation and show substantial disagreement between reference-based metrics and human judges, especially because there often exist valid alternative translations that use different pronouns than the reference. Our test set, and our protocol of generating contrastive examples, is focused on selected pronouns to minimize the risk of producing contrastive examples that are actually valid translations.\nContrastive evaluation requires a large set of suitable examples that involve the translation of pronouns. As additional goals, our test set is designed to 1) focus on hard cases, so that it can be used as a benchmark to track progress in context-aware translation and 2) allow for fine-grained analysis.\nSection SECREF14 describes how we extract our data set. Section SECREF26 explains how, given a set of contrastive examples, contrastive evaluation works.\nWe automatically create a test set from the OpenSubtitles corpus BIBREF22 . The goal is to provide a large number of difficult test cases where an English pronoun has to be translated to a German pronoun.\nThe most challenging cases are translating it to either er, sie or es, depending on the grammatical gender of the antecedent. Not only is the translation of it ambiguous, there is also class imbalance in the training data (see Table TABREF18 ). There is roughly a 30% probability that it is aligned to es, which makes it difficult to learn to translate er and sie. We use parsing and automatic co-reference resolution to find translation pairs that satisfy our constraints.\nTo provide a basis for filtering with constraints, we tokenize the whole data set with the Moses tokenizer, generate symmetric word alignments with fast_align BIBREF23 , parse the English text with CoreNLP BIBREF24 , parse the German text with ParZu BIBREF25 and perform coreference resolution on both sides. The coreference chains are obtained with the neural model of CoreNLP for English, and with CorZu for German BIBREF26 , respectively.\nThen we opt for high-precision, aggressive filtering, according to the following protocol: for each pair of sentences INLINEFORM0 in English and German, extract iff\n INLINEFORM0 contains the English pronoun it, and INLINEFORM1 contains a German pronoun that is third person singular (er, sie or es), as indicated by their part-of-speech tags;\nthose pronouns are aligned to each other;\nboth pronouns are in a coreference chain;\ntheir nominal antecedents in the coreference chain are aligned on word level.\nThis removes most candidate pairs, but is necessary to overcome the noise introduced by our preprocessing pipeline, most notably coreference resolution. From the filtered set, we create a balanced test set by randomly sampling 4000 instances of each of the three translations of it under consideration (er, sie, es). We do not balance antecedent distance. See Table TABREF25 for the distribution of pronoun pairs and antecedent distance in the test set.\nFor each sentence pair in the resulting test set, we introduce contrastive translations. A contrastive translation is a translation variant where the correct pronoun is swapped with an incorrect one. For an example, see Table TABREF19 , where the pronoun it in the original translation corresponds to sie because the antecedent bat is a feminine noun in German (Fledermaus). We produce wrong translations by replacing sie with one of the other pronouns (er, es).\nNote that, by themselves, these contrastive translations are grammatically correct if the antecedent is outside the current sentence. The test set also contains pronouns with an antecedent in the same sentence (antecedent distance 0). Those examples do not require any additional context for disambiguation and we therefore expect the sentence-level baseline to perform well on them.\nWe take extra care to ensure that the resulting contrastive translations are grammatically correct, because ungrammatical sentences are easily dismissed by an NMT system. For instance, if there are any possessive pronouns (such as seine) in the sentence, we also change their gender to match the personal pronoun replacement.\nThe German coreference resolution system does not resolve es because most instances of es in German are either non-referential forms, or they refer to a clause instead of a nominal antecedent. We limit the test set to nominal antecedents, as these are the only ambiguous cases with respect to translation. For this reason, we have to rely entirely on the English coreference links for the extraction of sentence pairs with it INLINEFORM0 es, as opposed to pairs with it INLINEFORM1 er and it INLINEFORM2 sie where we have coreference chains in both languages.\nOur extraction process respects document boundaries, to ensure we always search for the right context. We extract additional information from the annotated documents, such as the distance (in sentences) between pronouns and their antecedents, the document of origin, lemma, morphology and dependency information if available.\nContrastive evaluation is different from conventional evaluation of machine translation in that it does not require any translation. Rather than testing a model's ability to translate, it is a method to test a model's ability to discriminate between given good and bad translations.\nWe exploit the fact that NMT systems are in fact language models of the target language, conditioned on source text. Like language models, NMT systems can be used to compute a model score (the negative log probability) for an existing translation. Contrastive evaluation, then, means to compare the model score of two pairs of inputs: INLINEFORM0 and INLINEFORM1 . If the model score of the actual reference translation is higher, we assume that this model can detect wrong pronoun translations.\nHowever, this does not mean that systems actually produce the reference translation when given the source sentence for translation. An entirely different target sequence might rank higher in the system's beam during decoding. The only conclusion permitted by contrastive evaluation is whether or not the reference translation is more probable than a contrastive variant.\nIf the model score of the reference is indeed higher, we refer to this outcome as a \u201ccorrect decision\u201d by the model. The model's decision is only correct if the reference translation has a higher score than any contrastive translation. In our evaluation, we aggregate model decisions on the whole test set and report the overall percentage of correct decisions as accuracy.\nDuring scoring, the model is provided with reference translations as target context, while during translation, the model needs to predict the full sequence. It is an open question to what extent performance deteriorates when context is itself predicted, and thus noisy. We highlight that the same problem arises for sentence-level NMT, and has been addressed with alternative training strategies BIBREF27 .\nWe consider the following recurrent baselines:\nbaseline Our baseline model is a standard bidirectional RNN model with attention, trained with Nematus. It operates on the sentence level and does not see any additional context. The input and output embeddings of the decoder are tied, encoder embeddings are not.\nconcat22 We concatenate each sentence with one preceding sentence, for both the source and target side of the corpus. Then we train on this new data set without any changes to the model architecture. This very simple method is inspired by BIBREF5 .\nThe following models are taken, or slightly adapted, from BIBREF9 . For this reason, we give only a very short description of them here and the reader is referred to their work for details.\ns-hier A multi-encoder architecture with hierarchical attention. This model has access to one additional context: the previous source sentence. It is read by a separate encoder, and attended to by an additional attention network. The output of the resulting two attention vectors is combined with yet another attention network.\ns-t-hier Identical to s-hier, except that it considers two additional contexts: the previous source sentence and previous target sentence. Both are read by separate encoders, and sequences from all encoders are combined with hierarchical attention.\ns-hier-to-2 The model has an additional encoder for source context, whereas the target side of the corpus is concatenated, in the same way as for concat22. This model achieved the best results in BIBREF9 .\nFor each variant, we also introduce and test weight tying: we share the parameters of embedding matrices between encoders that read the same kind of text (source or target side).\nAll remaining models are based on the Transformer architecture BIBREF2 . A Transformer avoids recurrence completely: it follows an encoder-decoder architecture using stacked self-attention and fully connected layers for both the encoder and decoder.\nbaseline A standard context-agnostic Transformer. All model parameters are identical to a Transformer-base in BIBREF2 .\nconcat22 A simple concatentation model where only the training data is modified, in the same way as for the recurrent concat22 model.\nconcat21 Trained on data where the preceding sentence is concatenated to the current one only on the source side. This model is also taken from BIBREF5 .\n BIBREF8 A more sophisticated context-aware Transformer that uses source context only. It has a separate encoder for source context, but all layers except the last one are shared between encoders. A source and context sentence are first encoded independently, and then a single attention layer and a gating function are used to produce a context-aware representation of the source sentence. Such restricted interaction with context is shown to be beneficial for analysis of contextual phenomena captured by the model. For details the reader is referred to their work.\nWe train all models on the data from the WMT 2017 English INLINEFORM0 German news translation shared task ( INLINEFORM1 5.8 million sentence pairs). These corpora do not have document boundaries, therefore a small fraction of sentences will be paired with wrong context, but we expect the model to be robust against occasional random context (see also BIBREF8 ). Experimental setups for the RNN and Transformer models are different, and we describe them separately.\nAll RNN-based models are trained with Nematus BIBREF28 . We learn a joint BPE model with 89.5k merge operations BIBREF29 . We train shallow models with an embedding size of 512, a hidden layer size of 1024 and layer normalization. Models are trained with Adam BIBREF30 , with an initial learning rate of 0.0001. We apply early stopping based on validation perplexity. The batch size for training is 80, and the maximum length of training sequences is 100 (if input sentences are concatenated) or 50 (if input lines are single sentences).\nFor our Transformer-based experiments, we use a custom implementation and follow the hyperparameters from BIBREF2 , BIBREF8 . Systems are trained on lowercased text that was encoded using BPE (32k merge operations). Models consist of 6 encoder and decoder layers with 8 attention heads. The hidden state size is 512, the size of feedforward layers is 2048.\nModel performance is evaluated in terms of BLEU, on newstest2017, newstest2018 and all sentence pairs from our pronoun test set. We compute scores with SacreBLEU BIBREF31 . Evaluation with BLEU is done mainly to control for overall translation quality.\nTo evaluate pronoun translation, we perform contrastive evaluation and report the accuracy of models on our contrastive test set.\nThe BLEU scores in Table TABREF30 show a moderate improvement for most context-aware systems. This suggests that the architectural changes for the context-aware models do not degrade overall translation quality. The contrastive evaluation on our test set on the other hand shows a clear increase in the accuracy of pronoun translation: The best model s-hier-to-2.tied achieves a total of +16 percentage points accuracy on the test set over the baseline, see Table TABREF31 .\nTable TABREF32 shows that context-aware models perform better than the baseline when the antecedent is outside the current sentence. In our experiments, all context-aware models consider one preceding sentence as context. The evaluation according to the distance of the antecedent in Table TABREF35 confirms that the subset of sentences with antecedent distance 1 benefits most from the tested context-aware models (up to +20 percentage points accuracy). However, we note two surprising patterns:\nThe first observation can be explained by the distribution of German pronouns in the test set. The further away the antecedent, the higher the percentage of it INLINEFORM0 es cases, which are the majority class, and thus the class that will be predicted most often if evidence for other classes is lacking. We speculate that this is due to our more permissive extraction heuristics for it INLINEFORM1 es.\nWe attribute the second observation to the existence of coreference chains where the preceding sentence contains a pronoun that refers to the same nominal antecedent as the pronoun in the current sentence. Consider the example in Table TABREF36 : The nominal antecedent of it in the current sentence is door, T\u00fcr in German with feminine gender. The nominal antecedent occurs two sentences before the current sentence, but the German sentence in between contains the pronoun sie, which is a useful signal for the context-aware models, even though they cannot know the nominal antecedent.\nNote that only models aware of target-side context can benefit from such circumstances: The s-hier models as well as the Transformer model by BIBREF8 only see source side context, which results in lower accuracy if the distance to the antecedent is INLINEFORM0 1, see Table TABREF35 .\nWhile such coreference chains complicate the interpretation of the results, we note that improvements on inter-sentential anaphora with antecedent distance INLINEFORM0 are relatively small (compared to distance 1), and that performance is still relatively poor (especially for the minority classes er and sie). We encourage evaluation of wider-context models on this subset, which is still large thanks to the size of the full test set.\nRegarding the comparison of different context-aware architectures, our results demonstrate the effectiveness of parameter sharing between the main encoder (or decoder) and the contextual encoder. We observe an improvement of 5 percentage points from s-hier-to-2 to s-hier-to-2.tied, and 4 percentage points from s-t-hier to s-t-hier.tied. Context encoders introduce a large number of extra parameters, while inter-sentential context is only relevant for a relatively small number of predictions. We hypothesize that the training signal is thus too weak to train a strong contextual encoder in an end-to-end fashion without parameter sharing. Our results also confirm the finding by BIBREF9 that multi-encoder architectures, specifically s-hier-to-2(.tied), can outperform a simple concatenation system in the translation of coreferential pronouns.\nThe Transformer-based models perform strongest on pronouns with intra-segmental antecedent, outperforming the recurrent baseline by 9\u201318 percentage points. This is likely an effect of increased model depth and the self-attentional architecture in this set of experiments. The model by BIBREF8 only uses source context, and outperforms the most comparable RNN system, s-hier.tied. However, the Transformer-based concat22 slightly underperforms the RNN-based concat22, and we consider it future research how to better exploit target context with Transformer-based models.\nWe present a large-scale test suite to specifically test the capacity of NMT models to translate pronouns correctly. The test set contains 12,000 difficult cases of pronoun translations from English it to its German counterparts er, sie and es, extracted automatically from OpenSubtitles BIBREF22 .\nWe evaluate recently proposed context-aware models on our test set. Even though the increase in BLEU score is moderate for all context-aware models, the improvement in the translation of pronouns is considerable: The best model (s-hier-to-2.tied) achieves a +16 percentage points gain in accuracy over the baseline.\nOur experiments confirm the importance of careful architecture design, with multi-encoder architectures outperforming a model that simply concatenates context sentences. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of parameter sharing between encoders of a context-aware model.\nWe hope the test set will prove useful for empirically validating novel architectures for context-aware NMT. So far, we have only evaluated models that consider one sentence of context, but the nominal antecedent is more distant for a sizable proportion of the test set, and the evaluation of variable-size context models BIBREF7 , BIBREF10 is interesting future work.\nWe are grateful to the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF) for supporting the project CoNTra (grant number 105212_169888).", "question": "what are the baselines?", "expected_output": "bidirectional RNN model with attention.

Hence, future editions only provided target-side lemmas instead of fully inflected forms, which makes the task less suitable to evaluate end-to-end neural machine translation systems, although such systems have been trained on the task BIBREF18 .\n BIBREF17 do not report on the proportion of intra-sentential and inter-sentential anaphora in their test set, but the two top-performing systems only made use of intra-sentential information. Our test suite focuses on allowing the comparison of end-to-end context-aware NMT systems, and we thus extract a large number of inter-sentential anaphora, with meta-data allowing for a focus on inter-sentential anaphora with a long distance between the pronoun and its antecedent. Our focus on evaluating end-to-end NMT systems also relieves us from having to provide annotated training sets, and reduces pressure to achieve balance and full coverage of phenomena.\nAn alternative approach to automatically evaluate pronoun translation are reference-based methods that produce a score based on word alignment between source, translation output, and reference translation, and identification of pronouns in them, such as AutoPRF BIBREF19 and APT BIBREF20 . BIBREF21 perform a human meta-evaluation and show substantial disagreement between reference-based metrics and human judges, especially because there often exist valid alternative translations that use different pronouns than the reference. Our test set, and our protocol of generating contrastive examples, is focused on selected pronouns to minimize the risk of producing contrastive examples that are actually valid translations.\nContrastive evaluation requires a large set of suitable examples that involve the translation of pronouns. As additional goals, our test set is designed to 1) focus on hard cases, so that it can be used as a benchmark to track progress in context-aware translation and 2) allow for fine-grained analysis.\nSection SECREF14 describes how we extract our data set. Section SECREF26 explains how, given a set of contrastive examples, contrastive evaluation works.\nWe automatically create a test set from the OpenSubtitles corpus BIBREF22 . The goal is to provide a large number of difficult test cases where an English pronoun has to be translated to a German pronoun.\nThe most challenging cases are translating it to either er, sie or es, depending on the grammatical gender of the antecedent. Not only is the translation of it ambiguous, there is also class imbalance in the training data (see Table TABREF18 ). There is roughly a 30% probability that it is aligned to es, which makes it difficult to learn to translate er and sie. We use parsing and automatic co-reference resolution to find translation pairs that satisfy our constraints.\nTo provide a basis for filtering with constraints, we tokenize the whole data set with the Moses tokenizer, generate symmetric word alignments with fast_align BIBREF23 , parse the English text with CoreNLP BIBREF24 , parse the German text with ParZu BIBREF25 and perform coreference resolution on both sides. The coreference chains are obtained with the neural model of CoreNLP for English, and with CorZu for German BIBREF26 , respectively.\nThen we opt for high-precision, aggressive filtering, according to the following protocol: for each pair of sentences INLINEFORM0 in English and German, extract iff\n INLINEFORM0 contains the English pronoun it, and INLINEFORM1 contains a German pronoun that is third person singular (er, sie or es), as indicated by their part-of-speech tags;\nthose pronouns are aligned to each other;\nboth pronouns are in a coreference chain;\ntheir nominal antecedents in the coreference chain are aligned on word level.\nThis removes most candidate pairs, but is necessary to overcome the noise introduced by our preprocessing pipeline, most notably coreference resolution. From the filtered set, we create a balanced test set by randomly sampling 4000 instances of each of the three translations of it under consideration (er, sie, es). We do not balance antecedent distance. See Table TABREF25 for the distribution of pronoun pairs and antecedent distance in the test set.\nFor each sentence pair in the resulting test set, we introduce contrastive translations. A contrastive translation is a translation variant where the correct pronoun is swapped with an incorrect one. For an example, see Table TABREF19 , where the pronoun it in the original translation corresponds to sie because the antecedent bat is a feminine noun in German (Fledermaus). We produce wrong translations by replacing sie with one of the other pronouns (er, es).\nNote that, by themselves, these contrastive translations are grammatically correct if the antecedent is outside the current sentence. The test set also contains pronouns with an antecedent in the same sentence (antecedent distance 0). Those examples do not require any additional context for disambiguation and we therefore expect the sentence-level baseline to perform well on them.\nWe take extra care to ensure that the resulting contrastive translations are grammatically correct, because ungrammatical sentences are easily dismissed by an NMT system. For instance, if there are any possessive pronouns (such as seine) in the sentence, we also change their gender to match the personal pronoun replacement.\nThe German coreference resolution system does not resolve es because most instances of es in German are either non-referential forms, or they refer to a clause instead of a nominal antecedent. We limit the test set to nominal antecedents, as these are the only ambiguous cases with respect to translation. For this reason, we have to rely entirely on the English coreference links for the extraction of sentence pairs with it INLINEFORM0 es, as opposed to pairs with it INLINEFORM1 er and it INLINEFORM2 sie where we have coreference chains in both languages.\nOur extraction process respects document boundaries, to ensure we always search for the right context. We extract additional information from the annotated documents, such as the distance (in sentences) between pronouns and their antecedents, the document of origin, lemma, morphology and dependency information if available.\nContrastive evaluation is different from conventional evaluation of machine translation in that it does not require any translation. Rather than testing a model's ability to translate, it is a method to test a model's ability to discriminate between given good and bad translations.\nWe exploit the fact that NMT systems are in fact language models of the target language, conditioned on source text. Like language models, NMT systems can be used to compute a model score (the negative log probability) for an existing translation. Contrastive evaluation, then, means to compare the model score of two pairs of inputs: INLINEFORM0 and INLINEFORM1 . If the model score of the actual reference translation is higher, we assume that this model can detect wrong pronoun translations.\nHowever, this does not mean that systems actually produce the reference translation when given the source sentence for translation. An entirely different target sequence might rank higher in the system's beam during decoding. The only conclusion permitted by contrastive evaluation is whether or not the reference translation is more probable than a contrastive variant.\nIf the model score of the reference is indeed higher, we refer to this outcome as a \u201ccorrect decision\u201d by the model. The model's decision is only correct if the reference translation has a higher score than any contrastive translation. In our evaluation, we aggregate model decisions on the whole test set and report the overall percentage of correct decisions as accuracy.\nDuring scoring, the model is provided with reference translations as target context, while during translation, the model needs to predict the full sequence. It is an open question to what extent performance deteriorates when context is itself predicted, and thus noisy. We highlight that the same problem arises for sentence-level NMT, and has been addressed with alternative training strategies BIBREF27 .\nWe consider the following recurrent baselines:\nbaseline Our baseline model is a standard bidirectional RNN model with attention, trained with Nematus. It operates on the sentence level and does not see any additional context. The input and output embeddings of the decoder are tied, encoder embeddings are not.\nconcat22 We concatenate each sentence with one preceding sentence, for both the source and target side of the corpus. Then we train on this new data set without any changes to the model architecture. This very simple method is inspired by BIBREF5 .\nThe following models are taken, or slightly adapted, from BIBREF9 . For this reason, we give only a very short description of them here and the reader is referred to their work for details.\ns-hier A multi-encoder architecture with hierarchical attention. This model has access to one additional context: the previous source sentence. It is read by a separate encoder, and attended to by an additional attention network. The output of the resulting two attention vectors is combined with yet another attention network.\ns-t-hier Identical to s-hier, except that it considers two additional contexts: the previous source sentence and previous target sentence. Both are read by separate encoders, and sequences from all encoders are combined with hierarchical attention.\ns-hier-to-2 The model has an additional encoder for source context, whereas the target side of the corpus is concatenated, in the same way as for concat22. This model achieved the best results in BIBREF9 .\nFor each variant, we also introduce and test weight tying: we share the parameters of embedding matrices between encoders that read the same kind of text (source or target side).\nAll remaining models are based on the Transformer architecture BIBREF2 . A Transformer avoids recurrence completely: it follows an encoder-decoder architecture using stacked self-attention and fully connected layers for both the encoder and decoder.\nbaseline A standard context-agnostic Transformer. All model parameters are identical to a Transformer-base in BIBREF2 .\nconcat22 A simple concatentation model where only the training data is modified, in the same way as for the recurrent concat22 model.\nconcat21 Trained on data where the preceding sentence is concatenated to the current one only on the source side. This model is also taken from BIBREF5 .\n BIBREF8 A more sophisticated context-aware Transformer that uses source context only. It has a separate encoder for source context, but all layers except the last one are shared between encoders. A source and context sentence are first encoded independently, and then a single attention layer and a gating function are used to produce a context-aware representation of the source sentence. Such restricted interaction with context is shown to be beneficial for analysis of contextual phenomena captured by the model. For details the reader is referred to their work.\nWe train all models on the data from the WMT 2017 English INLINEFORM0 German news translation shared task ( INLINEFORM1 5.8 million sentence pairs). These corpora do not have document boundaries, therefore a small fraction of sentences will be paired with wrong context, but we expect the model to be robust against occasional random context (see also BIBREF8 ). Experimental setups for the RNN and Transformer models are different, and we describe them separately.\nAll RNN-based models are trained with Nematus BIBREF28 . We learn a joint BPE model with 89.5k merge operations BIBREF29 . We train shallow models with an embedding size of 512, a hidden layer size of 1024 and layer normalization. Models are trained with Adam BIBREF30 , with an initial learning rate of 0.0001. We apply early stopping based on validation perplexity. The batch size for training is 80, and the maximum length of training sequences is 100 (if input sentences are concatenated) or 50 (if input lines are single sentences).\nFor our Transformer-based experiments, we use a custom implementation and follow the hyperparameters from BIBREF2 , BIBREF8 . Systems are trained on lowercased text that was encoded using BPE (32k merge operations). Models consist of 6 encoder and decoder layers with 8 attention heads. The hidden state size is 512, the size of feedforward layers is 2048.\nModel performance is evaluated in terms of BLEU, on newstest2017, newstest2018 and all sentence pairs from our pronoun test set. We compute scores with SacreBLEU BIBREF31 . Evaluation with BLEU is done mainly to control for overall translation quality.\nTo evaluate pronoun translation, we perform contrastive evaluation and report the accuracy of models on our contrastive test set.\nThe BLEU scores in Table TABREF30 show a moderate improvement for most context-aware systems. This suggests that the architectural changes for the context-aware models do not degrade overall translation quality. The contrastive evaluation on our test set on the other hand shows a clear increase in the accuracy of pronoun translation: The best model s-hier-to-2.tied achieves a total of +16 percentage points accuracy on the test set over the baseline, see Table TABREF31 .\nTable TABREF32 shows that context-aware models perform better than the baseline when the antecedent is outside the current sentence. In our experiments, all context-aware models consider one preceding sentence as context. The evaluation according to the distance of the antecedent in Table TABREF35 confirms that the subset of sentences with antecedent distance 1 benefits most from the tested context-aware models (up to +20 percentage points accuracy). However, we note two surprising patterns:\nThe first observation can be explained by the distribution of German pronouns in the test set. The further away the antecedent, the higher the percentage of it INLINEFORM0 es cases, which are the majority class, and thus the class that will be predicted most often if evidence for other classes is lacking. We speculate that this is due to our more permissive extraction heuristics for it INLINEFORM1 es.\nWe attribute the second observation to the existence of coreference chains where the preceding sentence contains a pronoun that refers to the same nominal antecedent as the pronoun in the current sentence. Consider the example in Table TABREF36 : The nominal antecedent of it in the current sentence is door, T\u00fcr in German with feminine gender. The nominal antecedent occurs two sentences before the current sentence, but the German sentence in between contains the pronoun sie, which is a useful signal for the context-aware models, even though they cannot know the nominal antecedent.\nNote that only models aware of target-side context can benefit from such circumstances: The s-hier models as well as the Transformer model by BIBREF8 only see source side context, which results in lower accuracy if the distance to the antecedent is INLINEFORM0 1, see Table TABREF35 .\nWhile such coreference chains complicate the interpretation of the results, we note that improvements on inter-sentential anaphora with antecedent distance INLINEFORM0 are relatively small (compared to distance 1), and that performance is still relatively poor (especially for the minority classes er and sie). We encourage evaluation of wider-context models on this subset, which is still large thanks to the size of the full test set.\nRegarding the comparison of different context-aware architectures, our results demonstrate the effectiveness of parameter sharing between the main encoder (or decoder) and the contextual encoder. We observe an improvement of 5 percentage points from s-hier-to-2 to s-hier-to-2.tied, and 4 percentage points from s-t-hier to s-t-hier.tied. Context encoders introduce a large number of extra parameters, while inter-sentential context is only relevant for a relatively small number of predictions. We hypothesize that the training signal is thus too weak to train a strong contextual encoder in an end-to-end fashion without parameter sharing. Our results also confirm the finding by BIBREF9 that multi-encoder architectures, specifically s-hier-to-2(.tied), can outperform a simple concatenation system in the translation of coreferential pronouns.\nThe Transformer-based models perform strongest on pronouns with intra-segmental antecedent, outperforming the recurrent baseline by 9\u201318 percentage points. This is likely an effect of increased model depth and the self-attentional architecture in this set of experiments. The model by BIBREF8 only uses source context, and outperforms the most comparable RNN system, s-hier.tied. However, the Transformer-based concat22 slightly underperforms the RNN-based concat22, and we consider it future research how to better exploit target context with Transformer-based models.\nWe present a large-scale test suite to specifically test the capacity of NMT models to translate pronouns correctly. The test set contains 12,000 difficult cases of pronoun translations from English it to its German counterparts er, sie and es, extracted automatically from OpenSubtitles BIBREF22 .\nWe evaluate recently proposed context-aware models on our test set. Even though the increase in BLEU score is moderate for all context-aware models, the improvement in the translation of pronouns is considerable: The best model (s-hier-to-2.tied) achieves a +16 percentage points gain in accuracy over the baseline.\nOur experiments confirm the importance of careful architecture design, with multi-encoder architectures outperforming a model that simply concatenates context sentences. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of parameter sharing between encoders of a context-aware model.\nWe hope the test set will prove useful for empirically validating novel architectures for context-aware NMT. So far, we have only evaluated models that consider one sentence of context, but the nominal antecedent is more distant for a sizable proportion of the test set, and the evaluation of variable-size context models BIBREF7 , BIBREF10 is interesting future work.\nWe are grateful to the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF) for supporting the project CoNTra (grant number 105212_169888).", "question": "what context aware models were experimented?", "expected_output": "standard bidirectional RNN model with attention.

{"id": "1810.02268", "prompt": "Even though machine translation has improved considerably with the advent of neural machine translation (NMT) BIBREF0 , BIBREF1 , the translation of pronouns remains a major issue. They are notoriously hard to translate since they often require context outside the current sentence.\nAs an example, consider the sentences in Figure FIGREF1 . In both languages, there is a pronoun in the second sentence that refers to the European Central Bank. When the second sentence is translated from English to German, the translation of the pronoun it is ambiguous. This ambiguity can only be resolved with context awareness: if a translation system has access to the previous English sentence, the previous German translation, or both, it can determine the antecedent the pronoun refers to. In this German sentence, the antecedent Europ\u00e4ische Zentralbank dictates the feminine gender of the pronoun sie.\nIt is unfortunate, then, that current NMT systems generally operate on the sentence level BIBREF2 , BIBREF3 , BIBREF4 . Documents are translated sentence-by-sentence for practical reasons, such as line-based processing in a pipeline and reduced computational complexity. Furthermore, improvements of larger-context models over baselines in terms of document-level metrics such as BLEU or RIBES have been moderate, so that their computational overhead does not seem justified, and so that it is hard to develop more effective context-aware architectures and empirically validate them.\nTo address this issue, we present an alternative way of evaluating larger-context models on a test set that allows to specifically measure a model's capability to correctly translate pronouns. The test suite consists of pairs of source and target sentences, in combination with contrastive translation variants (for evaluation by model scoring) and additional linguistic and contextual information (for further analysis). The resource is freely available. Additionally, we evaluate several context-aware models that have recently been proposed in the literature on this test set, and extend existing models with parameter tying.\nThe main contributions of our paper are:\nSection SECREF2 explains how our paper relates to existing work on context-aware models and the evaluation of pronoun translation. Section SECREF3 describes our test suite. The context-aware models we use in our experiments are detailed in Section SECREF4 . We discuss our experiments in Section SECREF5 and the results in Section SECREF6 .\nTwo lines of work are related to our paper: research on context-aware translation (described in Section SECREF8 ) and research on focused evaluation of pronoun translation (described in Section SECREF11 ).\nIf the translation of a pronoun requires context beyond the current sentence (see the example in Figure FIGREF1 ), a natural extension of sentence-level NMT models is to condition the model prediction on this necessary context. In the following, we describe a number of existing approaches to making models \u201caware\u201d of additional context.\nThe simplest possible extension is to translate units larger than sentences. BIBREF5 concatenate each sentence with the sentence that precedes it, for the source side of the corpus or both sides. All of their models are standard sequence-to-sequence models built with recurrent neural networks (RNNs), since the method does not require any architectural change. BIBREF11 use the same concatenation technique with a Transformer architecture BIBREF2 , and experiment with wider context.\nA number of works do propose changes to the NMT architecture. A common technique is to extend a standard encoder-decoder model by additional encoders for the context sentence(s), with a modified attention mechanism BIBREF6 , BIBREF9 , BIBREF8 . One aspect that differs between these works is the architecture of the encoder and attention. While BIBREF6 , BIBREF9 extend an RNN encoder-decoder with a second encoder that the decoder attends to, BIBREF8 extend the Transformer architecture with an encoder that is attended to by the main encoder. BIBREF8 also introduce parameter sharing between the main encoder and the context encoder, but do not empirically demonstrate its importance.\nWhile the number of encoded sentences in the previous work is fixed, BIBREF7 , BIBREF10 explore the integration of variable-size context through a hierarchical architecture, where a first-level RNN reads in words to produce sentence vectors, which are then fed into a second-level RNN to produce a document summary.\nApart from differences in the architectures, related work varies in whether it considers source context, target context, or both (see Table TABREF9 for an overview of language arcs and context types). Some work considers only source context, but for pronoun translation, target-side context is intuitively important for disambiguation, especially if the antecedent itself is ambiguous. In our evaluation, we therefore emphasize models that take into account both source and target context.\nOur experiments are based on models from BIBREF9 , who have released their source code. We extend their models with parameter sharing, which was shown to be beneficial by BIBREF8 . Additionally, we consider a concatenative baseline, similar to BIBREF5 , and Transformer-based models BIBREF8 .\nThis section describes several context-aware NMT models that we use in our experiments. They fall into two major categories: models based on RNNs and models based on the Transformer architecture BIBREF2 . We experiment with additional context on the source side and target side.\nPronouns can serve a variety of functions with complex cross-lingual variation BIBREF12 , and hand-picked, manually annotated test suites have been presented for the evaluation of pronoun translation BIBREF13 , BIBREF14 , BIBREF9 . While suitable for analysis, the small size of the test suites makes it hard to make statistically confident comparisons between systems, and the hand-picked nature of the test suites introduces biases. To overcome these problems, we opted for a fully automatic approach to constructing a large-scale test suite.\nConceptually, our test set is most similar to the \u201ccross-lingual pronoun prediction\u201d task held at DiscoMT and WMT in recent years BIBREF15 , BIBREF16 , BIBREF17 : participants are asked to fill a gap in a target sentence, where gaps correspond to pronouns.\nThe first edition of the task focused on English INLINEFORM0 French, and it was found that local context (such as the verb group) was a strong signal for pronoun prediction. Hence, future editions only provided target-side lemmas instead of fully inflected forms, which makes the task less suitable to evaluate end-to-end neural machine translation systems, although such systems have been trained on the task BIBREF18 .\n BIBREF17 do not report on the proportion of intra-sentential and inter-sentential anaphora in their test set, but the two top-performing systems only made use of intra-sentential information. Our test suite focuses on allowing the comparison of end-to-end context-aware NMT systems, and we thus extract a large number of inter-sentential anaphora, with meta-data allowing for a focus on inter-sentential anaphora with a long distance between the pronoun and its antecedent. Our focus on evaluating end-to-end NMT systems also relieves us from having to provide annotated training sets, and reduces pressure to achieve balance and full coverage of phenomena.\nAn alternative approach to automatically evaluate pronoun translation are reference-based methods that produce a score based on word alignment between source, translation output, and reference translation, and identification of pronouns in them, such as AutoPRF BIBREF19 and APT BIBREF20 .

We do not balance antecedent distance. See Table TABREF25 for the distribution of pronoun pairs and antecedent distance in the test set.\nFor each sentence pair in the resulting test set, we introduce contrastive translations. A contrastive translation is a translation variant where the correct pronoun is swapped with an incorrect one. For an example, see Table TABREF19 , where the pronoun it in the original translation corresponds to sie because the antecedent bat is a feminine noun in German (Fledermaus). We produce wrong translations by replacing sie with one of the other pronouns (er, es).\nNote that, by themselves, these contrastive translations are grammatically correct if the antecedent is outside the current sentence.

We limit the test set to nominal antecedents, as these are the only ambiguous cases with respect to translation. For this reason, we have to rely entirely on the English coreference links for the extraction of sentence pairs with it INLINEFORM0 es, as opposed to pairs with it INLINEFORM1 er and it INLINEFORM2 sie where we have coreference chains in both languages.\nOur extraction process respects document boundaries, to ensure we always search for the right context. We extract additional information from the annotated documents, such as the distance (in sentences) between pronouns and their antecedents, the document of origin, lemma, morphology and dependency information if available.\nContrastive evaluation is different from conventional evaluation of machine translation in that it does not require any translation.

The hidden state size is 512, the size of feedforward layers is 2048.\nModel performance is evaluated in terms of BLEU, on newstest2017, newstest2018 and all sentence pairs from our pronoun test set. We compute scores with SacreBLEU BIBREF31 . Evaluation with BLEU is done mainly to control for overall translation quality.\nTo evaluate pronoun translation, we perform contrastive evaluation and report the accuracy of models on our contrastive test set.\nThe BLEU scores in Table TABREF30 show a moderate improvement for most context-aware systems. This suggests that the architectural changes for the context-aware models do not degrade overall translation quality. The contrastive evaluation on our test set on the other hand shows a clear increase in the accuracy of pronoun translation: The best model s-hier-to-2.tied achieves a total of +16 percentage points accuracy on the test set over the baseline, see Table TABREF31 .\nTable TABREF32 shows that context-aware models perform better than the baseline when the antecedent is outside the current sentence. In our experiments, all context-aware models consider one preceding sentence as context. The evaluation according to the distance of the antecedent in Table TABREF35 confirms that the subset of sentences with antecedent distance 1 benefits most from the tested context-aware models (up to +20 percentage points accuracy). However, we note two surprising patterns:\nThe first observation can be explained by the distribution of German pronouns in the test set. The further away the antecedent, the higher the percentage of it INLINEFORM0 es cases, which are the majority class, and thus the class that will be predicted most often if evidence for other classes is lacking. We speculate that this is due to our more permissive extraction heuristics for it INLINEFORM1 es.\nWe attribute the second observation to the existence of coreference chains where the preceding sentence contains a pronoun that refers to the same nominal antecedent as the pronoun in the current sentence. Consider the example in Table TABREF36 : The nominal antecedent of it in the current sentence is door, T\u00fcr in German with feminine gender. The nominal antecedent occurs two sentences before the current sentence, but the German sentence in between contains the pronoun sie, which is a useful signal for the context-aware models, even though they cannot know the nominal antecedent.\nNote that only models aware of target-side context can benefit from such circumstances: The s-hier models as well as the Transformer model by BIBREF8 only see source side context, which results in lower accuracy if the distance to the antecedent is INLINEFORM0 1, see Table TABREF35 .\nWhile such coreference chains complicate the interpretation of the results, we note that improvements on inter-sentential anaphora with antecedent distance INLINEFORM0 are relatively small (compared to distance 1), and that performance is still relatively poor (especially for the minority classes er and sie). We encourage evaluation of wider-context models on this subset, which is still large thanks to the size of the full test set.\nRegarding the comparison of different context-aware architectures, our results demonstrate the effectiveness of parameter sharing between the main encoder (or decoder) and the contextual encoder. We observe an improvement of 5 percentage points from s-hier-to-2 to s-hier-to-2.tied, and 4 percentage points from s-t-hier to s-t-hier.tied. Context encoders introduce a large number of extra parameters, while inter-sentential context is only relevant for a relatively small number of predictions. We hypothesize that the training signal is thus too weak to train a strong contextual encoder in an end-to-end fashion without parameter sharing. Our results also confirm the finding by BIBREF9 that multi-encoder architectures, specifically s-hier-to-2(.tied), can outperform a simple concatenation system in the translation of coreferential pronouns.\nThe Transformer-based models perform strongest on pronouns with intra-segmental antecedent, outperforming the recurrent baseline by 9\u201318 percentage points. This is likely an effect of increased model depth and the self-attentional architecture in this set of experiments. The model by BIBREF8 only uses source context, and outperforms the most comparable RNN system, s-hier.tied. However, the Transformer-based concat22 slightly underperforms the RNN-based concat22, and we consider it future research how to better exploit target context with Transformer-based models.\nWe present a large-scale test suite to specifically test the capacity of NMT models to translate pronouns correctly. The test set contains 12,000 difficult cases of pronoun translations from English it to its German counterparts er, sie and es, extracted automatically from OpenSubtitles BIBREF22 .\nWe evaluate recently proposed context-aware models on our test set. Even though the increase in BLEU score is moderate for all context-aware models, the improvement in the translation of pronouns is considerable: The best model (s-hier-to-2.tied) achieves a +16 percentage points gain in accuracy over the baseline.\nOur experiments confirm the importance of careful architecture design, with multi-encoder architectures outperforming a model that simply concatenates context sentences. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of parameter sharing between encoders of a context-aware model.\nWe hope the test set will prove useful for empirically validating novel architectures for context-aware NMT. So far, we have only evaluated models that consider one sentence of context, but the nominal antecedent is more distant for a sizable proportion of the test set, and the evaluation of variable-size context models BIBREF7 , BIBREF10 is interesting future work.\nWe are grateful to the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF) for supporting the project CoNTra (grant number 105212_169888).", "question": "what languages did they experiment on?", "expected_output": "English.

{"id": "1909.12079", "prompt": "Given a piece of text and the span of an entity mention in this text, fine-grained entity typing (FET) is the task of assigning fine-grained type labels to the mention BIBREF0. The assigned labels should be context dependent BIBREF1. For example, in the sentence \u201cTrump threatens to pull US out of World Trade Organization,\u201d the mention \u201cTrump\u201d should be labeled as /person and /person/politician, although Donald Trump also had other occupations such as businessman, TV personality, etc.\nThis task is challenging because it usually uses a relatively large tag set, and some mentions may require the understanding of the context to be correctly labeled. Moreover, since manual annotation is very labor-intensive, existing approaches have to rely on distant supervision to train models BIBREF0, BIBREF2.\nThus, the use of extra information to help with the classification process becomes very important. In this paper, we improve FET with entity linking (EL). EL is helpful for a model to make typing decisions because if a mention is correctly linked to its target entity, we can directly obtain the type information about this entity in the knowledge base (KB). For example, in the sentence \u201cThere were some great discussions on a variety of issues facing Federal Way,\u201d the mention \u201cFederal Way\u201d may be incorrectly labeled as a company by some FET models. Such a mistake can be avoided after linking it to the city Federal Way, Washington. For cases that require the understanding of the context, using entity linking results is also beneficial. In the aforementioned example where \u201cTrump\u201d is the mention, obtaining all the types of Donald Trump in the knowledge base (e.g., politician, businessman, TV personality, etc.) is still informative for inferring the correct type (i.e., politician) that fits the context, since they narrows the possible labels down.\nHowever, the information obtained through EL should not be fully trusted since it is not always accurate. Even when a mention is correctly linked to an entity, the type information of this entity in the KB may be incomplete or outdated. Thus, in this paper, we propose a deep neural fine-grained entity typing model that flexibly predicts labels based on the context, the mention string, and the type information from KB obtained with EL.\nUsing EL also introduces a new problem for the training process. Currently, a widely used approach to create FET training samples is to use the anchor links in Wikipedia BIBREF0, BIBREF3. Each anchor link is regarded as a mention, and is weakly labeled with all the types of its referred entity (the Wikipedia page the anchor link points to) in KB. Our approach, when links the mention correctly, also uses all the types of the referred entity in KB as extra information. This may cause the trained model to overfit the weakly labeled data. We design a variant of the hinge loss and introduce noise during training to address this problem.\nWe conduct experiments on two commonly used FET datasets. Experimental results show that introducing information obtained through entity linking and having a deep neural model both helps to improve FET performance. Our model achieves more than 5% absolute strict accuracy improvement over the state of the art on both datasets.\nOur contributions are summarized as follows:\nWe propose a deep neural fine-grained entity typing model that utilizes type information from KB obtained through entity linking.\nWe address the problem that our model may overfit the weakly labeled data by using a variant of the hinge-loss and introducing noise during training.\nWe demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach with experimental results on commonly used FET datasets.\nOur code is available at https://github.com/HKUST-KnowComp/IFETEL.\nAn early effort of classifying named entities into fine-grained types can be found in BIBREF4, which only focuses on person names. Latter, datasets with larger type sets are constructed BIBREF5, BIBREF0, BIBREF6. These datasets are more preferred by recent studies BIBREF3, BIBREF7.\nMost of the existing approaches proposed for FET are learning based. The features used by these approaches can either be hand-crafted BIBREF0, BIBREF1 or learned from neural network models BIBREF8, BIBREF9, BIBREF10. Since FET systems usually use distant supervision for training, the labels of the training samples can be noisy, erroneous or overly specific. Several studies BIBREF11, BIBREF12, BIBREF9 address these problems by separating clean mentions and noisy mentions, modeling type correction BIBREF3, using a hierarchy-aware loss BIBREF9, etc.\nBIBREF13 and BIBREF14 are two studies that are most related to this paper. BIBREF13 propose an unsupervised FET system where EL is an importat component. But they use EL to help with clustering and type name selection, which is very different from how we use it to improve the performance of a supervised FET model. BIBREF14 finds related entities based on the context instead of directly applying EL. The types of these entities are then used for inferring the type of the mention.\nLet $T$ be a predefined tag set, which includes all the types we want to assign to mentions. Given a mention $m$ and its context, the task is to predict a set of types $\\mathbf {\\tau }\\subset T$ suitable for this mention. Thus, this is a multi-class, multi-label classification problem BIBREF0. Next, we will introduce our approach for this problem in detail, including the neural model, the training of the model, and the entity linking algorithm we use.\nEach input sample to our FET system contains one mention and the sentence it belongs to. We denote $w_1,w_2,...,w_n$ as the words in the current sentence, $w_{p_1},w_{p_2},...,w_{p_l}$ as the words in the mention string, where $n$ is the number of words in the sentence, $p_1,...,p_l$ are the indices of the words in the mention string, $l$ is the number of words in the mention string. We also use a set of pretrained word embeddings.\nOur FET approach is illustrated in Figure FIGREF4. It first constructs three representations: context representation, mention string representation, and KB type representation. Note that the KB type representation is obtained from a knowledge base through entity linking and is independent of the context of the mention.\nTo obtain the context representation, we first use a special token $w_m$ to represent the mention (the token \u201c[Mention]\u201d in Figure FIGREF4). Then, the word sequence of the sentence becomes $w_1,...,w_{p_l-1},w_m,w_{p_l+1},...,w_n$. Their corresponding word embeddings are fed into two layers of BiLSTMs. Let $\\mathbf {h}_m^1$ and $\\mathbf {h}_m^2$ be the output of the first and the second layer of BiLSTMs for $w_m$, respectively. We use $\\mathbf {f}_c=\\mathbf {h}_m^1+\\mathbf {h}_m^2$ as the context representation vector.\nLet $\\mathbf {x}_1,...,\\mathbf {x}_l$ be the word embeddings of the mention string words $w_{p_1},...,w_{p_l}$. Then the mention string representation $\\mathbf {f}_s=(\\sum _{i=1}^l \\mathbf {x}_i)/l$.\nTo obtain the KB type representation, we run an EL algorithm for the current mention. If the EL algorithm returns an entity, we retrieve the types of of this entity from the KB. We use Freebase as our KB. Since the types in Freebase is different from $T$, the target type set, they are mapped to the types in $T$ with rules similar to those used in BIBREF14. Afterwards, we perform one hot encoding on these types to get the KB Type Representation $\\mathbf {f}_e$. If the EL algorithm returns NIL (i.e., the mention cannot be linked to an entity), we simply one hot encode the empty type set.\nApart from the three representations, we also obtain the score returned by our entity linking algorithm, which indicates its confidence on the linking result. We denote it as a one dimensional vector $\\mathbf {g}$. Then, we get $\\mathbf {f}=\\mathbf {f}_c\\oplus \\mathbf {f}_s\\oplus \\mathbf {f}_e\\oplus \\mathbf {g}$, where $\\oplus $ means concatenation. $\\mathbf {f}$ is then fed into an MLP that contains three dense layers to obtain $\\mathbf {u}_m$, out final representation for the current mention sample $m$. Let $t_1,t_2,...,t_k$ be all the types in $T$, where $k=|T|$. We embed them into the same space as $\\mathbf {u}_m$ by assigning each of them a dense vector BIBREF15. These vectors are denoted as $\\mathbf {t}_1,...,\\mathbf {t}_k$. Then the score of the mention $m$ having the type $t_i\\in T$ is calculated as the dot product of $\\mathbf {u}_m$ and $\\mathbf {t}_i$:\nWe predict $t_i$ as a type of $m$ if $s(m,t_i)>0$.\nFollowing existing studies, we also generate training data by using the anchor links in Wikipedia. Each anchor link can be used as a mention. These mentions are labeled by mapping the Freebase types of the target entries to the tag set $T$ BIBREF0.\nSince the KB type representations we use in our FET model are also obtained through mapping Freebase types, they will perfectly match the automatically generated labels for the mentions that are correctly linked (i.e., when the entity returned by the EL algorithm and the target entry of the anchor link are the same). For example, in Figure FIGREF4, suppose the example sentence is a training sample obtained from Wikipedia, where \u201cDonald Trump\u201d is an anchor link points to the Wikipedia page of Donald Trump. After mapping the Freebase types of Donald Trump to the target tag set, this sample will be weakly annotated as /person/politician, /person/tv_personality, and /person/business, which is exactly the same as the type information (the \u201cTypes From KB\u201d in Figure FIGREF4) obtained through EL. Thus, during training, when the EL system links the mention to the correct entity, the model only needs to output the types in the KB type representation. This may cause the trained model to overfit the weakly labeled training data. For most types of entities such as locations and organizations, it is fine since they usually have the same types in different contexts. But it is problematic for person mentions, as their types can be context dependent.\nTo address this problem, during training, if a mention is linked to a person entity by our entity linking algorithm, we add a random fine-grained person type label that does not belong to this entity while generating the KB type representation. For example, if the mention is linked to a person with types /person/actor and /person/author, a random label /person/politician may be added. This will force the model to still infer the type labels from the context even when the mention is correctly linked, since the KB type representation no longer perfectly match the weak labels.\nTo make it more flexible, we also propose to use a variant of the hinge loss used by BIBREF16 to train our model:\nwhere $\\tau _m$ is the correct type set for mention $m$, $\\bar{\\tau }_m$ is the incorrect type set. $\\lambda (t)\\in [1,+\\infty )$ is a predefined parameter to impose a larger penalty if the type $t$ is incorrectly predicted as positive. Since the problem of overfitting the weakly annotated labels is more severe for person mentions, we set $\\lambda (t)=\\lambda _P$ if $t$ is a fine-grained person type, and $\\lambda (t)=1$ for all other types.\nDuring training, we also randomly set the EL results of half of the training samples to be NIL. So that the model can perform well for mentions that cannot be linked to the KB at test time.\nIn this paper, we use a simple EL algorithm that directly links the mention to the entity with the greatest commonness score. Commonness BIBREF17, BIBREF18 is calculated base on the anchor links in Wikipedia. It estimates the probability of an entity given only the mention string. In our FET approach, the commonness score is also used as the confidence on the linking result (i.e., the $\\mathbf {g}$ used in the prediction part of Subsection SECREF5). Within a same document, we also use the same heuristic used in BIBREF19 to find coreferences of generic mentions of persons (e.g., \u201cMatt\u201d) to more specific mentions (e.g., \u201cMatt Damon\u201d).\nWe also tried other more advanced EL methods in our experiments. However, they do not improve the final performance of our model. Experimental results of using the EL system proposed in BIBREF19 is provided in Section SECREF4.\nWe use two datasets: FIGER (GOLD) BIBREF0 and BBN BIBREF5. The sizes of their tag sets are 113 and 47, respectively. FIGER (GOLD) allows mentions to have multiple type paths, but BBN does not. Another commonly used dataset, OntoNotes BIBREF1, is not used since it contains many pronoun and common noun phrase mentions such as \u201cit,\u201d \u201che,\u201d \u201ca thrift institution,\u201d which are not suitable to directly apply entity linking on.\nFollowing BIBREF0, we generate weakly labeled datasets for training with Wikipedia anchor links. Since the tag sets used by FIGER (GOLD) and BBN are different, we create a training set for each of them. For each dataset, $2,000$ weakly labeled samples are randomly picked to form a development set. We also manually annotated 50 person mentions collected from news articles for tuning the parameter $\\lambda _P$.\nWe use the 300 dimensional pretrained GloVe word vectors provided by BIBREF20. The hidden layer sizes of the two layers of BiLSTMs are both set to 250. For the three-layer MLP, the size of the two hidden layers are both set to 500. The size of the type embeddings is 500. $\\lambda _P$ is set to 2.0. We also apply batch normalization and dropout to the input of each dense layer in our three-layer MLP during training.\nWe use strict accuracy, Macro F1, and Micro F1 to evaluate fine-grained typing performance BIBREF0.\nWe compare with the following existing approaches: AFET BIBREF3, AAA BIBREF16, NFETC BIBREF9, and CLSC BIBREF21.\nWe use Ours (Full) to represent our full model, and also compare with five variants of our own approach: Ours (DirectTrain) is trained without adding random person types while obtaining the KB type representation, and $\\lambda _P$ is set to 1; Ours (NoEL) does not use entity linking, i.e., the KB type representation and the entity linking confidence score are removed, and the model is trained in DirectTrain style; Ours (NonDeep) uses one BiLSTM layer and replaces the MLP with a dense layer; Ours (NonDeep NoEL) is the NoEL version of Ours (NonDeep); Ours (LocAttEL) uses the entity linking approach proposed in BIBREF19 instead of our own commonness based approach. Ours (Full), Ours (DirectTrain), and Ours (NonDeep) all use our own commonness based entity linking approach.\nThe experimental results are listed in Table TABREF16. As we can see, our approach performs much better than existing approaches on both datasets.\nThe benefit of using entity linking in our approach can be verified by comparing Ours (Full) and Ours (NoEL). The performance on both datasets decreases if the entity linking part is removed. Especially on FIGER (GOLD), the strict accuracy drops from 75.5 to 69.8. Using entity linking improves less on BBN. We think this is because of three reasons: 1) BBN has a much smaller tag set than FIGER (GOLD); 2) BBN does not allow a mention to be annotated with multiple type paths (e.g., labeling a mention with both /building and /location is not allowed), thus the task is easier; 3) By making the model deep, the performance on BBN is already improved a lot, which makes further improvement harder.\nThe improvement of our full approach over Ours (DirectTrain) on FIGER (GOLD) indicates that the techniques we use to avoid overfitting the weakly labeled data are also effective.\nOurs (LocAttEL), which uses a more advanced EL system, does not achieve better performance than Ours (Full), which uses our own EL approach. After manually checking the results of the two EL approaches and the predictions of our model on FIGER (GOLD), we think this is mainly because: 1) Our model also uses the context while making predictions. Sometimes, if it \u201cthinks\u201d that the type information provided by EL is incorrect, it may not use it. 2) The performances of different EL approaches also depends on the dataset and the types of entities used for evaluation. We find that on FIGER (GOLD), the approach in BIBREF19 is better at distinguishing locations and sports teams, but it may also make some mistakes that our simple EL method does not. For example, it may incorrectly link \u201cMarch,\u201d the month, to an entity whose Wikipedia description fits the context better. 3) For some mentions, although the EL system links it to an incorrect entity, the type of this entity is the same with the correct entity.\nWe propose a deep neural model to improve fine-grained entity typing with entity linking. The problem of overfitting the weakly labeled training data is addressed by using a variant of the hinge loss and introducing noise during training. We conduct experiments on two commonly used dataset. The experimental results demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach.\nThis paper was supported by the Early Career Scheme (ECS, No. 26206717) from Research Grants Council in Hong Kong and WeChat-HKUST WHAT Lab on Artificial Intelligence Technology.", "question": "How do they obtain the entity linking results in their model?", "expected_output": "They use an EL algorithm that links the mention to the entity with the help of the greatest commonness score..

Each anchor link can be used as a mention. These mentions are labeled by mapping the Freebase types of the target entries to the tag set $T$ BIBREF0.\nSince the KB type representations we use in our FET model are also obtained through mapping Freebase types, they will perfectly match the automatically generated labels for the mentions that are correctly linked (i.e., when the entity returned by the EL algorithm and the target entry of the anchor link are the same). For example, in Figure FIGREF4, suppose the example sentence is a training sample obtained from Wikipedia, where \u201cDonald Trump\u201d is an anchor link points to the Wikipedia page of Donald Trump. After mapping the Freebase types of Donald Trump to the target tag set, this sample will be weakly annotated as /person/politician, /person/tv_personality, and /person/business, which is exactly the same as the type information (the \u201cTypes From KB\u201d in Figure FIGREF4) obtained through EL. Thus, during training, when the EL system links the mention to the correct entity, the model only needs to output the types in the KB type representation. This may cause the trained model to overfit the weakly labeled training data. For most types of entities such as locations and organizations, it is fine since they usually have the same types in different contexts. But it is problematic for person mentions, as their types can be context dependent.\nTo address this problem, during training, if a mention is linked to a person entity by our entity linking algorithm, we add a random fine-grained person type label that does not belong to this entity while generating the KB type representation. For example, if the mention is linked to a person with types /person/actor and /person/author, a random label /person/politician may be added. This will force the model to still infer the type labels from the context even when the mention is correctly linked, since the KB type representation no longer perfectly match the weak labels.\nTo make it more flexible, we also propose to use a variant of the hinge loss used by BIBREF16 to train our model:\nwhere $\\tau _m$ is the correct type set for mention $m$, $\\bar{\\tau }_m$ is the incorrect type set. $\\lambda (t)\\in [1,+\\infty )$ is a predefined parameter to impose a larger penalty if the type $t$ is incorrectly predicted as positive. Since the problem of overfitting the weakly annotated labels is more severe for person mentions, we set $\\lambda (t)=\\lambda _P$ if $t$ is a fine-grained person type, and $\\lambda (t)=1$ for all other types.\nDuring training, we also randomly set the EL results of half of the training samples to be NIL. So that the model can perform well for mentions that cannot be linked to the KB at test time.\nIn this paper, we use a simple EL algorithm that directly links the mention to the entity with the greatest commonness score. Commonness BIBREF17, BIBREF18 is calculated base on the anchor links in Wikipedia. It estimates the probability of an entity given only the mention string. In our FET approach, the commonness score is also used as the confidence on the linking result (i.e., the $\\mathbf {g}$ used in the prediction part of Subsection SECREF5). Within a same document, we also use the same heuristic used in BIBREF19 to find coreferences of generic mentions of persons (e.g., \u201cMatt\u201d) to more specific mentions (e.g., \u201cMatt Damon\u201d).\nWe also tried other more advanced EL methods in our experiments. However, they do not improve the final performance of our model. Experimental results of using the EL system proposed in BIBREF19 is provided in Section SECREF4.\nWe use two datasets: FIGER (GOLD) BIBREF0 and BBN BIBREF5. The sizes of their tag sets are 113 and 47, respectively. FIGER (GOLD) allows mentions to have multiple type paths, but BBN does not. Another commonly used dataset, OntoNotes BIBREF1, is not used since it contains many pronoun and common noun phrase mentions such as \u201cit,\u201d \u201che,\u201d \u201ca thrift institution,\u201d which are not suitable to directly apply entity linking on.\nFollowing BIBREF0, we generate weakly labeled datasets for training with Wikipedia anchor links. Since the tag sets used by FIGER (GOLD) and BBN are different, we create a training set for each of them. For each dataset, $2,000$ weakly labeled samples are randomly picked to form a development set. We also manually annotated 50 person mentions collected from news articles for tuning the parameter $\\lambda _P$.\nWe use the 300 dimensional pretrained GloVe word vectors provided by BIBREF20. The hidden layer sizes of the two layers of BiLSTMs are both set to 250. For the three-layer MLP, the size of the two hidden layers are both set to 500. The size of the type embeddings is 500. $\\lambda _P$ is set to 2.0. We also apply batch normalization and dropout to the input of each dense layer in our three-layer MLP during training.\nWe use strict accuracy, Macro F1, and Micro F1 to evaluate fine-grained typing performance BIBREF0.\nWe compare with the following existing approaches: AFET BIBREF3, AAA BIBREF16, NFETC BIBREF9, and CLSC BIBREF21.\nWe use Ours (Full) to represent our full model, and also compare with five variants of our own approach: Ours (DirectTrain) is trained without adding random person types while obtaining the KB type representation, and $\\lambda _P$ is set to 1; Ours (NoEL) does not use entity linking, i.e., the KB type representation and the entity linking confidence score are removed, and the model is trained in DirectTrain style; Ours (NonDeep) uses one BiLSTM layer and replaces the MLP with a dense layer; Ours (NonDeep NoEL) is the NoEL version of Ours (NonDeep); Ours (LocAttEL) uses the entity linking approach proposed in BIBREF19 instead of our own commonness based approach. Ours (Full), Ours (DirectTrain), and Ours (NonDeep) all use our own commonness based entity linking approach.\nThe experimental results are listed in Table TABREF16. As we can see, our approach performs much better than existing approaches on both datasets.\nThe benefit of using entity linking in our approach can be verified by comparing Ours (Full) and Ours (NoEL). The performance on both datasets decreases if the entity linking part is removed. Especially on FIGER (GOLD), the strict accuracy drops from 75.5 to 69.8. Using entity linking improves less on BBN. We think this is because of three reasons: 1) BBN has a much smaller tag set than FIGER (GOLD); 2) BBN does not allow a mention to be annotated with multiple type paths (e.g., labeling a mention with both /building and /location is not allowed), thus the task is easier; 3) By making the model deep, the performance on BBN is already improved a lot, which makes further improvement harder.\nThe improvement of our full approach over Ours (DirectTrain) on FIGER (GOLD) indicates that the techniques we use to avoid overfitting the weakly labeled data are also effective.\nOurs (LocAttEL), which uses a more advanced EL system, does not achieve better performance than Ours (Full), which uses our own EL approach. After manually checking the results of the two EL approaches and the predictions of our model on FIGER (GOLD), we think this is mainly because: 1) Our model also uses the context while making predictions. Sometimes, if it \u201cthinks\u201d that the type information provided by EL is incorrect, it may not use it. 2) The performances of different EL approaches also depends on the dataset and the types of entities used for evaluation. We find that on FIGER (GOLD), the approach in BIBREF19 is better at distinguishing locations and sports teams, but it may also make some mistakes that our simple EL method does not. For example, it may incorrectly link \u201cMarch,\u201d the month, to an entity whose Wikipedia description fits the context better. 3) For some mentions, although the EL system links it to an incorrect entity, the type of this entity is the same with the correct entity.\nWe propose a deep neural model to improve fine-grained entity typing with entity linking. The problem of overfitting the weakly labeled training data is addressed by using a variant of the hinge loss and introducing noise during training. We conduct experiments on two commonly used dataset. The experimental results demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach.\nThis paper was supported by the Early Career Scheme (ECS, No. 26206717) from Research Grants Council in Hong Kong and WeChat-HKUST WHAT Lab on Artificial Intelligence Technology.", "question": "Which model architecture do they use?", "expected_output": "BiLSTMs. Explanation: Our FET approach is illustrated in Figure FIGREF4.

{"id": "1909.12079", "prompt": "Given a piece of text and the span of an entity mention in this text, fine-grained entity typing (FET) is the task of assigning fine-grained type labels to the mention BIBREF0. The assigned labels should be context dependent BIBREF1. For example, in the sentence \u201cTrump threatens to pull US out of World Trade Organization,\u201d the mention \u201cTrump\u201d should be labeled as /person and /person/politician, although Donald Trump also had other occupations such as businessman, TV personality, etc.\nThis task is challenging because it usually uses a relatively large tag set, and some mentions may require the understanding of the context to be correctly labeled. Moreover, since manual annotation is very labor-intensive, existing approaches have to rely on distant supervision to train models BIBREF0, BIBREF2.\nThus, the use of extra information to help with the classification process becomes very important. In this paper, we improve FET with entity linking (EL). EL is helpful for a model to make typing decisions because if a mention is correctly linked to its target entity, we can directly obtain the type information about this entity in the knowledge base (KB). For example, in the sentence \u201cThere were some great discussions on a variety of issues facing Federal Way,\u201d the mention \u201cFederal Way\u201d may be incorrectly labeled as a company by some FET models. Such a mistake can be avoided after linking it to the city Federal Way, Washington. For cases that require the understanding of the context, using entity linking results is also beneficial. In the aforementioned example where \u201cTrump\u201d is the mention, obtaining all the types of Donald Trump in the knowledge base (e.g., politician, businessman, TV personality, etc.) is still informative for inferring the correct type (i.e., politician) that fits the context, since they narrows the possible labels down.\nHowever, the information obtained through EL should not be fully trusted since it is not always accurate. Even when a mention is correctly linked to an entity, the type information of this entity in the KB may be incomplete or outdated. Thus, in this paper, we propose a deep neural fine-grained entity typing model that flexibly predicts labels based on the context, the mention string, and the type information from KB obtained with EL.\nUsing EL also introduces a new problem for the training process. Currently, a widely used approach to create FET training samples is to use the anchor links in Wikipedia BIBREF0, BIBREF3. Each anchor link is regarded as a mention, and is weakly labeled with all the types of its referred entity (the Wikipedia page the anchor link points to) in KB. Our approach, when links the mention correctly, also uses all the types of the referred entity in KB as extra information. This may cause the trained model to overfit the weakly labeled data. We design a variant of the hinge loss and introduce noise during training to address this problem.\nWe conduct experiments on two commonly used FET datasets. Experimental results show that introducing information obtained through entity linking and having a deep neural model both helps to improve FET performance. Our model achieves more than 5% absolute strict accuracy improvement over the state of the art on both datasets.\nOur contributions are summarized as follows:\nWe propose a deep neural fine-grained entity typing model that utilizes type information from KB obtained through entity linking.\nWe address the problem that our model may overfit the weakly labeled data by using a variant of the hinge-loss and introducing noise during training.\nWe demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach with experimental results on commonly used FET datasets.\nOur code is available at https://github.com/HKUST-KnowComp/IFETEL.\nAn early effort of classifying named entities into fine-grained types can be found in BIBREF4, which only focuses on person names. Latter, datasets with larger type sets are constructed BIBREF5, BIBREF0, BIBREF6. These datasets are more preferred by recent studies BIBREF3, BIBREF7.\nMost of the existing approaches proposed for FET are learning based. The features used by these approaches can either be hand-crafted BIBREF0, BIBREF1 or learned from neural network models BIBREF8, BIBREF9, BIBREF10. Since FET systems usually use distant supervision for training, the labels of the training samples can be noisy, erroneous or overly specific. Several studies BIBREF11, BIBREF12, BIBREF9 address these problems by separating clean mentions and noisy mentions, modeling type correction BIBREF3, using a hierarchy-aware loss BIBREF9, etc.\nBIBREF13 and BIBREF14 are two studies that are most related to this paper. BIBREF13 propose an unsupervised FET system where EL is an importat component. But they use EL to help with clustering and type name selection, which is very different from how we use it to improve the performance of a supervised FET model. BIBREF14 finds related entities based on the context instead of directly applying EL. The types of these entities are then used for inferring the type of the mention.\nLet $T$ be a predefined tag set, which includes all the types we want to assign to mentions. Given a mention $m$ and its context, the task is to predict a set of types $\\mathbf {\\tau }\\subset T$ suitable for this mention. Thus, this is a multi-class, multi-label classification problem BIBREF0. Next, we will introduce our approach for this problem in detail, including the neural model, the training of the model, and the entity linking algorithm we use.\nEach input sample to our FET system contains one mention and the sentence it belongs to. We denote $w_1,w_2,...,w_n$ as the words in the current sentence, $w_{p_1},w_{p_2},...,w_{p_l}$ as the words in the mention string, where $n$ is the number of words in the sentence, $p_1,...,p_l$ are the indices of the words in the mention string, $l$ is the number of words in the mention string. We also use a set of pretrained word embeddings.\nOur FET approach is illustrated in Figure FIGREF4. It first constructs three representations: context representation, mention string representation, and KB type representation. Note that the KB type representation is obtained from a knowledge base through entity linking and is independent of the context of the mention.\nTo obtain the context representation, we first use a special token $w_m$ to represent the mention (the token \u201c[Mention]\u201d in Figure FIGREF4). Then, the word sequence of the sentence becomes $w_1,...,w_{p_l-1},w_m,w_{p_l+1},...,w_n$. Their corresponding word embeddings are fed into two layers of BiLSTMs. Let $\\mathbf {h}_m^1$ and $\\mathbf {h}_m^2$ be the output of the first and the second layer of BiLSTMs for $w_m$, respectively. We use $\\mathbf {f}_c=\\mathbf {h}_m^1+\\mathbf {h}_m^2$ as the context representation vector.\nLet $\\mathbf {x}_1,...,\\mathbf {x}_l$ be the word embeddings of the mention string words $w_{p_1},...,w_{p_l}$. Then the mention string representation $\\mathbf {f}_s=(\\sum _{i=1}^l \\mathbf {x}_i)/l$.\nTo obtain the KB type representation, we run an EL algorithm for the current mention. If the EL algorithm returns an entity, we retrieve the types of of this entity from the KB. We use Freebase as our KB. Since the types in Freebase is different from $T$, the target type set, they are mapped to the types in $T$ with rules similar to those used in BIBREF14. Afterwards, we perform one hot encoding on these types to get the KB Type Representation $\\mathbf {f}_e$. If the EL algorithm returns NIL (i.e., the mention cannot be linked to an entity), we simply one hot encode the empty type set.\nApart from the three representations, we also obtain the score returned by our entity linking algorithm, which indicates its confidence on the linking result. We denote it as a one dimensional vector $\\mathbf {g}$. Then, we get $\\mathbf {f}=\\mathbf {f}_c\\oplus \\mathbf {f}_s\\oplus \\mathbf {f}_e\\oplus \\mathbf {g}$, where $\\oplus $ means concatenation. $\\mathbf {f}$ is then fed into an MLP that contains three dense layers to obtain $\\mathbf {u}_m$, out final representation for the current mention sample $m$. Let $t_1,t_2,...,t_k$ be all the types in $T$, where $k=|T|$. We embed them into the same space as $\\mathbf {u}_m$ by assigning each of them a dense vector BIBREF15. These vectors are denoted as $\\mathbf {t}_1,...,\\mathbf {t}_k$. Then the score of the mention $m$ having the type $t_i\\in T$ is calculated as the dot product of $\\mathbf {u}_m$ and $\\mathbf {t}_i$:\nWe predict $t_i$ as a type of $m$ if $s(m,t_i)>0$.\nFollowing existing studies, we also generate training data by using the anchor links in Wikipedia. Each anchor link can be used as a mention. These mentions are labeled by mapping the Freebase types of the target entries to the tag set $T$ BIBREF0.\nSince the KB type representations we use in our FET model are also obtained through mapping Freebase types, they will perfectly match the automatically generated labels for the mentions that are correctly linked (i.e., when the entity returned by the EL algorithm and the target entry of the anchor link are the same). For example, in Figure FIGREF4, suppose the example sentence is a training sample obtained from Wikipedia, where \u201cDonald Trump\u201d is an anchor link points to the Wikipedia page of Donald Trump. After mapping the Freebase types of Donald Trump to the target tag set, this sample will be weakly annotated as /person/politician, /person/tv_personality, and /person/business, which is exactly the same as the type information (the \u201cTypes From KB\u201d in Figure FIGREF4) obtained through EL. Thus, during training, when the EL system links the mention to the correct entity, the model only needs to output the types in the KB type representation. This may cause the trained model to overfit the weakly labeled training data. For most types of entities such as locations and organizations, it is fine since they usually have the same types in different contexts. But it is problematic for person mentions, as their types can be context dependent.\nTo address this problem, during training, if a mention is linked to a person entity by our entity linking algorithm, we add a random fine-grained person type label that does not belong to this entity while generating the KB type representation. For example, if the mention is linked to a person with types /person/actor and /person/author, a random label /person/politician may be added. This will force the model to still infer the type labels from the context even when the mention is correctly linked, since the KB type representation no longer perfectly match the weak labels.\nTo make it more flexible, we also propose to use a variant of the hinge loss used by BIBREF16 to train our model:\nwhere $\\tau _m$ is the correct type set for mention $m$, $\\bar{\\tau }_m$ is the incorrect type set. $\\lambda (t)\\in [1,+\\infty )$ is a predefined parameter to impose a larger penalty if the type $t$ is incorrectly predicted as positive. Since the problem of overfitting the weakly annotated labels is more severe for person mentions, we set $\\lambda (t)=\\lambda _P$ if $t$ is a fine-grained person type, and $\\lambda (t)=1$ for all other types.\nDuring training, we also randomly set the EL results of half of the training samples to be NIL. So that the model can perform well for mentions that cannot be linked to the KB at test time.\nIn this paper, we use a simple EL algorithm that directly links the mention to the entity with the greatest commonness score. Commonness BIBREF17, BIBREF18 is calculated base on the anchor links in Wikipedia. It estimates the probability of an entity given only the mention string. In our FET approach, the commonness score is also used as the confidence on the linking result (i.e., the $\\mathbf {g}$ used in the prediction part of Subsection SECREF5). Within a same document, we also use the same heuristic used in BIBREF19 to find coreferences of generic mentions of persons (e.g., \u201cMatt\u201d) to more specific mentions (e.g., \u201cMatt Damon\u201d).\nWe also tried other more advanced EL methods in our experiments.

{"id": "2003.11687", "prompt": "The Systems Engineer's Virtual Assistant (SEVA) BIBREF0 was introduced with the goal to assist systems engineers (SE) in their problem-solving abilities by keeping track of large amounts of information of a NASA-specific project and using the information to answer queries from the user. In this work, we address a system element by constructing a common-knowledge concept recognition system for improving the performance of SEVA, using the static knowledge collected from the Systems Engineering Handbook BIBREF1 that is widely used in projects across the organization as domain-specific commonsense knowledge. At NASA, although there exists knowledge engines and ontologies for the SE domain such as MBSE BIBREF2, IMCE BIBREF3, and OpenCaesar BIBREF4, generic commonsense acquisition is rarely discussed; we aim to address this challenge. SE commonsense comes from years of experience and learning which involves background knowledge that goes beyond any handbook. Although constructing an assistant like SEVA system is the overarching objective, a key problem to first address is to extract elementary common-knowledge concepts using the SE handbook and domain experts. We use the term `common-knowledge' as the `commonsense' knowledge of a specific domain. This knowledge can be seen as a pivot that can be used later to collect `commonsense' knowledge for the SE domain. We propose a preliminary research study that can pave a path towards a comprehensive commonsense knowledge acquisition for an effective Artificial Intelligence (AI) application for the SE domain. Overall structure of this work is summarized in Figure 1. Implementation with demo and dataset is available at: https://github.com/jitinkrishnan/NASA-SE .\nCreating commonsense AI still remains an important and challenging task in AI research today. Some of the inspiring works are the CYC project BIBREF5 that tries to serve as a foundational knowledge to all systems with millions of everyday life commonsense assertions, Mosaic Commonsense Knowledge Graphs and Reasoning BIBREF6 that addresses aspects like social situations, mental states, and causal relationships, and Aristo System BIBREF7 that focuses on basic science knowledge. In NASA's context, systems engineering combines several engineering disciplines requiring extreme coordination and is prone to human errors. This, in combination with the lack of efficient knowledge transfer of generic lessons-learned makes most technology-based missions risk-averse. Thus, a comprehensive commonsense engine can significantly enhance the productivity of any mission by letting the experts focus on what they do best.\nConcept Recognition (CR) is a task identical to the traditional Named Entity Recognition (NER) problem. A typical NER task seeks to identify entities like name of a person such as `Shakespeare', a geographical location such as `London', or name of an organisation such as `NASA' from unstructured text. A supervised NER dataset consists of the above mentioned entities annotated at the word-token level using labelling schemes such as BIO which provides beginning (B), continuation or inside (I), and outside (O) representation for each word of an entity. BIBREF8 is the current top-performing NER model for CoNLL-2003 shared task BIBREF9. Off-the-shelf named entity extractors do not suffice in the SE common-knowledge scenario because the entities we want to extract are domain-specific concepts such as `system architecture' or `functional requirements' rather than physical entities such as `Shakespeare' or `London'. This requires defining new labels and fine-tuning.\nRelation extraction tasks extract semantic relationships from text. These extractors aim to connect named entities such as `Shakespeare' and `England' using relations such as `born-in'. Relations can be as simple as using hand-built patterns or as challenging as using unsupervised methods like Open IE BIBREF10; with bootstrapping, supervised, and semi-supervised methods in between. BIBREF11 and BIBREF12 are some of the high performing models that extract relations from New York Times Corpus BIBREF13 and TACRED challenges BIBREF14 respectively. Hyponyms represent hierarchical connection between entities of a domain and represent important relationships. For instance, a well-known work by BIBREF15 uses syntactic patterns such as [Y such as A, B, C], [Y including X], or [Y, including X] to extract hyponyms. Our goal is to extract preliminary hyponym relations from the concepts extracted by the CR and to connect the entities through verb phrases.\nSE concepts are less ambiguous as compared to generic natural language text. A word usually means one concept. For example, the word `system' usually means the same when referring to a `complex system', `system structure', or `management system' in the SE domain. In generic text, the meaning of terms like `evaluation', `requirement', or `analysis' may contextually differ. We would like domain specific phrases such as `system evaluation', `performance requirement', or `system analysis' to be single entities. Based on the operational and system concepts described in BIBREF0, we carefully construct a set of concept-labels for the SE handbook which is shown in the next section.\nabb: represents abbreviations such as TRL representing Technology Readiness Level.\ngrp: represents a group of people or an individual such as Electrical Engineers, Systems Engineers or a Project Manager.\nsyscon: represents any system concepts such as engineering unit, product, hardware, software, etc. They mostly represent physical concepts.\nopcon: represents operational concepts such as decision analysis process, technology maturity assessment, system requirements review, etc.\nseterm: represents generic terms that are frequently used in SE text and those that do not fall under syscon or opcon such as project, mission, key performance parameter, audit etc.\nevent: represents event-like information in SE text such as Pre-Phase A, Phase A, Phase B, etc.\norg: represents an organization such as `NASA', `aerospace industry', etc.\nart: represents names of artifacts or instruments such as `AS1300'\ncardinal: represents numerical values such as `1', `100', 'one' etc.\nloc: represents location-like entities such as component facilities or centralized facility.\nmea: represents measures, features, or behaviors such as cost, risk, or feasibility.\nAbbreviations are used frequently in SE text. We automatically extract abbreviations using simple pattern-matching around parentheses. Given below is a sample regex that matches most abbreviations in the SE handbook.\nr\"\\([ ]*[A-Z][A-Za-z]*[ ]*\\)\"\nAn iterative regex matching procedure using this pattern over the preceding words will produce the full phrase of the abbreviation. `A process to determine a system\u2019s technological maturity based on Technology Readiness Levels (TRLs)' produces the abbreviation TRL which stands for Technology Readiness Levels. `Define one or more initial Concept of Operations (ConOps) scenarios' produces the abbreviation ConOps which stands for Concept of Operations. We pre-label these abbreviations as concept entities. Many of these abbreviations are also provided in the Appendix section of the handbook which is also extracted and used as concepts.\nVarious locations of the handbook and the glossary provide definitions of several SE concepts. We collect these and compile a comprehensive definitions document which is also used for the concept recognition task. An example definition and its description is shown below:\nDefinition: Acceptable Risk\nDescription: The risk that is understood and agreed to by the program/project, governing authority, mission directorate, and other customer(s) such that no further specific mitigating action is required.\nUsing python tools such as PyPDF2, NLTK, and RegEx we build a pipeline to convert PDF to raw text along with extensive pre-processing which includes joining sentences that are split, removing URLs, shortening duplicate non-alpha characters, and replacing full forms of abbreviations with their shortened forms. We assume that the SE text is free of spelling errors. For the CR dataset, we select coherent paragraphs and full sentences by avoiding headers and short blurbs. Using domain keywords and a domain expert, we annotate roughly 3700 sentences at the word-token level. An example is shown in Figure 2 and the unique tag count is shown in Table 1.\nAny language model can be used for the purpose of customizing an NER problem to CR. We choose to go with BERT BIBREF16 because of its general-purpose nature and usage of contextualized word embeddings.\nIn the hand-labelled dataset, each word gets a label. The idea is to perform multi-class classification using BERT's pre-trained cased language model. We use pytorch transformers and hugging face as per the tutorial by BIBREF17 which uses $BertForTokenClassification$. The text is embedded as tokens and masks with a maximum token length. This embedded tokens are provided as the input to the pre-trained BERT model for a full fine-tuning. The model gives an F1-score of $0.89$ for the concept recognition task. An 80-20 data split is used for training and evaluation. Detailed performance of the CR is shown in Table 2 and 3. Additionally, we also implemented CR using spaCy BIBREF18 which also produced similar results.\nIn this work, for relation extraction, we focus on hyponyms and verb phrase chunking. Hyponyms are more specific concepts such as earth to planet or rose to flower. Verb phrase chunking connects the named entities recognized by the CR model through verbs.\nThe definition document consists of 241 SE definitions and their descriptions. We iteratively construct entities in increasing order of number of words in the definitions with the help of their parts-of-speech tags. This helps in creating subset-of relation between a lower-word entity and a higher-word entity. Each root entity is lemmatized such that entities like processes and process appear only once.\nUsing the words (especially nouns) that surround an already identified named entity, more specific entities can be identified. This is performed on a few selected entity tags such as opcon and syscon. For example, consider the sentence `SE functions should be performed'. `SE' has tag NNP and `functions' has tag NNS. We create a relation called subset-of between `SE functions' and `SE'.\nRelations from abbreviations are simple direct connections between the abbreviation and its full form described in the abbreviations dataset. Figure FIGREF25 shows a snippet of knowledge graph constructed using stands-for and subset-of relationships. Larger graphs are shown in the demo.\nFinally, we explore creating contextual triples from sentences using all the entities extracted using the CR model and entities from definitions. Only those phrases that connect two entities are selected for verb phrase extraction. Using NLTK's regex parser and chunker, a grammar such as\nVP: {(<MD>|<R.*>|<I.*>|<VB.*>|<JJ.*>|\n<TO>)*<VB.*>+(<MD>|<R.*>|<I.*>|<VB.*>|\n<JJ.*>|<TO>)*}\nwith at least one verb, can extract relation-like phrases from the phrase that links two concepts. An example is shown in Figure FIGREF27. Further investigation of relation extraction from SE handbook is left as future work.\nWe presented a common-knowledge concept extractor for the Systems Engineer's Virtual Assistant (SEVA) system and showed how it can be beneficial for downstream tasks such as relation extraction and knowledge graph construction. We construct a word-level annotated dataset with the help of a domain expert by carefully defining a labelling scheme to train a sequence labelling task to recognize SE concepts.

{"id": "2003.11687", "prompt": "The Systems Engineer's Virtual Assistant (SEVA) BIBREF0 was introduced with the goal to assist systems engineers (SE) in their problem-solving abilities by keeping track of large amounts of information of a NASA-specific project and using the information to answer queries from the user. In this work, we address a system element by constructing a common-knowledge concept recognition system for improving the performance of SEVA, using the static knowledge collected from the Systems Engineering Handbook BIBREF1 that is widely used in projects across the organization as domain-specific commonsense knowledge. At NASA, although there exists knowledge engines and ontologies for the SE domain such as MBSE BIBREF2, IMCE BIBREF3, and OpenCaesar BIBREF4, generic commonsense acquisition is rarely discussed; we aim to address this challenge. SE commonsense comes from years of experience and learning which involves background knowledge that goes beyond any handbook. Although constructing an assistant like SEVA system is the overarching objective, a key problem to first address is to extract elementary common-knowledge concepts using the SE handbook and domain experts. We use the term `common-knowledge' as the `commonsense' knowledge of a specific domain. This knowledge can be seen as a pivot that can be used later to collect `commonsense' knowledge for the SE domain. We propose a preliminary research study that can pave a path towards a comprehensive commonsense knowledge acquisition for an effective Artificial Intelligence (AI) application for the SE domain. Overall structure of this work is summarized in Figure 1. Implementation with demo and dataset is available at: https://github.com/jitinkrishnan/NASA-SE .\nCreating commonsense AI still remains an important and challenging task in AI research today. Some of the inspiring works are the CYC project BIBREF5 that tries to serve as a foundational knowledge to all systems with millions of everyday life commonsense assertions, Mosaic Commonsense Knowledge Graphs and Reasoning BIBREF6 that addresses aspects like social situations, mental states, and causal relationships, and Aristo System BIBREF7 that focuses on basic science knowledge. In NASA's context, systems engineering combines several engineering disciplines requiring extreme coordination and is prone to human errors. This, in combination with the lack of efficient knowledge transfer of generic lessons-learned makes most technology-based missions risk-averse. Thus, a comprehensive commonsense engine can significantly enhance the productivity of any mission by letting the experts focus on what they do best.\nConcept Recognition (CR) is a task identical to the traditional Named Entity Recognition (NER) problem. A typical NER task seeks to identify entities like name of a person such as `Shakespeare', a geographical location such as `London', or name of an organisation such as `NASA' from unstructured text. A supervised NER dataset consists of the above mentioned entities annotated at the word-token level using labelling schemes such as BIO which provides beginning (B), continuation or inside (I), and outside (O) representation for each word of an entity. BIBREF8 is the current top-performing NER model for CoNLL-2003 shared task BIBREF9. Off-the-shelf named entity extractors do not suffice in the SE common-knowledge scenario because the entities we want to extract are domain-specific concepts such as `system architecture' or `functional requirements' rather than physical entities such as `Shakespeare' or `London'. This requires defining new labels and fine-tuning.\nRelation extraction tasks extract semantic relationships from text. These extractors aim to connect named entities such as `Shakespeare' and `England' using relations such as `born-in'. Relations can be as simple as using hand-built patterns or as challenging as using unsupervised methods like Open IE BIBREF10; with bootstrapping, supervised, and semi-supervised methods in between. BIBREF11 and BIBREF12 are some of the high performing models that extract relations from New York Times Corpus BIBREF13 and TACRED challenges BIBREF14 respectively. Hyponyms represent hierarchical connection between entities of a domain and represent important relationships. For instance, a well-known work by BIBREF15 uses syntactic patterns such as [Y such as A, B, C], [Y including X], or [Y, including X] to extract hyponyms. Our goal is to extract preliminary hyponym relations from the concepts extracted by the CR and to connect the entities through verb phrases.\nSE concepts are less ambiguous as compared to generic natural language text. A word usually means one concept. For example, the word `system' usually means the same when referring to a `complex system', `system structure', or `management system' in the SE domain. In generic text, the meaning of terms like `evaluation', `requirement', or `analysis' may contextually differ.

Relations can be as simple as using hand-built patterns or as challenging as using unsupervised methods like Open IE BIBREF10; with bootstrapping, supervised, and semi-supervised methods in between. BIBREF11 and BIBREF12 are some of the high performing models that extract relations from New York Times Corpus BIBREF13 and TACRED challenges BIBREF14 respectively. Hyponyms represent hierarchical connection between entities of a domain and represent important relationships. For instance, a well-known work by BIBREF15 uses syntactic patterns such as [Y such as A, B, C], [Y including X], or [Y, including X] to extract hyponyms. Our goal is to extract preliminary hyponym relations from the concepts extracted by the CR and to connect the entities through verb phrases.\nSE concepts are less ambiguous as compared to generic natural language text. A word usually means one concept. For example, the word `system' usually means the same when referring to a `complex system', `system structure', or `management system' in the SE domain. In generic text, the meaning of terms like `evaluation', `requirement', or `analysis' may contextually differ. We would like domain specific phrases such as `system evaluation', `performance requirement', or `system analysis' to be single entities. Based on the operational and system concepts described in BIBREF0, we carefully construct a set of concept-labels for the SE handbook which is shown in the next section.\nabb: represents abbreviations such as TRL representing Technology Readiness Level.\ngrp: represents a group of people or an individual such as Electrical Engineers, Systems Engineers or a Project Manager.\nsyscon: represents any system concepts such as engineering unit, product, hardware, software, etc. They mostly represent physical concepts.\nopcon: represents operational concepts such as decision analysis process, technology maturity assessment, system requirements review, etc.\nseterm: represents generic terms that are frequently used in SE text and those that do not fall under syscon or opcon such as project, mission, key performance parameter, audit etc.\nevent: represents event-like information in SE text such as Pre-Phase A, Phase A, Phase B, etc.\norg: represents an organization such as `NASA', `aerospace industry', etc.\nart: represents names of artifacts or instruments such as `AS1300'\ncardinal: represents numerical values such as `1', `100', 'one' etc.\nloc: represents location-like entities such as component facilities or centralized facility.\nmea: represents measures, features, or behaviors such as cost, risk, or feasibility.\nAbbreviations are used frequently in SE text. We automatically extract abbreviations using simple pattern-matching around parentheses. Given below is a sample regex that matches most abbreviations in the SE handbook.\nr\"\\([ ]*[A-Z][A-Za-z]*[ ]*\\)\"\nAn iterative regex matching procedure using this pattern over the preceding words will produce the full phrase of the abbreviation. `A process to determine a system\u2019s technological maturity based on Technology Readiness Levels (TRLs)' produces the abbreviation TRL which stands for Technology Readiness Levels. `Define one or more initial Concept of Operations (ConOps) scenarios' produces the abbreviation ConOps which stands for Concept of Operations. We pre-label these abbreviations as concept entities. Many of these abbreviations are also provided in the Appendix section of the handbook which is also extracted and used as concepts.\nVarious locations of the handbook and the glossary provide definitions of several SE concepts. We collect these and compile a comprehensive definitions document which is also used for the concept recognition task. An example definition and its description is shown below:\nDefinition: Acceptable Risk\nDescription: The risk that is understood and agreed to by the program/project, governing authority, mission directorate, and other customer(s) such that no further specific mitigating action is required.\nUsing python tools such as PyPDF2, NLTK, and RegEx we build a pipeline to convert PDF to raw text along with extensive pre-processing which includes joining sentences that are split, removing URLs, shortening duplicate non-alpha characters, and replacing full forms of abbreviations with their shortened forms. We assume that the SE text is free of spelling errors. For the CR dataset, we select coherent paragraphs and full sentences by avoiding headers and short blurbs. Using domain keywords and a domain expert, we annotate roughly 3700 sentences at the word-token level. An example is shown in Figure 2 and the unique tag count is shown in Table 1.\nAny language model can be used for the purpose of customizing an NER problem to CR. We choose to go with BERT BIBREF16 because of its general-purpose nature and usage of contextualized word embeddings.\nIn the hand-labelled dataset, each word gets a label. The idea is to perform multi-class classification using BERT's pre-trained cased language model. We use pytorch transformers and hugging face as per the tutorial by BIBREF17 which uses $BertForTokenClassification$. The text is embedded as tokens and masks with a maximum token length. This embedded tokens are provided as the input to the pre-trained BERT model for a full fine-tuning. The model gives an F1-score of $0.89$ for the concept recognition task. An 80-20 data split is used for training and evaluation. Detailed performance of the CR is shown in Table 2 and 3. Additionally, we also implemented CR using spaCy BIBREF18 which also produced similar results.\nIn this work, for relation extraction, we focus on hyponyms and verb phrase chunking. Hyponyms are more specific concepts such as earth to planet or rose to flower. Verb phrase chunking connects the named entities recognized by the CR model through verbs.\nThe definition document consists of 241 SE definitions and their descriptions. We iteratively construct entities in increasing order of number of words in the definitions with the help of their parts-of-speech tags. This helps in creating subset-of relation between a lower-word entity and a higher-word entity. Each root entity is lemmatized such that entities like processes and process appear only once.\nUsing the words (especially nouns) that surround an already identified named entity, more specific entities can be identified. This is performed on a few selected entity tags such as opcon and syscon. For example, consider the sentence `SE functions should be performed'. `SE' has tag NNP and `functions' has tag NNS. We create a relation called subset-of between `SE functions' and `SE'.\nRelations from abbreviations are simple direct connections between the abbreviation and its full form described in the abbreviations dataset. Figure FIGREF25 shows a snippet of knowledge graph constructed using stands-for and subset-of relationships. Larger graphs are shown in the demo.\nFinally, we explore creating contextual triples from sentences using all the entities extracted using the CR model and entities from definitions. Only those phrases that connect two entities are selected for verb phrase extraction. Using NLTK's regex parser and chunker, a grammar such as\nVP: {(<MD>|<R.*>|<I.*>|<VB.*>|<JJ.*>|\n<TO>)*<VB.*>+(<MD>|<R.*>|<I.*>|<VB.*>|\n<JJ.*>|<TO>)*}\nwith at least one verb, can extract relation-like phrases from the phrase that links two concepts. An example is shown in Figure FIGREF27. Further investigation of relation extraction from SE handbook is left as future work.\nWe presented a common-knowledge concept extractor for the Systems Engineer's Virtual Assistant (SEVA) system and showed how it can be beneficial for downstream tasks such as relation extraction and knowledge graph construction. We construct a word-level annotated dataset with the help of a domain expert by carefully defining a labelling scheme to train a sequence labelling task to recognize SE concepts. Further, we also construct some essential datasets from the SE domain which can be used for future research.

{"id": "2003.11687", "prompt": "The Systems Engineer's Virtual Assistant (SEVA) BIBREF0 was introduced with the goal to assist systems engineers (SE) in their problem-solving abilities by keeping track of large amounts of information of a NASA-specific project and using the information to answer queries from the user. In this work, we address a system element by constructing a common-knowledge concept recognition system for improving the performance of SEVA, using the static knowledge collected from the Systems Engineering Handbook BIBREF1 that is widely used in projects across the organization as domain-specific commonsense knowledge. At NASA, although there exists knowledge engines and ontologies for the SE domain such as MBSE BIBREF2, IMCE BIBREF3, and OpenCaesar BIBREF4, generic commonsense acquisition is rarely discussed; we aim to address this challenge. SE commonsense comes from years of experience and learning which involves background knowledge that goes beyond any handbook. Although constructing an assistant like SEVA system is the overarching objective, a key problem to first address is to extract elementary common-knowledge concepts using the SE handbook and domain experts. We use the term `common-knowledge' as the `commonsense' knowledge of a specific domain. This knowledge can be seen as a pivot that can be used later to collect `commonsense' knowledge for the SE domain. We propose a preliminary research study that can pave a path towards a comprehensive commonsense knowledge acquisition for an effective Artificial Intelligence (AI) application for the SE domain. Overall structure of this work is summarized in Figure 1. Implementation with demo and dataset is available at: https://github.com/jitinkrishnan/NASA-SE .\nCreating commonsense AI still remains an important and challenging task in AI research today. Some of the inspiring works are the CYC project BIBREF5 that tries to serve as a foundational knowledge to all systems with millions of everyday life commonsense assertions, Mosaic Commonsense Knowledge Graphs and Reasoning BIBREF6 that addresses aspects like social situations, mental states, and causal relationships, and Aristo System BIBREF7 that focuses on basic science knowledge. In NASA's context, systems engineering combines several engineering disciplines requiring extreme coordination and is prone to human errors. This, in combination with the lack of efficient knowledge transfer of generic lessons-learned makes most technology-based missions risk-averse. Thus, a comprehensive commonsense engine can significantly enhance the productivity of any mission by letting the experts focus on what they do best.\nConcept Recognition (CR) is a task identical to the traditional Named Entity Recognition (NER) problem. A typical NER task seeks to identify entities like name of a person such as `Shakespeare', a geographical location such as `London', or name of an organisation such as `NASA' from unstructured text. A supervised NER dataset consists of the above mentioned entities annotated at the word-token level using labelling schemes such as BIO which provides beginning (B), continuation or inside (I), and outside (O) representation for each word of an entity. BIBREF8 is the current top-performing NER model for CoNLL-2003 shared task BIBREF9. Off-the-shelf named entity extractors do not suffice in the SE common-knowledge scenario because the entities we want to extract are domain-specific concepts such as `system architecture' or `functional requirements' rather than physical entities such as `Shakespeare' or `London'. This requires defining new labels and fine-tuning.\nRelation extraction tasks extract semantic relationships from text. These extractors aim to connect named entities such as `Shakespeare' and `England' using relations such as `born-in'.

{"id": "1703.10152", "prompt": "One of the crucial tasks for researchers to carry out scientific investigations is to detect existing ideas that are related to their research topics. Research ideas are usually documented in scientific publications. Normally, there is one main idea stated in the abstract, explicitly presenting the aim of the paper. There are also other sub-ideas distributed across the entire paper. As the growth rate of scientific publication has been rising dramatically, researchers are overwhelmed by the explosive information. It is almost impossible to digest the ideas contained in the documents emerged everyday. Therefore, computer assisted technologies such as document summarization are expected to play a role in condensing information and providing readers with more relevant short texts. Unlike document summarization from news circles, where the task is to identify centroid sentences BIBREF0 or to extract the first few sentences of the paragraphs BIBREF1 , summarization of scientific articles involves extra text processing stage BIBREF2 . After highest ranked texts are extracted, rhetorical status analysis will be conducted on the selected sentences. Rhetorical sentence classification, also known as argumentative zoning (AZ) BIBREF3 , is a process of assigning rhetorical status to the extracted sentences. The results of AZ provide readers with general discourse context from which the scientific ideas could be better linked, compared and analyzed. For example, given a specific task, which sentences should be shown to the reader is related to the features of the sentences. For the task of identifying a paper's unique contribution, sentences expressing research purpose should be retrieved with higher priority. For comparing ideas, statements of comparison with other works would be more useful. Teufel et. al. BIBREF2 introduced their rhetorical annotation scheme which takes into account of the aspects of argumentation, metadiscourse and relatedness to other works. Their scheme resulted seven categories of rhetorical status and the categories are assigned to full sentences. Examples of human annotated sentences with their rhetorical status are shown in Table. TABREF2 . The seven categories are aim, contrast, own, background, other, basis and textual.\nAnalyzing the rhetorical status of sentences manually requires huge amount of efforts, especially for structuring information from multiple documents. Fortunately, computer algorithms have been introduced to solve this problem. With the development of artificial intelligence, machine learning and computational linguistics, Natural Language Processing (NLP) has become a popular research area BIBREF4 , BIBREF5 . NLP covers the applications from document retrieval, text categorization BIBREF6 , document summarization BIBREF7 to sentiment analysis BIBREF8 , BIBREF9 . Those applications are targeting different types of text resources, such as articles from social media BIBREF10 and scientific publications BIBREF2 . There are several approaches to tackle these tasks. From machine learning prospective, text can be analysed via supervised BIBREF2 , semi-supervised BIBREF11 and unsupervised BIBREF12 algorithms.\nDocument summarization from social media and news circles has received much attention for the past decades. Those problems have been addressed from many angles, one of which is feature extraction and representation. At the early stage of document summarization, features are usually engineered manually. Although the hand-crafted features have shown the ability for document summarization and sentiment analysis BIBREF13 , BIBREF9 , there are not enough efficient features to capture the semantic relations between words, phrases and sentences. Moreover, building a sufficient pool of features manually is difficult, because it requires expert knowledge and it is time-consuming. Teufel et. al. BIBREF2 have built feature pool of sixteen types of features to classify sentences, such as the position of sentence, sentence length and tense. Widyantoro et. al. used content features, qualifying adjectives and meta-discourse features BIBREF14 to explore AZ task. It took efforts to engineer these features and it is also time consuming to optimize the combination of the entire features. With the advent of neural networks BIBREF15 , it is possible for computers to learn feature representations automatically. Recently, word embedding technique BIBREF16 has been widely used in the NLP community. There are plenty of cases where word embedding and sentence representations have been applied to short text classification BIBREF17 and paraphrase detection BIBREF18 . However, the effectiveness of this technique on AZ needs further study. The research question is, is it possible to extract word embeddings as features to classify sentences into the seven categories mentioned above using supervised machine learning approach?\nThe tool of word2vec proposed by Mikolov et al. BIBREF16 has gained a lot attention recently. With word2vec tool, word embeddings can be learnt from big amount of text corpus and the semantic relationships between words can be measured by the cosine distances between the vectors. The idea behind word embeddings is to use distributed representation BIBREF19 to map each word into k-dimension vector. How these vectors are generated using word2vec tool? The common method to derive the vectors is using neural probabilistic language model BIBREF20 . The underlying word representations for each word are obtained while training the language model. Similar to the mechanism in language model, Mikolov et al. BIBREF16 introduced two architectures: Skip-gram model and continuous bag of words (CBOW) model. Each of the model has two different training strategies, such as hierarchical softmax and negative sampling. Both these two models have three layers: input, projection and output layer. The word vectors are obtained once the models are optimized. Usually, this optimizing process is done using stochastic gradient descent method. It doesn't need labels when training the models, which makes word2vec algorithm more valuable compared with traditional supervised machine learning methods that require a big amount of annotated data. Given enough text corpus, the word2vec can generate meaningful representations.\nWord2vec has been applied to sentiment analysis BIBREF21 , BIBREF22 , BIBREF23 and text classification BIBREF24 . Sadeghian and Sharafat BIBREF25 explored averaging of the word vectors in a sentiment review statement. Their results indicated that word2vec models significantly outperform the vanilla bag-of-words model. Amongst the word2vec based models, softmax provides the best form of classification. Tang et al. BIBREF21 used the concatenation of vectors derived from different convolutional layers to analyze the sentiment statements. They also trained sentiment-specific word embeddings to improve the twitter sentiment classification results. This work is aiming at learning word embeddings for the task of AZ. The results were compared from three aspects: the impact of the training corpus, the effectiveness of specific word embeddings and different ways of constructing sentence representations based on the learned word vectors.\nLe and Mikolov BIBREF26 introduced the concept of word vector representation in a formal way:\nGiven a sequence of training words INLINEFORM0 , the objective of the word2vec model is to maximize the average log probability:\n INLINEFORM0 INLINEFORM1 INLINEFORM2 p INLINEFORM3 (1)\nUsing softmax technique, the prediction can be formalized as:\np INLINEFORM0 = INLINEFORM1 (2)\nEach of INLINEFORM0 is un-normalized log probability for each output word INLINEFORM1 :\n INLINEFORM0 (3)\nIn this study, sentence embeddings were learned from large text corpus as features to classify sentences into seven categories in the task of AZ. Three models were explored to obtain the sentence vectors: averaging the vectors of the words in one sentence, paragraph vectors and specific word vectors.\nThe first model, averaging word vectors ( INLINEFORM0 ), is to average the vectors in word sequence INLINEFORM1 . The main process in this model is to learn the word embedding matrix INLINEFORM2 :\n INLINEFORM0 INLINEFORM1 INLINEFORM2 INLINEFORM3 (4)\nwhere INLINEFORM0 is the word embedding for word INLINEFORM1 , which is learned by the classical word2vec algorithm BIBREF16 .\nThe second model, INLINEFORM0 , is aiming at training paragraph vectors. It is also called distributed memory model of paragraph vectors (PV-DM) BIBREF26 , which is an extension of word2vec. In comparison with the word2vec framework, the only change in PV-DM is in the equation (3), where INLINEFORM1 is constructed from INLINEFORM2 and INLINEFORM3 , where matrix INLINEFORM4 is the word vector and INLINEFORM5 holds the paragraph vectors in such a way that every paragraph is mapped to a unique vector represented by a column in matrix INLINEFORM6 .\nThe third model is constructed for the purpose of improving classification results for a certain category. In this study specifically, the optimization task was focused on identifying the category INLINEFORM0 . In this study, INLINEFORM1 specific word embeddings were trained ( INLINEFORM2 ) inspired by Tang et al. BIBREF21 's model: Sentiment-Specific Word Embedding (unified model: INLINEFORM3 ). After obtaining the word vectors via INLINEFORM4 , the same scheme was used to average the vectors in one sentence as in the model INLINEFORM5 .\nThe learned word embeddings are input into a classifier as features under a supervised machine learning framework. Similar to sentiment classification using word embeddings BIBREF21 , where they try to predict each tweet to be either positive or negative, in the task of AZ, the embeddings are used to classify each sentence into one of the seven categories.\nTo evaluate the classification performance, precision, recall and F-measure were computed.\n INLINEFORM0 collection. ACL Anthology Reference Corpus contains the canonical 10,921 computational linguistics papers, from which 622,144 sentences were generated after filtering out sentences with lower quality.\n INLINEFORM0 collection contains 6,778 sentences, extracted from the titles and abstracts of publications provided by WEB OF SCIENCE .\nArgumentative Zoning Corpus ( INLINEFORM0 corpus) consists of 80 AZ INLINEFORM1 annotated conference articles in computational linguistics, originally drawn from the Cmplg arXiv. . After Concatenating sub-sentences, 7,347 labeled sentences were obtained.\nTo compare the three models effectiveness on the AZ task, the three models on a same ACL dataset (introduced int he dataset section) were trained. The word2vec were also trained using different parameters, such as different dimension of features. To evaluate the impact from different domains, the first model was trained on different corpus.\nThe characteristics of word embeddings based on different model and dataset are listed in Table. TABREF12 .\nInspired by the work from Sadeghian and Sharafat BIBREF25 , the word to vector features were set up as follows: the Minimum word count is 40; The number of threads to run in parallel is 4 and the context window is 10.\nIn imbalanced data sets, some classes are significantly outnumbered by other classes BIBREF27 , which affects the classification results. In this experiment, the test dataset is an imbalanced data set. Table. TABREF16 shows the distribution of rhetorical categories from the INLINEFORM0 test dataset. The categories OWN and OTH are significantly outnumbering other categories.\nTo deal with the problem of classification on unbalanced data, synthetic Minority Over-sampling TEchnique (SMOTE) BIBREF28 were performed on the original dataset. 10-cross validation scheme was adopted and the results were averaged from 10 iterations.\nTable. TABREF19 and TABREF20 show the classification performance of different methods. \nThe results were examined from the following aspects:\nWhen the feature dimension is set to 100 and the training corpus is ACL, the results generated by different models were compared (AVGWVEC,\nPARAVEC and AVGWVEC+BSWE for BAS category only). Looking at the F-measure, AVGWVEC performs better than PARAVEC, but PARAVEC gave a better precision results on several categories, such as AIM, CTR, TXT and OWN. The results showed that PARAVEC model is not robust, for example, it performs badly for the category of BAS. For specific category classification, take the BAS category for example, the BSWE model outperforms others in terms of F-measure.\nWhen the model is fixed to AVGWVEC and the training corpus is ACL, the feature size impact (300 and 100 dimensions) was investigated. From the F-measure, it can be seen that for some categories, 300-dimension features perform better than the 100-dimension ones, for example, CTR and BKG, but they are not as good as 100-dimension features for some categories, such as BAS.\nWhen the model is set to AVGWVEC and the feature dimension is 100, the results computed from different training corpus were compared (ACL+AZ, MixedAbs and Brown corpus). ACL+AZ outperforms others and brown corpus is better than MixedAbs for most of the categories, but brown corpus is not as good as MixedAbs for the category of OWN.\nFinally, the results were compared between word embeddings and the methods of cuewords, Teufel 2002 and baseline. To evaluate word embeddings on AZ, the model AVGWVEC trained on ACL+AZ was used for the comparison. It can be seen from the table. TABREF19 , the model of word embeddings is better than the method using cuewords matching. It also outperforms Teufel 2002 for most of the cases, except AIM, BAS and OWN. It won baseline for most of the categories, except OWN.\nThe classification results showed that the type of word embeddings and the training corpus affect the AZ performance. As the simple model, INLINEFORM0 performs better than others, which indicate averaging the word vectors in a sentence can capture the semantic property of statements. By training specific argumentation word embeddings, the performance can be improved, which can be seen from the case of detecting BAS status using INLINEFORM1 model.\nFeature dimension doesn't dominate the results. There is no significant difference between the resutls generated by 300-dimension of features and 100 dimensions.\nTraining corpus affects the results. ACL+AZ outperforming others indicates that the topics of the training corpus are important factors in argumentative zoning. Although Brown corpus has more vocabularies, it doesn't win ACL+AZ.\nIn general, the classification performance of word embeddings is competitive in terms of F-measure for most of the categories. But for classifying the categories AIM, BAS and OWN, the manually crafted features proposed by Teufel et al. BIBREF2 gave better results.\nIn this paper, different word embedding models on the task of argumentative zoning were compared . The results showed that word embeddings are effective on sentence classification from scientific papers. Word embeddings trained on a relevant corpus can capture the semantic features of statements and they are easier to be obtained than hand engineered features.\nTo improve the sentence classification for a specific category, integrating word specific embedding strategy helps. The size of the feature pool doesn't matter too much on the results, nor does the vocabulary size.

Given enough text corpus, the word2vec can generate meaningful representations.\nWord2vec has been applied to sentiment analysis BIBREF21 , BIBREF22 , BIBREF23 and text classification BIBREF24 . Sadeghian and Sharafat BIBREF25 explored averaging of the word vectors in a sentiment review statement. Their results indicated that word2vec models significantly outperform the vanilla bag-of-words model. Amongst the word2vec based models, softmax provides the best form of classification. Tang et al. BIBREF21 used the concatenation of vectors derived from different convolutional layers to analyze the sentiment statements. They also trained sentiment-specific word embeddings to improve the twitter sentiment classification results. This work is aiming at learning word embeddings for the task of AZ. The results were compared from three aspects: the impact of the training corpus, the effectiveness of specific word embeddings and different ways of constructing sentence representations based on the learned word vectors.\nLe and Mikolov BIBREF26 introduced the concept of word vector representation in a formal way:\nGiven a sequence of training words INLINEFORM0 , the objective of the word2vec model is to maximize the average log probability:\n INLINEFORM0 INLINEFORM1 INLINEFORM2 p INLINEFORM3 (1)\nUsing softmax technique, the prediction can be formalized as:\np INLINEFORM0 = INLINEFORM1 (2)\nEach of INLINEFORM0 is un-normalized log probability for each output word INLINEFORM1 :\n INLINEFORM0 (3)\nIn this study, sentence embeddings were learned from large text corpus as features to classify sentences into seven categories in the task of AZ. Three models were explored to obtain the sentence vectors: averaging the vectors of the words in one sentence, paragraph vectors and specific word vectors.\nThe first model, averaging word vectors ( INLINEFORM0 ), is to average the vectors in word sequence INLINEFORM1 . The main process in this model is to learn the word embedding matrix INLINEFORM2 :\n INLINEFORM0 INLINEFORM1 INLINEFORM2 INLINEFORM3 (4)\nwhere INLINEFORM0 is the word embedding for word INLINEFORM1 , which is learned by the classical word2vec algorithm BIBREF16 .\nThe second model, INLINEFORM0 , is aiming at training paragraph vectors. It is also called distributed memory model of paragraph vectors (PV-DM) BIBREF26 , which is an extension of word2vec. In comparison with the word2vec framework, the only change in PV-DM is in the equation (3), where INLINEFORM1 is constructed from INLINEFORM2 and INLINEFORM3 , where matrix INLINEFORM4 is the word vector and INLINEFORM5 holds the paragraph vectors in such a way that every paragraph is mapped to a unique vector represented by a column in matrix INLINEFORM6 .\nThe third model is constructed for the purpose of improving classification results for a certain category. In this study specifically, the optimization task was focused on identifying the category INLINEFORM0 . In this study, INLINEFORM1 specific word embeddings were trained ( INLINEFORM2 ) inspired by Tang et al. BIBREF21 's model: Sentiment-Specific Word Embedding (unified model: INLINEFORM3 ). After obtaining the word vectors via INLINEFORM4 , the same scheme was used to average the vectors in one sentence as in the model INLINEFORM5 .\nThe learned word embeddings are input into a classifier as features under a supervised machine learning framework. Similar to sentiment classification using word embeddings BIBREF21 , where they try to predict each tweet to be either positive or negative, in the task of AZ, the embeddings are used to classify each sentence into one of the seven categories.\nTo evaluate the classification performance, precision, recall and F-measure were computed.\n INLINEFORM0 collection. ACL Anthology Reference Corpus contains the canonical 10,921 computational linguistics papers, from which 622,144 sentences were generated after filtering out sentences with lower quality.\n INLINEFORM0 collection contains 6,778 sentences, extracted from the titles and abstracts of publications provided by WEB OF SCIENCE .\nArgumentative Zoning Corpus ( INLINEFORM0 corpus) consists of 80 AZ INLINEFORM1 annotated conference articles in computational linguistics, originally drawn from the Cmplg arXiv. . After Concatenating sub-sentences, 7,347 labeled sentences were obtained.\nTo compare the three models effectiveness on the AZ task, the three models on a same ACL dataset (introduced int he dataset section) were trained. The word2vec were also trained using different parameters, such as different dimension of features. To evaluate the impact from different domains, the first model was trained on different corpus.\nThe characteristics of word embeddings based on different model and dataset are listed in Table. TABREF12 .\nInspired by the work from Sadeghian and Sharafat BIBREF25 , the word to vector features were set up as follows: the Minimum word count is 40; The number of threads to run in parallel is 4 and the context window is 10.\nIn imbalanced data sets, some classes are significantly outnumbered by other classes BIBREF27 , which affects the classification results. In this experiment, the test dataset is an imbalanced data set. Table. TABREF16 shows the distribution of rhetorical categories from the INLINEFORM0 test dataset. The categories OWN and OTH are significantly outnumbering other categories.\nTo deal with the problem of classification on unbalanced data, synthetic Minority Over-sampling TEchnique (SMOTE) BIBREF28 were performed on the original dataset. 10-cross validation scheme was adopted and the results were averaged from 10 iterations.\nTable. TABREF19 and TABREF20 show the classification performance of different methods. \nThe results were examined from the following aspects:\nWhen the feature dimension is set to 100 and the training corpus is ACL, the results generated by different models were compared (AVGWVEC,\nPARAVEC and AVGWVEC+BSWE for BAS category only). Looking at the F-measure, AVGWVEC performs better than PARAVEC, but PARAVEC gave a better precision results on several categories, such as AIM, CTR, TXT and OWN. The results showed that PARAVEC model is not robust, for example, it performs badly for the category of BAS. For specific category classification, take the BAS category for example, the BSWE model outperforms others in terms of F-measure.\nWhen the model is fixed to AVGWVEC and the training corpus is ACL, the feature size impact (300 and 100 dimensions) was investigated. From the F-measure, it can be seen that for some categories, 300-dimension features perform better than the 100-dimension ones, for example, CTR and BKG, but they are not as good as 100-dimension features for some categories, such as BAS.\nWhen the model is set to AVGWVEC and the feature dimension is 100, the results computed from different training corpus were compared (ACL+AZ, MixedAbs and Brown corpus). ACL+AZ outperforms others and brown corpus is better than MixedAbs for most of the categories, but brown corpus is not as good as MixedAbs for the category of OWN.\nFinally, the results were compared between word embeddings and the methods of cuewords, Teufel 2002 and baseline. To evaluate word embeddings on AZ, the model AVGWVEC trained on ACL+AZ was used for the comparison. It can be seen from the table. TABREF19 , the model of word embeddings is better than the method using cuewords matching. It also outperforms Teufel 2002 for most of the cases, except AIM, BAS and OWN. It won baseline for most of the categories, except OWN.\nThe classification results showed that the type of word embeddings and the training corpus affect the AZ performance. As the simple model, INLINEFORM0 performs better than others, which indicate averaging the word vectors in a sentence can capture the semantic property of statements. By training specific argumentation word embeddings, the performance can be improved, which can be seen from the case of detecting BAS status using INLINEFORM1 model.\nFeature dimension doesn't dominate the results. There is no significant difference between the resutls generated by 300-dimension of features and 100 dimensions.\nTraining corpus affects the results. ACL+AZ outperforming others indicates that the topics of the training corpus are important factors in argumentative zoning. Although Brown corpus has more vocabularies, it doesn't win ACL+AZ.\nIn general, the classification performance of word embeddings is competitive in terms of F-measure for most of the categories. But for classifying the categories AIM, BAS and OWN, the manually crafted features proposed by Teufel et al. BIBREF2 gave better results.\nIn this paper, different word embedding models on the task of argumentative zoning were compared . The results showed that word embeddings are effective on sentence classification from scientific papers. Word embeddings trained on a relevant corpus can capture the semantic features of statements and they are easier to be obtained than hand engineered features.\nTo improve the sentence classification for a specific category, integrating word specific embedding strategy helps. The size of the feature pool doesn't matter too much on the results, nor does the vocabulary size.

{"id": "1703.10152", "prompt": "One of the crucial tasks for researchers to carry out scientific investigations is to detect existing ideas that are related to their research topics. Research ideas are usually documented in scientific publications. Normally, there is one main idea stated in the abstract, explicitly presenting the aim of the paper. There are also other sub-ideas distributed across the entire paper. As the growth rate of scientific publication has been rising dramatically, researchers are overwhelmed by the explosive information. It is almost impossible to digest the ideas contained in the documents emerged everyday. Therefore, computer assisted technologies such as document summarization are expected to play a role in condensing information and providing readers with more relevant short texts. Unlike document summarization from news circles, where the task is to identify centroid sentences BIBREF0 or to extract the first few sentences of the paragraphs BIBREF1 , summarization of scientific articles involves extra text processing stage BIBREF2 . After highest ranked texts are extracted, rhetorical status analysis will be conducted on the selected sentences. Rhetorical sentence classification, also known as argumentative zoning (AZ) BIBREF3 , is a process of assigning rhetorical status to the extracted sentences. The results of AZ provide readers with general discourse context from which the scientific ideas could be better linked, compared and analyzed. For example, given a specific task, which sentences should be shown to the reader is related to the features of the sentences. For the task of identifying a paper's unique contribution, sentences expressing research purpose should be retrieved with higher priority. For comparing ideas, statements of comparison with other works would be more useful. Teufel et. al. BIBREF2 introduced their rhetorical annotation scheme which takes into account of the aspects of argumentation, metadiscourse and relatedness to other works. Their scheme resulted seven categories of rhetorical status and the categories are assigned to full sentences. Examples of human annotated sentences with their rhetorical status are shown in Table. TABREF2 . The seven categories are aim, contrast, own, background, other, basis and textual.\nAnalyzing the rhetorical status of sentences manually requires huge amount of efforts, especially for structuring information from multiple documents. Fortunately, computer algorithms have been introduced to solve this problem. With the development of artificial intelligence, machine learning and computational linguistics, Natural Language Processing (NLP) has become a popular research area BIBREF4 , BIBREF5 . NLP covers the applications from document retrieval, text categorization BIBREF6 , document summarization BIBREF7 to sentiment analysis BIBREF8 , BIBREF9 . Those applications are targeting different types of text resources, such as articles from social media BIBREF10 and scientific publications BIBREF2 . There are several approaches to tackle these tasks. From machine learning prospective, text can be analysed via supervised BIBREF2 , semi-supervised BIBREF11 and unsupervised BIBREF12 algorithms.\nDocument summarization from social media and news circles has received much attention for the past decades. Those problems have been addressed from many angles, one of which is feature extraction and representation. At the early stage of document summarization, features are usually engineered manually. Although the hand-crafted features have shown the ability for document summarization and sentiment analysis BIBREF13 , BIBREF9 , there are not enough efficient features to capture the semantic relations between words, phrases and sentences. Moreover, building a sufficient pool of features manually is difficult, because it requires expert knowledge and it is time-consuming. Teufel et. al. BIBREF2 have built feature pool of sixteen types of features to classify sentences, such as the position of sentence, sentence length and tense. Widyantoro et. al. used content features, qualifying adjectives and meta-discourse features BIBREF14 to explore AZ task. It took efforts to engineer these features and it is also time consuming to optimize the combination of the entire features. With the advent of neural networks BIBREF15 , it is possible for computers to learn feature representations automatically. Recently, word embedding technique BIBREF16 has been widely used in the NLP community. There are plenty of cases where word embedding and sentence representations have been applied to short text classification BIBREF17 and paraphrase detection BIBREF18 . However, the effectiveness of this technique on AZ needs further study. The research question is, is it possible to extract word embeddings as features to classify sentences into the seven categories mentioned above using supervised machine learning approach?\nThe tool of word2vec proposed by Mikolov et al. BIBREF16 has gained a lot attention recently. With word2vec tool, word embeddings can be learnt from big amount of text corpus and the semantic relationships between words can be measured by the cosine distances between the vectors. The idea behind word embeddings is to use distributed representation BIBREF19 to map each word into k-dimension vector. How these vectors are generated using word2vec tool? The common method to derive the vectors is using neural probabilistic language model BIBREF20 . The underlying word representations for each word are obtained while training the language model. Similar to the mechanism in language model, Mikolov et al. BIBREF16 introduced two architectures: Skip-gram model and continuous bag of words (CBOW) model. Each of the model has two different training strategies, such as hierarchical softmax and negative sampling. Both these two models have three layers: input, projection and output layer.

After Concatenating sub-sentences, 7,347 labeled sentences were obtained.\nTo compare the three models effectiveness on the AZ task, the three models on a same ACL dataset (introduced int he dataset section) were trained. The word2vec were also trained using different parameters, such as different dimension of features. To evaluate the impact from different domains, the first model was trained on different corpus.\nThe characteristics of word embeddings based on different model and dataset are listed in Table. TABREF12 .\nInspired by the work from Sadeghian and Sharafat BIBREF25 , the word to vector features were set up as follows: the Minimum word count is 40; The number of threads to run in parallel is 4 and the context window is 10.\nIn imbalanced data sets, some classes are significantly outnumbered by other classes BIBREF27 , which affects the classification results. In this experiment, the test dataset is an imbalanced data set. Table. TABREF16 shows the distribution of rhetorical categories from the INLINEFORM0 test dataset. The categories OWN and OTH are significantly outnumbering other categories.\nTo deal with the problem of classification on unbalanced data, synthetic Minority Over-sampling TEchnique (SMOTE) BIBREF28 were performed on the original dataset. 10-cross validation scheme was adopted and the results were averaged from 10 iterations.\nTable. TABREF19 and TABREF20 show the classification performance of different methods. \nThe results were examined from the following aspects:\nWhen the feature dimension is set to 100 and the training corpus is ACL, the results generated by different models were compared (AVGWVEC,\nPARAVEC and AVGWVEC+BSWE for BAS category only). Looking at the F-measure, AVGWVEC performs better than PARAVEC, but PARAVEC gave a better precision results on several categories, such as AIM, CTR, TXT and OWN. The results showed that PARAVEC model is not robust, for example, it performs badly for the category of BAS. For specific category classification, take the BAS category for example, the BSWE model outperforms others in terms of F-measure.\nWhen the model is fixed to AVGWVEC and the training corpus is ACL, the feature size impact (300 and 100 dimensions) was investigated. From the F-measure, it can be seen that for some categories, 300-dimension features perform better than the 100-dimension ones, for example, CTR and BKG, but they are not as good as 100-dimension features for some categories, such as BAS.\nWhen the model is set to AVGWVEC and the feature dimension is 100, the results computed from different training corpus were compared (ACL+AZ, MixedAbs and Brown corpus). ACL+AZ outperforms others and brown corpus is better than MixedAbs for most of the categories, but brown corpus is not as good as MixedAbs for the category of OWN.\nFinally, the results were compared between word embeddings and the methods of cuewords, Teufel 2002 and baseline. To evaluate word embeddings on AZ, the model AVGWVEC trained on ACL+AZ was used for the comparison. It can be seen from the table. TABREF19 , the model of word embeddings is better than the method using cuewords matching. It also outperforms Teufel 2002 for most of the cases, except AIM, BAS and OWN. It won baseline for most of the categories, except OWN.\nThe classification results showed that the type of word embeddings and the training corpus affect the AZ performance. As the simple model, INLINEFORM0 performs better than others, which indicate averaging the word vectors in a sentence can capture the semantic property of statements. By training specific argumentation word embeddings, the performance can be improved, which can be seen from the case of detecting BAS status using INLINEFORM1 model.\nFeature dimension doesn't dominate the results. There is no significant difference between the resutls generated by 300-dimension of features and 100 dimensions.\nTraining corpus affects the results. ACL+AZ outperforming others indicates that the topics of the training corpus are important factors in argumentative zoning. Although Brown corpus has more vocabularies, it doesn't win ACL+AZ.\nIn general, the classification performance of word embeddings is competitive in terms of F-measure for most of the categories. But for classifying the categories AIM, BAS and OWN, the manually crafted features proposed by Teufel et al. BIBREF2 gave better results.\nIn this paper, different word embedding models on the task of argumentative zoning were compared . The results showed that word embeddings are effective on sentence classification from scientific papers. Word embeddings trained on a relevant corpus can capture the semantic features of statements and they are easier to be obtained than hand engineered features.\nTo improve the sentence classification for a specific category, integrating word specific embedding strategy helps. The size of the feature pool doesn't matter too much on the results, nor does the vocabulary size. In comparison, the domain of the training corpus affects the classification performance.", "question": "What is argumentative zoning?", "expected_output": "Rhetorical sentence classification, also known as argumentative zoning (AZ) BIBREF3 , is a process of assigning rhetorical status to the extracted sentences.

{"id": "1907.04072", "prompt": "Twitter is an important medium for people and companies to promote their products, ideologies, or to reach out and connect with other people in the form of micro-conversations. Twitter provides users with multiple ways of showing their support towards a tweet in the form of Likes, Retweets and Quotes. These content-level appraisals help in spreading the content further and act as a measure of users' agreement on the value of the content. The count of these content-level appraisals therefore determines the influence of a particular tweet and its author. This has led to the creation of certain blackmarket services such as FreeFollowers (https://www.freefollowers.io/), Like4Like (https://like4like.org/), YouLikeHits (https://www.youlikehits.com/), JustRetweet (http://justretweet.com), which allow users to post their tweets in order to gain inorganic appraisals in the form of Likes, Retweets and Quotes BIBREF0 , BIBREF1 .\nThere has been a lot of research on the detection of fraudulent activities on Twitter such as detection of bots BIBREF2 , fake followers BIBREF3 , collusive retweeters BIBREF0 , BIBREF1 , and social spam BIBREF4 . However, the problem of detecting tweets that are posted to these blackmarket services has not been tackled before. The tweets submitted to blackmarket services are not necessarily spam or promotional tweets. As we observe in our data, there is some intersection between spammers and blackmarket users since spammers may also try to gain more appraisals by using these services. However, existing spam tweet detection approaches do not work that well in identifying individual tweets as blackmarket tweets (as shown in Table TABREF29 ).\nTable TABREF1 shows a sample tweet that was posted on a blackmarket service and another sample tweet that was not. In this paper, we make the first attempt to detect tweets that are posted on blackmarket services. Our aim is to build a system that can flag tweets soon after they are posted, which is why we do not consider temporal features such as the number of retweets or likes that a tweet keeps gaining over time. Instead, we only rely on the features and representations extracted from the content of the tweets.\nWe curate a novel dataset of tweets that have been posted to blackmarket services, and a corresponding set of tweets that haven't. We propose a multitask learning approach to combine properties from the characterization of blackmarket tweets via traditional feature extraction, with a deep learning based feature representation of the tweets. We train a neural network which takes as input both the traditional feature representation as well as the deep learning based representation generated using the Tweet2Vec model BIBREF5 , and utilizes cross-stitch units BIBREF6 to learn an optimal combination of shared and task-specific knowledge via soft parameter sharing.\nWe show that our multitask learning approach outperforms Twitter spam detection approaches, as well as state-of-the-art classifiers by 14.1% (in terms of F1-score), achieving an F1-score of 0.89 on our dataset. In short, the contributions of the paper are threefold: a new dataset, characterization of blackmarket tweets, and a novel multitask learning framework to detect tweets posted on blackmarket services.\nSeveral studies have focused on detecting malicious activities such as spam, fake content and blackmarket services. Here, we mention some of these studies which we deem as pertinent to our work. We also mention the prior usage of multitask learning in a similar context.\nSpam/Fake Tweet Detection: The problem of fake and spam tweets is not new. Many solutions have been proposed to tackle this problem. Yardi et al. BIBREF7 showed that the network structure of spammers and non-spammers is different, and also tracked the life cycle of endogenous Twitter content. Chen et al. BIBREF8 conducted a comprehensive evaluation of several machine learning algorithms for timely detection of spam. Fake tweets, on the other hand, are the tweets which spread misinformation. Serrano et al. BIBREF9 provided an extensive survey on fake tweet detection. Unlike spam tweets, fake tweets are mostly associated with major events, and the accounts that produce these fake contents are mostly created during these events BIBREF10 , BIBREF11 .\nBlackmarket Services: Blackmarket services have recently received considerable attention due to the increase in the number of users using them. Analysis of such underground services was first documented in BIBREF12 where the authors examined the properties of social networks formed for blackmarket services. Liu et al. BIBREF13 proposed DetectVC which incorporates graph structure and the prior knowledge from the collusive followers to solve a voluntary following problem. Motoyama et al. BIBREF12 provided a detailed analysis of six underground forms, examining the properties of those social network structures that are formed and services that are being exchanged. Dutta et al. BIBREF0 investigated the customers involved in gaining fake retweets. Chetan et al. BIBREF1 proposed CoReRank, an unsupervised model and CoReRank+, a semi-supervised model which extends CoReRank to detect collusive users involved in retweeting activities.\nMultitask Learning: Multitask learning is used whenever we have two or more similar tasks to optimise together. Most of the related studies on multitask learning are based on how the tasks can be better learned together. Zhang et al. BIBREF14 classified multitask learning models into five types and reported the characteristics of each approach. Cross-Stitch units were introduced by Misra et al. BIBREF6 , which can learn an optimal combination of shared and task-specific representations. Gupta et al. BIBREF15 proposed GIRNet, a unified position-sensitive multitask recurrent neural network architecture.\nblackAs studied in BIBREF0 , there are two prevalent models of blackmarket services, namely premium and freemium. Premium services are only available upon payment from customers, whereas freemium services offer both paid and unpaid options. The unpaid services are available to the users when they contribute to the blackmarket by providing appraisals for other users' content. Here, we mainly concentrate on freemium services. The freemium services can be further divided into three categories: (i) social-share services (request customers to spread the content on social media), (ii) credit-based services (customers earn credits by providing appraisals, and can then use the credits earned to gain appraisals for their content), and (iii) auto-time retweet services (customers need to provide their Twitter access tokens, upon which their content is retweeted 10-20 times for each 15-minute window).\nWe collected data from Credit-based Freemium services because their service model is easy to understand. We crawled two blackmarket sites \u2013 YouLikeHits and Like4Like, between the period of February and April 2019. We created dummy accounts (after careful IRB approval) on these sites to participate in the platform and recorded Tweet IDs of the tweets that were posted for gaining retweets. We used Twitter's REST API to collect the tweet objects of these tweets. The timelines of the authors of these tweets were also collected, allowing us to find genuine tweets by the same users that have not been posted to these blackmarket sites.\nIn total, we collected INLINEFORM0 tweets posted on blackmarket sites. Out of these, we removed non-English tweets and tweets with a length of less than two characters. Finally, we were left with INLINEFORM1 blackmarket tweets. Then, from the timelines of the authors of these tweets, we randomly sampled INLINEFORM2 genuine tweets that were not posted on these blackmarket sites during the same period. Both the blackmarket and genuine tweets were also inspected manually.\nTo further understand the purpose of the collusive users behind the usage of blackmarket services, we annotated blackmarket tweets in our test set into a few discrete categories. The statistics of the categories are as follows: Promotional - 43.75%, Entertainment - 15.89%, Spam - 13.57%, News - 7.86%, Politics - 4.82%, and Others - 14.11%. We considered a tweet as Promotional only if the tweet attempts to promote a website/product. Most of the tweets in the Others category include personal tweets without any call to action or promotion, but this also can be considered as self-promotion. We further noticed that there were about 5% of normal tweets on concerning issues such as \u201cpray for ...\", indicating that blackmarket services are also being used for non-business purposes. 99% of tweets other than the tweets from Others class included at least one URL, and 100% of the URLs in the blackmarket tweets were shortened.\nThis section describes the features and tweet representation methodology, and the proposed model to solve the problem.\nWe use the following features based on the tweet content:\n INLINEFORM0 : Number of user mentions in the tweet\n INLINEFORM0 : Number of hashtags in the tweet\n INLINEFORM0 : Number of URLs in the tweet\n INLINEFORM0 : Count of media content in the tweet\n INLINEFORM0 : Is the tweet a reply to another tweet?\n INLINEFORM0 : Number of special characters (non alpha-numeric) in the tweet\n INLINEFORM0 : Length of the content (number of characters) in the tweet\n INLINEFORM0 : Sentiment score of the tweet obtained using SentiWordNet, ranging from -1 (negative) to +1 (positive)\n INLINEFORM0 : Number of noun words in the tweet\n INLINEFORM0 : Number of adjective words in the tweet\n INLINEFORM0 : Number of pronoun words in the tweet\n INLINEFORM0 : Number of verbs in the tweet\nWe use the Tweet2Vec model BIBREF5 to generate a vector-space representation of each of the tweets. Tweet2Vec is a character-level deep learning based encoder for social media posts trained on the task of predicting the associated hashtags. It considers the assumption that posts with the same hashtags should have similar representation. It uses a bi-directional Gated Recurrent Unit (Bi-GRU) for learning the tweet representation. To get the representation for a particular tweet, the model combines the final GRU states by going through a forward and backward pass over the entire sequence.\nWe use the pre-trained model provided by Dhingra et al. BIBREF5 , which is trained on a dataset of 2 million tweets, to get the tweet representation. This gives us a 500-dimensional representation of each tweet, based on its content.\nThe architecture of our model is shown in Figure FIGREF21 . We adopt multitask learning to develop our model. The primary task is set as a binary classification problem, wherein the tweets are classified as blackmarket or genuine. The secondary task is set as a regression problem, wherein the number of likes and retweets that a tweet will gain after five days of being posted is predicted.\nThe model takes a different input feature vector for each of the tasks.\nPrimary Input: The primary task takes as input the tweet content representation generated by the Tweet2Vec model, which is a 500-dimensional vector for each of the tweets, as described above.\nSecondary Input: The secondary task takes as input the vector of tweet content features, which is a 12-dimensional vector, as described above.\nAs shown in Figure FIGREF21 , the inputs are fed into separate fully connected (FC) layers with cross-stitch units stacked between successive layers. The cross-stitch units find the best shared representations using linear combinations, and learn the optimal linear combinations for a given set of tasks. The cross-stitch units essentially allow us to unify two separate networks for two separate tasks into a single network wherein each layer of the network shares the parameters from the other network using linear combinations. The network also employs batch-normalization and dropout to avoid overfitting.\nThe output layer of the first task classifies tweets as blackmarket or genuine using a cross entropy loss function. The output layer of the second task predicts the numerical values for the number of retweets and likes that a tweet will gain after five days of being posted by using a Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss. Note that the performance of the secondary task is not of importance to us, however, the secondary task helps the primary task. Therefore, we focus on the performance of the model in the primary task during training and evaluation.\nSince there is no prior work on blackmarket tweet detection, we chose state-of-the-art Twitter spam detection methods as baselines, along with training some state-of-the-art classifiers on the features we generated for our dataset.\nSpam Detection 1: We use the Twitter spam detection method proposed by Wu et al. BIBREF4 . It uses the Word2Vec and Doc2Vec models to encode the tweets into a vector representation, which is fed to a MLP classifier in order to classify the tweets as spam or not-spam. We use the same methodology to classify tweets in our dataset as blackmarket or genuine.\nSpam Detection 2: For baseline 2, we consider the approach proposed by Rajdev et. al. BIBREF11 . They proposed flat and hierarchical classifications approaches with few of the standard set of features which can classify spam, fake and legitimate tweets. We use their experimental setup with Random Forest classifier on our dataset.\nWe generate a combined feature vector by concatenating the tweet content features and the encoding generated by Tweet2Vec. This feature vector is then fed to state-of-the-art machine learning classifiers - Random Forest (RF), Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP), and Support Vector Machine (SVM).\nWe consider the problem as a binary classification problem, where the tweets are classified into two classes - blackmarket and genuine. The performance of each competing method is measured using the following metrics: Precision, Recall, and F1-score. The primary output of the multitask learning model gives us the classification result, which is what we use to evaluate our model. All hyperparameters of the models are appropriately tuned. The average results are reported after 5-fold cross-validation.\nAs shown in Table TABREF29 , we observe that the multitask learning based model which uses the Tweet2Vec encoding and the content features as inputs to two separate tasks outperforms all the baselines, achieving an F1-score of 0.89 for classification of tweets as Blackmarket or Genuine. The best baseline is Spam Detector 2 which achieves an F1-score of 0.77.\nblackWe analyse the false negatives generated by our model to find which type of tweets the model finds difficult to classify. The percentage of each class in the false negatives is as follows: Promotional - 23.29%, Politics - 10.96%, Entertainment - 21.92%, News - 9.59%, Spam - 5.48%, and Others - 28.77%. We observe that the tweets belonging to the category Others are difficult to classify since they are similar to genuine tweets in terms of content. The results also indicate that our model is robust while classifying blackmarket tweets belonging to the following categories \u2013 News, Spam and Politics.\nIn this paper, we presented a novel multitask learning approach to solve the problem of identification of tweets that are submitted to blackmarket services, without the use of any temporal features. To sum up, our contributions are three-fold: (i) Characterization: We proposed 12 tweet content based features that are useful in the task of identifying blackmarket tweets, (ii) Classification: We developed a novel Multitask Learning based model to classify tweets as blackmarket tweets or genuine tweets, (iii) Dataset: We collected a dataset consisting of tweets that have been submitted to blackmarket services in order to gain inorganic appraisals.\nThe work was partially funded by DST (ECR/2017/00l691, DST/INT/UK/P158/2017), Ramanujan Fellowship, and the Infosys Centre of AI, IIIT-Delhi, India.", "question": "How did they obtain the tweets?", "expected_output": "crawled two blackmarket sites.

BIBREF4 . It uses the Word2Vec and Doc2Vec models to encode the tweets into a vector representation, which is fed to a MLP classifier in order to classify the tweets as spam or not-spam. We use the same methodology to classify tweets in our dataset as blackmarket or genuine.\nSpam Detection 2: For baseline 2, we consider the approach proposed by Rajdev et. al. BIBREF11 . They proposed flat and hierarchical classifications approaches with few of the standard set of features which can classify spam, fake and legitimate tweets. We use their experimental setup with Random Forest classifier on our dataset.\nWe generate a combined feature vector by concatenating the tweet content features and the encoding generated by Tweet2Vec. This feature vector is then fed to state-of-the-art machine learning classifiers - Random Forest (RF), Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP), and Support Vector Machine (SVM).\nWe consider the problem as a binary classification problem, where the tweets are classified into two classes - blackmarket and genuine. The performance of each competing method is measured using the following metrics: Precision, Recall, and F1-score. The primary output of the multitask learning model gives us the classification result, which is what we use to evaluate our model. All hyperparameters of the models are appropriately tuned. The average results are reported after 5-fold cross-validation.\nAs shown in Table TABREF29 , we observe that the multitask learning based model which uses the Tweet2Vec encoding and the content features as inputs to two separate tasks outperforms all the baselines, achieving an F1-score of 0.89 for classification of tweets as Blackmarket or Genuine. The best baseline is Spam Detector 2 which achieves an F1-score of 0.77.\nblackWe analyse the false negatives generated by our model to find which type of tweets the model finds difficult to classify. The percentage of each class in the false negatives is as follows: Promotional - 23.29%, Politics - 10.96%, Entertainment - 21.92%, News - 9.59%, Spam - 5.48%, and Others - 28.77%. We observe that the tweets belonging to the category Others are difficult to classify since they are similar to genuine tweets in terms of content. The results also indicate that our model is robust while classifying blackmarket tweets belonging to the following categories \u2013 News, Spam and Politics.\nIn this paper, we presented a novel multitask learning approach to solve the problem of identification of tweets that are submitted to blackmarket services, without the use of any temporal features. To sum up, our contributions are three-fold: (i) Characterization: We proposed 12 tweet content based features that are useful in the task of identifying blackmarket tweets, (ii) Classification: We developed a novel Multitask Learning based model to classify tweets as blackmarket tweets or genuine tweets, (iii) Dataset: We collected a dataset consisting of tweets that have been submitted to blackmarket services in order to gain inorganic appraisals.\nThe work was partially funded by DST (ECR/2017/00l691, DST/INT/UK/P158/2017), Ramanujan Fellowship, and the Infosys Centre of AI, IIIT-Delhi, India.", "question": "What baseline do they compare to?", "expected_output": "spam detection method proposed by Wu et al.

{"id": "1907.04072", "prompt": "Twitter is an important medium for people and companies to promote their products, ideologies, or to reach out and connect with other people in the form of micro-conversations. Twitter provides users with multiple ways of showing their support towards a tweet in the form of Likes, Retweets and Quotes. These content-level appraisals help in spreading the content further and act as a measure of users' agreement on the value of the content. The count of these content-level appraisals therefore determines the influence of a particular tweet and its author. This has led to the creation of certain blackmarket services such as FreeFollowers (https://www.freefollowers.io/), Like4Like (https://like4like.org/), YouLikeHits (https://www.youlikehits.com/), JustRetweet (http://justretweet.com), which allow users to post their tweets in order to gain inorganic appraisals in the form of Likes, Retweets and Quotes BIBREF0 , BIBREF1 .\nThere has been a lot of research on the detection of fraudulent activities on Twitter such as detection of bots BIBREF2 , fake followers BIBREF3 , collusive retweeters BIBREF0 , BIBREF1 , and social spam BIBREF4 . However, the problem of detecting tweets that are posted to these blackmarket services has not been tackled before. The tweets submitted to blackmarket services are not necessarily spam or promotional tweets. As we observe in our data, there is some intersection between spammers and blackmarket users since spammers may also try to gain more appraisals by using these services. However, existing spam tweet detection approaches do not work that well in identifying individual tweets as blackmarket tweets (as shown in Table TABREF29 ).\nTable TABREF1 shows a sample tweet that was posted on a blackmarket service and another sample tweet that was not. In this paper, we make the first attempt to detect tweets that are posted on blackmarket services. Our aim is to build a system that can flag tweets soon after they are posted, which is why we do not consider temporal features such as the number of retweets or likes that a tweet keeps gaining over time. Instead, we only rely on the features and representations extracted from the content of the tweets.\nWe curate a novel dataset of tweets that have been posted to blackmarket services, and a corresponding set of tweets that haven't. We propose a multitask learning approach to combine properties from the characterization of blackmarket tweets via traditional feature extraction, with a deep learning based feature representation of the tweets. We train a neural network which takes as input both the traditional feature representation as well as the deep learning based representation generated using the Tweet2Vec model BIBREF5 , and utilizes cross-stitch units BIBREF6 to learn an optimal combination of shared and task-specific knowledge via soft parameter sharing.\nWe show that our multitask learning approach outperforms Twitter spam detection approaches, as well as state-of-the-art classifiers by 14.1% (in terms of F1-score), achieving an F1-score of 0.89 on our dataset. In short, the contributions of the paper are threefold: a new dataset, characterization of blackmarket tweets, and a novel multitask learning framework to detect tweets posted on blackmarket services.\nSeveral studies have focused on detecting malicious activities such as spam, fake content and blackmarket services. Here, we mention some of these studies which we deem as pertinent to our work. We also mention the prior usage of multitask learning in a similar context.\nSpam/Fake Tweet Detection: The problem of fake and spam tweets is not new. Many solutions have been proposed to tackle this problem. Yardi et al. BIBREF7 showed that the network structure of spammers and non-spammers is different, and also tracked the life cycle of endogenous Twitter content. Chen et al. BIBREF8 conducted a comprehensive evaluation of several machine learning algorithms for timely detection of spam. Fake tweets, on the other hand, are the tweets which spread misinformation. Serrano et al. BIBREF9 provided an extensive survey on fake tweet detection. Unlike spam tweets, fake tweets are mostly associated with major events, and the accounts that produce these fake contents are mostly created during these events BIBREF10 , BIBREF11 .\nBlackmarket Services: Blackmarket services have recently received considerable attention due to the increase in the number of users using them. Analysis of such underground services was first documented in BIBREF12 where the authors examined the properties of social networks formed for blackmarket services. Liu et al. BIBREF13 proposed DetectVC which incorporates graph structure and the prior knowledge from the collusive followers to solve a voluntary following problem. Motoyama et al. BIBREF12 provided a detailed analysis of six underground forms, examining the properties of those social network structures that are formed and services that are being exchanged. Dutta et al. BIBREF0 investigated the customers involved in gaining fake retweets. Chetan et al. BIBREF1 proposed CoReRank, an unsupervised model and CoReRank+, a semi-supervised model which extends CoReRank to detect collusive users involved in retweeting activities.\nMultitask Learning: Multitask learning is used whenever we have two or more similar tasks to optimise together. Most of the related studies on multitask learning are based on how the tasks can be better learned together. Zhang et al. BIBREF14 classified multitask learning models into five types and reported the characteristics of each approach. Cross-Stitch units were introduced by Misra et al. BIBREF6 , which can learn an optimal combination of shared and task-specific representations. Gupta et al. BIBREF15 proposed GIRNet, a unified position-sensitive multitask recurrent neural network architecture.\nblackAs studied in BIBREF0 , there are two prevalent models of blackmarket services, namely premium and freemium. Premium services are only available upon payment from customers, whereas freemium services offer both paid and unpaid options. The unpaid services are available to the users when they contribute to the blackmarket by providing appraisals for other users' content. Here, we mainly concentrate on freemium services. The freemium services can be further divided into three categories: (i) social-share services (request customers to spread the content on social media), (ii) credit-based services (customers earn credits by providing appraisals, and can then use the credits earned to gain appraisals for their content), and (iii) auto-time retweet services (customers need to provide their Twitter access tokens, upon which their content is retweeted 10-20 times for each 15-minute window).\nWe collected data from Credit-based Freemium services because their service model is easy to understand. We crawled two blackmarket sites \u2013 YouLikeHits and Like4Like, between the period of February and April 2019. We created dummy accounts (after careful IRB approval) on these sites to participate in the platform and recorded Tweet IDs of the tweets that were posted for gaining retweets. We used Twitter's REST API to collect the tweet objects of these tweets. The timelines of the authors of these tweets were also collected, allowing us to find genuine tweets by the same users that have not been posted to these blackmarket sites.\nIn total, we collected INLINEFORM0 tweets posted on blackmarket sites. Out of these, we removed non-English tweets and tweets with a length of less than two characters. Finally, we were left with INLINEFORM1 blackmarket tweets. Then, from the timelines of the authors of these tweets, we randomly sampled INLINEFORM2 genuine tweets that were not posted on these blackmarket sites during the same period. Both the blackmarket and genuine tweets were also inspected manually.\nTo further understand the purpose of the collusive users behind the usage of blackmarket services, we annotated blackmarket tweets in our test set into a few discrete categories. The statistics of the categories are as follows: Promotional - 43.75%, Entertainment - 15.89%, Spam - 13.57%, News - 7.86%, Politics - 4.82%, and Others - 14.11%. We considered a tweet as Promotional only if the tweet attempts to promote a website/product. Most of the tweets in the Others category include personal tweets without any call to action or promotion, but this also can be considered as self-promotion. We further noticed that there were about 5% of normal tweets on concerning issues such as \u201cpray for ...\", indicating that blackmarket services are also being used for non-business purposes. 99% of tweets other than the tweets from Others class included at least one URL, and 100% of the URLs in the blackmarket tweets were shortened.\nThis section describes the features and tweet representation methodology, and the proposed model to solve the problem.\nWe use the following features based on the tweet content:\n INLINEFORM0 : Number of user mentions in the tweet\n INLINEFORM0 : Number of hashtags in the tweet\n INLINEFORM0 : Number of URLs in the tweet\n INLINEFORM0 : Count of media content in the tweet\n INLINEFORM0 : Is the tweet a reply to another tweet?\n INLINEFORM0 : Number of special characters (non alpha-numeric) in the tweet\n INLINEFORM0 : Length of the content (number of characters) in the tweet\n INLINEFORM0 : Sentiment score of the tweet obtained using SentiWordNet, ranging from -1 (negative) to +1 (positive)\n INLINEFORM0 : Number of noun words in the tweet\n INLINEFORM0 : Number of adjective words in the tweet\n INLINEFORM0 : Number of pronoun words in the tweet\n INLINEFORM0 : Number of verbs in the tweet\nWe use the Tweet2Vec model BIBREF5 to generate a vector-space representation of each of the tweets. Tweet2Vec is a character-level deep learning based encoder for social media posts trained on the task of predicting the associated hashtags. It considers the assumption that posts with the same hashtags should have similar representation. It uses a bi-directional Gated Recurrent Unit (Bi-GRU) for learning the tweet representation. To get the representation for a particular tweet, the model combines the final GRU states by going through a forward and backward pass over the entire sequence.\nWe use the pre-trained model provided by Dhingra et al. BIBREF5 , which is trained on a dataset of 2 million tweets, to get the tweet representation. This gives us a 500-dimensional representation of each tweet, based on its content.\nThe architecture of our model is shown in Figure FIGREF21 . We adopt multitask learning to develop our model. The primary task is set as a binary classification problem, wherein the tweets are classified as blackmarket or genuine. The secondary task is set as a regression problem, wherein the number of likes and retweets that a tweet will gain after five days of being posted is predicted.\nThe model takes a different input feature vector for each of the tasks.\nPrimary Input: The primary task takes as input the tweet content representation generated by the Tweet2Vec model, which is a 500-dimensional vector for each of the tweets, as described above.\nSecondary Input: The secondary task takes as input the vector of tweet content features, which is a 12-dimensional vector, as described above.\nAs shown in Figure FIGREF21 , the inputs are fed into separate fully connected (FC) layers with cross-stitch units stacked between successive layers. The cross-stitch units find the best shared representations using linear combinations, and learn the optimal linear combinations for a given set of tasks. The cross-stitch units essentially allow us to unify two separate networks for two separate tasks into a single network wherein each layer of the network shares the parameters from the other network using linear combinations. The network also employs batch-normalization and dropout to avoid overfitting.\nThe output layer of the first task classifies tweets as blackmarket or genuine using a cross entropy loss function. The output layer of the second task predicts the numerical values for the number of retweets and likes that a tweet will gain after five days of being posted by using a Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss. Note that the performance of the secondary task is not of importance to us, however, the secondary task helps the primary task. Therefore, we focus on the performance of the model in the primary task during training and evaluation.\nSince there is no prior work on blackmarket tweet detection, we chose state-of-the-art Twitter spam detection methods as baselines, along with training some state-of-the-art classifiers on the features we generated for our dataset.\nSpam Detection 1: We use the Twitter spam detection method proposed by Wu et al.

The primary output of the multitask learning model gives us the classification result, which is what we use to evaluate our model. All hyperparameters of the models are appropriately tuned. The average results are reported after 5-fold cross-validation.\nAs shown in Table TABREF29 , we observe that the multitask learning based model which uses the Tweet2Vec encoding and the content features as inputs to two separate tasks outperforms all the baselines, achieving an F1-score of 0.89 for classification of tweets as Blackmarket or Genuine. The best baseline is Spam Detector 2 which achieves an F1-score of 0.77.\nblackWe analyse the false negatives generated by our model to find which type of tweets the model finds difficult to classify. The percentage of each class in the false negatives is as follows: Promotional - 23.29%, Politics - 10.96%, Entertainment - 21.92%, News - 9.59%, Spam - 5.48%, and Others - 28.77%. We observe that the tweets belonging to the category Others are difficult to classify since they are similar to genuine tweets in terms of content. The results also indicate that our model is robust while classifying blackmarket tweets belonging to the following categories \u2013 News, Spam and Politics.\nIn this paper, we presented a novel multitask learning approach to solve the problem of identification of tweets that are submitted to blackmarket services, without the use of any temporal features. To sum up, our contributions are three-fold: (i) Characterization: We proposed 12 tweet content based features that are useful in the task of identifying blackmarket tweets, (ii) Classification: We developed a novel Multitask Learning based model to classify tweets as blackmarket tweets or genuine tweets, (iii) Dataset: We collected a dataset consisting of tweets that have been submitted to blackmarket services in order to gain inorganic appraisals.\nThe work was partially funded by DST (ECR/2017/00l691, DST/INT/UK/P158/2017), Ramanujan Fellowship, and the Infosys Centre of AI, IIIT-Delhi, India.", "question": "What blackmarket services do they look at?", "expected_output": "Credit-based Freemium services.

{"id": "1909.10481", "prompt": "Learning natural language generation (NLG) models heavily relies on annotated training data. However, most available datasets are collected in a single language (typically English), which restricts deploying the applications to other languages. In this work, we aim at transferring the supervision of a monolingual NLG dataset to unseen languages, so that we can boost performance for the low-resource settings.\nVarious methods have been proposed over the years to learn universal cross-lingual word embeddings BIBREF0, BIBREF1, BIBREF2 or sentence encoders BIBREF3, BIBREF4, BIBREF5, which tries to encode multilingual texts into a single shared vector space. Despite achieving promising results on cross-lingual classification problems, cross-lingual pre-trained models purposed for NLG tasks remains relatively understudied.\nThe cross-lingual generation problem is challenging due to the following reasons. First, it requires the models to understand multilingual input texts, and generate multilingual target sequences. So both encoder and decoder should be pre-trained together. Second, the many-to-many nature of cross-lingual NLG increases language pairs with the square of the number of languages. Third, the prediction space of cross-lingual NLG is much larger than classification tasks, which makes the knowledge transfer of decoders quite critical.\nPrevious work mainly relies on machine translation (MT) systems to map texts to different languages. The first strand of research directly uses MT in a pipeline manner BIBREF6. For example, the input written in other languages is first translated to English, and fed into the NLG model that is trained by English data. Then the generated English text is translated back to the target language. Another strand of work employs MT to generate pseudo training data for other language pairs that are lack of annotations BIBREF7, BIBREF8. However, such methods have to use multiple MT systems, which renders them suffering from error propagation. Moreover, because the pipeline-based methods do not explicitly share the same parameter space across the languages, we can not directly transfer the task-specific supervision to other low-resource languages.\nIn this paper, we propose a cross-lingual pre-trained model (named as Xnlg) in order to transfer monolingual NLG supervision to other pre-trained languages by fine-tuning. Specifically, Xnlg shares the same sequence-to-sequence model across languages, and is pre-trained with both monolingual and cross-lingual objectives. The model not only learns to understand multilingual input, but also is able to generate specific languages by conditioning on the encoded semantics. Figure FIGREF2 demonstrates how to use Xnlg to perform cross-lingual transfer for downstream tasks. The proposed model enables us to fine-tune the pre-trained model on monolingual NLG training data, and then evaluate it beyond a single language, including zero-shot cross-lingual generation. Besides, we explore several fine-tuning strategies to make a compromise between cross-lingual ability and task ability. In addition, we introduce two cross-lingual NLG datasets (i.e., question generation, and abstractive summarization) for evaluation, which includes three languages, namely English, Chinese, and French. Experimental results on the NLG tasks show that Xnlg achieves competitive performance compared with the machine-translation-based pipeline model in zero-shot cross-lingual settings.\nSeveral previous methods have been proposed for cross-lingual abstractive summarization. BIBREF7 xnhg and BIBREF8 xsummacl use translated documents or summaries as pseudo training data. BIBREF9 ncls incorporate monolingual summarization and machine translation in the training procedure to improve cross-lingual summarization. However, the systems only conduct experiments that generate summaries with different languages from the input language, rather than transferring supervision signals across all language pairs. BIBREF10 kumar2019cross introduce a cross-lingual model for question generation, which uses training data annotated in multiple languages to jointly train a sequence-to-sequence model. In contrast, our method can also be applied to zero-shot settings across languages.\nVarious training objectives are designed to pretrain text encoders used for general-purpose language representations, such as language modeling BIBREF11, BIBREF12, BIBREF13, BIBREF14, BIBREF15, auto-encoding BIBREF16, and machine translation BIBREF17. Apart from pre-training encoders, several pre-trained models BIBREF18, BIBREF19 are proposed for generation tasks. In comparison, our goal is to investigate a pre-training method for cross-lingual NLG tasks.\nCross-lingual pre-training aims at building universal cross-lingual encoders that can encode multilingual sentences to a shared embedding space. BIBREF20 artetxe2018massively use the sequence encoder of the multilingual translation model BIBREF3 to produce cross-lingual sentence embeddings. However, as shown in the experiments (Section SECREF4), it is difficult to control the target language by directly fine-tuning the pre-trained translation model on downstream NLG tasks. BIBREF4 xnli propose an alignment loss function to encourage parallel sentences to have similar representations. By pre-training BERT BIBREF13 on corpora of multiple languages, it shows a surprising ability to produce cross-lingual representations BIBREF21. More recently, BIBREF5 xlm extend mask language modeling pre-training to cross-lingual settings, which shows significant improvements on cross-lingual text classification and unsupervised machine translation. By comparison, we pretrain both encoder and decoder for cross-lingual generation tasks, rather than only focusing on encoder.\nXnlg is a pre-trained sequence-to-sequence model, which is based on Transformer BIBREF22. Both the encoder and the decoder are supposed to support multiple languages. Following BIBREF5, we use language tag embeddings to distinguish the source and target languages. Given a sentence and its corresponding language tag, Xnlg encodes the input into vector representations. By conditioning on the encoding vectors and a specific language tag, the decoder generates the output sequence in the target language. Figure FIGREF6 illustrates the pre-training objectives and the pre-training protocol designed for Xnlg.\nThe masked language modeling (MLM) BIBREF13 task, also known as the Cloze task BIBREF23, aims at predicting the randomly masked words according to their context. The objective pretrains the bidirectional encoder to obtain contextual representations. Following BIBREF13, we randomly mask 15% of the tokens in a monolingual sentence. For each masked token, we substitute it with a special token M, a random token, or the unchanged token with a probability of 0.8, 0.1, and 0.1, respectively. Let $x$ denote a sentence from the monolingual training corpus, and $M_{x}$ the set of randomly masked positions. The monolingual MLM loss is defined as: MLM(x) = -i Mxp( xi | xMx) where $x_{\\setminus M_{x}}$ is the masked version of input $x$. Notice that language tags are fed into the model for all pre-training tasks.\nWe use the denoising auto-encoding (DAE) objective BIBREF24 to pretrain the encoder-decoder attention mechanism. Given sentence $x$ from the monolingual corpus, we use three types of noise to obtain the randomly perturbed text $\\hat{x}$. First, the word order is locally shuffled. Second, we randomly drop tokens of the sentence with a probability of $0.1$. Third, we substitute tokens with the special padding token P with a probability of $0.1$. The pre-training objective is to recover the original sentence $x$ by conditioning on $\\hat{x}$. The DAE loss is computed via: DAE(x) = -p(x|x) = -i = 1|x|p(xi | x, x<i) where $x_{<i}$ represents the tokens of previous time steps $x_1,\\cdots ,x_{i-1}$.\nSimilar to monolingual MLM, the masked token prediction task can be extended to cross-lingual settings BIBREF5. To be specific, given a parallel corpus, we concatenate the pair of bilingual sentences $(x,y)$ to a whole sequence, and use it as the input of MLM. The language tags are also fed into the model to indicate the languages of tokens. During training, we adopt the same masking strategy as monolingual MLM. Apart from using monolingual context to predict the masked tokens, XMLM encourages the model to utilize the alignment of bilingual sentences, so that the model learns to map cross-lingual texts into a shared vector space. Similar to eq:mlm, the cross-lingual MLM loss is: XMLM(x,y) = -i Mxp( xi | xMx , yMy)\n-i Myp( yi | xMx , yMy) where $M_x, M_y$ represent the masked positions of $x$ and $y$, respectively.\nIf only DAE is used as the pre-training task for the decoder, we found that the model ignores the target language tag while generating just the same language as the input, caused by the spurious correlation issue BIBREF25. In other words, the DAE loss captures the spurious correlation between the source language tag and the target sentences, but we expect the language of generated sentences can be controlled by the target language tag. To solve the above problem, we use machine translation as the cross-lingual auto-encoding (XAE) task, which decreases mutual information between the target sentences and the source language tag. XAE can be viewed as the multilingual-version DAE task in the sense that both of them recover the sentence by conditioning on the encoded representations. The cross-lingual auto-encoding loss is defined as: XAE(x,y) = -p(y|x) - p(x|y) where $(x,y)$ is a pair of sentences in the parallel corpus.\nAs shown in Figure FIGREF6(b), we propose a two-stage pre-training protocol for Xnlg. The first stage pretrains the encoding components, where the model learns to encode multilingual sentences to a shared embedding space. We consider using MLM and XMLM as the pre-training tasks. The objective of the first stage is to minimize: 1= (x,y) p XMLM(x,y) + x m MLM(x) where ${_{\\textnormal {p}}}$ indicates the parallel corpus, and ${_{\\textnormal {m}}}$ is the monolingual corpus.\nAlthough the pre-trained encoder in the first stage enables the model to encode multilingual sentences. However, it cannot directly be used in cross-lingual NLG because: 1) encoder-decoder attention is not pre-trained; 2) the decoding algorithm is different between masked language modeling and autoregressive decoding, resulting in the mismatch between pre-training and fine-tuning. Therefore, we conduct decoding pre-training in the second stage by using DAE and XAE as the tasks. Besides, we only update decoder parameters and keep the encoder fixed. The objective of the second stage is to minimize: 2 = (x,y) pXAE(x,y) + x mDAE(x)\nIn the fine-tuning procedure, let us assume that we only have English training data for downstream NLG tasks. According to whether the target language is English, the directions of NLG can be categorized into two classes: any languages to non-English languages (Any-to-Others), and any languages to English (Any-to-English).\nIdeally, the model can be fine-tuned towards a new task without losing its cross-lingual ability. However, we observe the catastrophic forgetting phenomenon of target language controllability, if we fine-tune all the model parameters for Any-to-Others NLG. So we keep the decoder and word embeddings frozen and only update the encoder parameters during fine-tuning. In practice, we found that the proposed fine-tuning method prevents the model from only decoding English words for the Any-to-Others setting.\nFor the Any-to-English NLG transfer, the decoder always generates English. So we can freeze the encoder parameters, and update the decoder parameters to retain the cross-lingual ability. As an alternative way, we can also fine-tune all the parameters to obtain the best results on the English dataset while having a slight drop in performance.\nWe conduct experiments over two cross-lingual NLG downstream tasks, i.e., cross-lingual question generation, and cross-lingual abstractive summarization. We compare Xnlg with state-of-the-art cross-lingual pre-trained models, and machine-translation-based pipelines.\nWe use a pre-trained Xnlg with a 10-layer encoder and a 6-layer decoder. For every Transformer layer, we use 1024 hidden units, 8 attention heads, and GELU activations BIBREF26. In the first pre-training stage, we directly use the 15-language pre-trained XLM BIBREF5 to initialize the parameters of our encoder and decoder. In the second stage, we use Wikipedia as the monolingual data for the DAE objective, and MultiUN BIBREF27 as the parallel data for the XAE objective. The DAE loss is trained with a weight of $0.5$. We train a two-language (English/Chinese) and a three-language (English/French/Chinese) Xnlg for two downstream NLG tasks, respectively. Following BIBREF5, we use the tokenizer provided by BIBREF28 for Chinese, and Moses for other languages, respectively. Then the words in all languages are split with a shared subword vocabulary learned by BPE BIBREF29. We use Adam optimizer with a linear warm-up over the first 4,000 steps and linear decay for later steps, and the learning rate is set to $10^{-4}$. The pre-training batch size is 64, and the sequence length is set to 256. It takes about 30 hours to run 23,000 steps for the pre-training procedure by using 4 Nvidia Telsa V100-16GB GPUs.\nFor fine-tuning on downstream NLG tasks, we use Adam optimizer with a learning rate of $5\\times 10^{-6}$. We set the batch size as 16 and 32 for question generation and abstractive summarization, respectively. When the target language is the same as the language of training data, we fine-tune all parameters. When the target language is different from the language of training data, we fine-tune the Transformer layers of the encoder. We truncate the input sentences to the first 256 tokens. During decoding, we use beam search with beam size of 3, and limit the length of the target sequence to 80 tokens.\nWe evaluate our model on the zero-shot cross-lingual answer-aware question generation task. The goal of question generation (QG) is to generate a question that asks towards the answer with the given passage and the expected answer. In the following experiments, we extend the QG task to the cross-lingual setting. By only using English QG training data, our goal is to generate questions in English or Chinese with the given passage-answer pair in English or Chinese.\nWe use SQuAD 1.1 BIBREF30 as the English QG dataset. It is a popular English question answering dataset containing over 100,000 questions and their corresponding annotated passages. Following BIBREF31, we regard the original development set as the test set, and sample 5000 examples from the training data of two datasets as the development sets. For Chinese QG, we follow the default data splits of WebQA BIBREF32. We regard the provided annotated evidence sentences as the input passages instead of entire documents. To construct the input sequence, we view the whole input passage as a single sentence, and concatenate the passage and the answer into one sequence with a special token S between them. During decoding Chinese, we utilize a subset of vocabulary, which is obtained from the passage sentences of the WebQA dataset.\nWe first conduct experiments on the supervised English-English QG setting. We compare our model to the following baselines:\nCorefNqg BIBREF33 A sequence-to-sequence model with attention mechanism and a feature-rich encoder.\nMp-Gsn BIBREF31 A sequence-to-sequence model with gated self-attention and maxout pointer mechanism.\nXlm BIBREF5 The current state-of-the-art cross-lingual pre-training model. We initialize the Transformer-based sequence-to-sequence model with pre-trained XLM.\nWe evaluate models with BLEU-4 (BL-4), ROUGE (RG) and METEOR (MTR) metrics. As shown in Table TABREF16, our model outperforms the baselines, which demonstrates that our pre-trained model provides a good initialization for NLG.\nWe conduct experiments on the zero-shot Chinese-Chinese QG task to evaluate the cross-lingual transfer ability. In this task, models are trained with English QG data but evaluated with Chinese QG examples. We include the following models as our baselines:\nXlm Fine-tuning XLM with the English QG data.\nPipeline (Xlm) The pipeline of translating input Chinese sentences into English first, then performing En-En-QG with the XLM model, and finally translating back to the Chinese. We use the Transformer as the translator, which is also trained on the MultiUN dataset.\nPipeline (Xlm) with Google Translator Same to Pipeline (Xlm) but using Google Translator to translate the texts.\nWe evaluate models by both automatic evaluation metrics and human experts. The automatic metrics scores are computed by regarding each Chinese character as a token. For human evaluation, we consider three metrics for the generated questions: relatedness, fluency, and correctness, which are represented as integers ranged from 1 to 3. We randomly select 100 passage-answer pairs from the English QG test set, and use the models to generate questions. Then we present these examples to three experts to ask for the above scores. In Table TABREF17 and Table TABREF18, we present the results for the zero-shot Zh-Zh-QG. The results of monolingual supervised models are also reported in Table TABREF16 as reference. In the automatic evaluation, our model consistently performs better than baselines in both zero-shot and monolingual supervised setting. In the human evaluation, our model also obtains significant improvements in terms of relatedness and correctness.\nIn the zero-shot English-Chinese question generation experiments, we use Xlm and Pipeline (Xlm) as our baselines. Pipeline (Xlm) is a pipeline method that uses En-En-QG with Xlm to generate questions, and then translates the results to Chinese. Because there is no annotations for En-Zh-QG, we perform human evaluation studies for this setting. Table TABREF19 shows the human evaluation results, where our model surpasses all the baselines especially in terms of relatedness and correctness.\nWe also conduct experiments for zero-shot Chinese-English question generation, and adopt the same evaluation procedure to En-Zh-QG. Pipeline (Xlm) first translates Chinese input to English, and then conduct En-En-QG with Xlm. As shown in Table TABREF20, human evaluation results indicate that Xnlg achieves significant improvements on the three metrics.\nWe conduct experiments on cross-lingual abstractive summarization (AS). AS is the task of converting the input sentences into summaries while preserving the key meanings. For evaluation, we use English/French/Chinese Gigaword to extract the first sentence and the headline of each article, and regard them as input document and predicted summaries, respectively. For each language, we sample 500k/5k/5k examples for training/validation/test.\nIn the zero-shot setting, we only use English data for training, and directly evaluate the model on other languages. In Table TABREF22 and Table TABREF23, we present the results for French/Chinese AS, which are evaluated by the ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2 and ROUGE-L metrics. We also report the results of supervised AS in Table TABREF21 for reference. We find that Xnlg outperforms all the baseline models on both French and Chinese AS. Comparing with French, there is a larger gap between baselines and our model on zero-shot Chinese AS, which indicates that the error propagation issue is more serious on distant language pairs.\nWe conduct ablation studies for pre-training objectives, and the results can be seen in Table TABREF40. We observe that our model greatly benefits from the DAE objective for the zero-shot Chinese question generation task. The results also demonstrate that combining DAE and XAE can alleviate the spurious correlation issue and improves cross-lingual NLG.\nAs shown in Table TABREF41, we use the En-En-QG and Zh-Zh-QG tasks to analyze the effects of using different fine-tuning strategies. It can be observed that fine-tuning encoder parameters, our model obtain an impressive performance for both English and Chinese QG, which shows the strong cross-lingual transfer ability of our model. When fine-tuning all the parameters, the model achieves the best score for English QG, but it suffers a performance drop when evaluating on Chinese QG. We find that fine-tuning decoder hurts cross-lingual decoding, and the model learns to only decodes English words. For only fine-tuning decoder, the performance degrades by a large margin for both languages because of the underfitting issue, which indicates the necessity of fine-tuning encoder.\nWe examine whether low-resource NLG can benefit from cross-lingual transfer. We consider English as the rich-resource language, and conduct experiments for few-shot French/Chinese AS. Specifically, we first fine-tune Xnlg on the English AS data, and then fine-tune it on the French or Chinese AS data. We compare with the monolingual supervised model that Xnlg is only fine-tuned on the dataset of the target language. As shown in Figure FIGREF49, we can observe that the cross-lingual supervision improves performance for few-shot abstractive summarization. As the training data size becomes larger, the performance of two models is getting closer.\nAs shown in Figure FIGREF42, we present some examples generated by Xnlg and the baselines in four directions (En-En, En-Zh, Zh-En, and Zh-Zh). When decoding on an unseen language, Xlm tends to generate random output, because it is not designed for cross-lingual NLG. In terms of the pipeline model, we can observe that it suffers from the error propagation issue, especially when the source and target languages are all different from the training data. For example, when the pipeline model performs Zh-Zh-QG, keywords are translated twice, increasing the risk of mistranslation. In the second example, \u201catomic bomb\u201d is mistranslated to \u201cnuclear bomb\u201d, resulting in its low correctness. On the contrary, by directly transferring English supervision signals to the other generation directions, the generated questions of Xnlg match the references better than baselines.\nIn this paper, we propose a pre-training method for cross-lingual natural language generation (NLG) that can transfer monolingual NLG supervision signals to all pre-trained languages. With the pre-trained model, we achieve zero-shot cross-lingual NLG on several languages by only fine-tuning once. Experimental results show that our model outperforms the machine-translation-based pipeline model on several cross-lingual NLG tasks. For future work, we would like to improve our pre-training method towards the fully unsupervised setting.", "question": "What languages do they use during pretraining?", "expected_output": "English.

Similar to eq:mlm, the cross-lingual MLM loss is: XMLM(x,y) = -i Mxp( xi | xMx , yMy)\n-i Myp( yi | xMx , yMy) where $M_x, M_y$ represent the masked positions of $x$ and $y$, respectively.\nIf only DAE is used as the pre-training task for the decoder, we found that the model ignores the target language tag while generating just the same language as the input, caused by the spurious correlation issue BIBREF25. In other words, the DAE loss captures the spurious correlation between the source language tag and the target sentences, but we expect the language of generated sentences can be controlled by the target language tag. To solve the above problem, we use machine translation as the cross-lingual auto-encoding (XAE) task, which decreases mutual information between the target sentences and the source language tag. XAE can be viewed as the multilingual-version DAE task in the sense that both of them recover the sentence by conditioning on the encoded representations. The cross-lingual auto-encoding loss is defined as: XAE(x,y) = -p(y|x) - p(x|y) where $(x,y)$ is a pair of sentences in the parallel corpus.\nAs shown in Figure FIGREF6(b), we propose a two-stage pre-training protocol for Xnlg. The first stage pretrains the encoding components, where the model learns to encode multilingual sentences to a shared embedding space. We consider using MLM and XMLM as the pre-training tasks. The objective of the first stage is to minimize: 1= (x,y) p XMLM(x,y) + x m MLM(x) where ${_{\\textnormal {p}}}$ indicates the parallel corpus, and ${_{\\textnormal {m}}}$ is the monolingual corpus.\nAlthough the pre-trained encoder in the first stage enables the model to encode multilingual sentences. However, it cannot directly be used in cross-lingual NLG because: 1) encoder-decoder attention is not pre-trained; 2) the decoding algorithm is different between masked language modeling and autoregressive decoding, resulting in the mismatch between pre-training and fine-tuning. Therefore, we conduct decoding pre-training in the second stage by using DAE and XAE as the tasks. Besides, we only update decoder parameters and keep the encoder fixed. The objective of the second stage is to minimize: 2 = (x,y) pXAE(x,y) + x mDAE(x)\nIn the fine-tuning procedure, let us assume that we only have English training data for downstream NLG tasks. According to whether the target language is English, the directions of NLG can be categorized into two classes: any languages to non-English languages (Any-to-Others), and any languages to English (Any-to-English).\nIdeally, the model can be fine-tuned towards a new task without losing its cross-lingual ability. However, we observe the catastrophic forgetting phenomenon of target language controllability, if we fine-tune all the model parameters for Any-to-Others NLG. So we keep the decoder and word embeddings frozen and only update the encoder parameters during fine-tuning. In practice, we found that the proposed fine-tuning method prevents the model from only decoding English words for the Any-to-Others setting.\nFor the Any-to-English NLG transfer, the decoder always generates English. So we can freeze the encoder parameters, and update the decoder parameters to retain the cross-lingual ability. As an alternative way, we can also fine-tune all the parameters to obtain the best results on the English dataset while having a slight drop in performance.\nWe conduct experiments over two cross-lingual NLG downstream tasks, i.e., cross-lingual question generation, and cross-lingual abstractive summarization. We compare Xnlg with state-of-the-art cross-lingual pre-trained models, and machine-translation-based pipelines.\nWe use a pre-trained Xnlg with a 10-layer encoder and a 6-layer decoder. For every Transformer layer, we use 1024 hidden units, 8 attention heads, and GELU activations BIBREF26. In the first pre-training stage, we directly use the 15-language pre-trained XLM BIBREF5 to initialize the parameters of our encoder and decoder. In the second stage, we use Wikipedia as the monolingual data for the DAE objective, and MultiUN BIBREF27 as the parallel data for the XAE objective. The DAE loss is trained with a weight of $0.5$. We train a two-language (English/Chinese) and a three-language (English/French/Chinese) Xnlg for two downstream NLG tasks, respectively. Following BIBREF5, we use the tokenizer provided by BIBREF28 for Chinese, and Moses for other languages, respectively. Then the words in all languages are split with a shared subword vocabulary learned by BPE BIBREF29. We use Adam optimizer with a linear warm-up over the first 4,000 steps and linear decay for later steps, and the learning rate is set to $10^{-4}$. The pre-training batch size is 64, and the sequence length is set to 256. It takes about 30 hours to run 23,000 steps for the pre-training procedure by using 4 Nvidia Telsa V100-16GB GPUs.\nFor fine-tuning on downstream NLG tasks, we use Adam optimizer with a learning rate of $5\\times 10^{-6}$. We set the batch size as 16 and 32 for question generation and abstractive summarization, respectively. When the target language is the same as the language of training data, we fine-tune all parameters. When the target language is different from the language of training data, we fine-tune the Transformer layers of the encoder. We truncate the input sentences to the first 256 tokens. During decoding, we use beam search with beam size of 3, and limit the length of the target sequence to 80 tokens.\nWe evaluate our model on the zero-shot cross-lingual answer-aware question generation task. The goal of question generation (QG) is to generate a question that asks towards the answer with the given passage and the expected answer. In the following experiments, we extend the QG task to the cross-lingual setting. By only using English QG training data, our goal is to generate questions in English or Chinese with the given passage-answer pair in English or Chinese.\nWe use SQuAD 1.1 BIBREF30 as the English QG dataset. It is a popular English question answering dataset containing over 100,000 questions and their corresponding annotated passages. Following BIBREF31, we regard the original development set as the test set, and sample 5000 examples from the training data of two datasets as the development sets. For Chinese QG, we follow the default data splits of WebQA BIBREF32. We regard the provided annotated evidence sentences as the input passages instead of entire documents. To construct the input sequence, we view the whole input passage as a single sentence, and concatenate the passage and the answer into one sequence with a special token S between them. During decoding Chinese, we utilize a subset of vocabulary, which is obtained from the passage sentences of the WebQA dataset.\nWe first conduct experiments on the supervised English-English QG setting. We compare our model to the following baselines:\nCorefNqg BIBREF33 A sequence-to-sequence model with attention mechanism and a feature-rich encoder.\nMp-Gsn BIBREF31 A sequence-to-sequence model with gated self-attention and maxout pointer mechanism.\nXlm BIBREF5 The current state-of-the-art cross-lingual pre-training model. We initialize the Transformer-based sequence-to-sequence model with pre-trained XLM.\nWe evaluate models with BLEU-4 (BL-4), ROUGE (RG) and METEOR (MTR) metrics. As shown in Table TABREF16, our model outperforms the baselines, which demonstrates that our pre-trained model provides a good initialization for NLG.\nWe conduct experiments on the zero-shot Chinese-Chinese QG task to evaluate the cross-lingual transfer ability. In this task, models are trained with English QG data but evaluated with Chinese QG examples. We include the following models as our baselines:\nXlm Fine-tuning XLM with the English QG data.\nPipeline (Xlm) The pipeline of translating input Chinese sentences into English first, then performing En-En-QG with the XLM model, and finally translating back to the Chinese. We use the Transformer as the translator, which is also trained on the MultiUN dataset.\nPipeline (Xlm) with Google Translator Same to Pipeline (Xlm) but using Google Translator to translate the texts.\nWe evaluate models by both automatic evaluation metrics and human experts. The automatic metrics scores are computed by regarding each Chinese character as a token. For human evaluation, we consider three metrics for the generated questions: relatedness, fluency, and correctness, which are represented as integers ranged from 1 to 3. We randomly select 100 passage-answer pairs from the English QG test set, and use the models to generate questions. Then we present these examples to three experts to ask for the above scores. In Table TABREF17 and Table TABREF18, we present the results for the zero-shot Zh-Zh-QG. The results of monolingual supervised models are also reported in Table TABREF16 as reference. In the automatic evaluation, our model consistently performs better than baselines in both zero-shot and monolingual supervised setting. In the human evaluation, our model also obtains significant improvements in terms of relatedness and correctness.\nIn the zero-shot English-Chinese question generation experiments, we use Xlm and Pipeline (Xlm) as our baselines. Pipeline (Xlm) is a pipeline method that uses En-En-QG with Xlm to generate questions, and then translates the results to Chinese. Because there is no annotations for En-Zh-QG, we perform human evaluation studies for this setting. Table TABREF19 shows the human evaluation results, where our model surpasses all the baselines especially in terms of relatedness and correctness.\nWe also conduct experiments for zero-shot Chinese-English question generation, and adopt the same evaluation procedure to En-Zh-QG. Pipeline (Xlm) first translates Chinese input to English, and then conduct En-En-QG with Xlm. As shown in Table TABREF20, human evaluation results indicate that Xnlg achieves significant improvements on the three metrics.\nWe conduct experiments on cross-lingual abstractive summarization (AS). AS is the task of converting the input sentences into summaries while preserving the key meanings. For evaluation, we use English/French/Chinese Gigaword to extract the first sentence and the headline of each article, and regard them as input document and predicted summaries, respectively. For each language, we sample 500k/5k/5k examples for training/validation/test.\nIn the zero-shot setting, we only use English data for training, and directly evaluate the model on other languages. In Table TABREF22 and Table TABREF23, we present the results for French/Chinese AS, which are evaluated by the ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2 and ROUGE-L metrics. We also report the results of supervised AS in Table TABREF21 for reference. We find that Xnlg outperforms all the baseline models on both French and Chinese AS. Comparing with French, there is a larger gap between baselines and our model on zero-shot Chinese AS, which indicates that the error propagation issue is more serious on distant language pairs.\nWe conduct ablation studies for pre-training objectives, and the results can be seen in Table TABREF40. We observe that our model greatly benefits from the DAE objective for the zero-shot Chinese question generation task. The results also demonstrate that combining DAE and XAE can alleviate the spurious correlation issue and improves cross-lingual NLG.\nAs shown in Table TABREF41, we use the En-En-QG and Zh-Zh-QG tasks to analyze the effects of using different fine-tuning strategies. It can be observed that fine-tuning encoder parameters, our model obtain an impressive performance for both English and Chinese QG, which shows the strong cross-lingual transfer ability of our model. When fine-tuning all the parameters, the model achieves the best score for English QG, but it suffers a performance drop when evaluating on Chinese QG. We find that fine-tuning decoder hurts cross-lingual decoding, and the model learns to only decodes English words. For only fine-tuning decoder, the performance degrades by a large margin for both languages because of the underfitting issue, which indicates the necessity of fine-tuning encoder.\nWe examine whether low-resource NLG can benefit from cross-lingual transfer. We consider English as the rich-resource language, and conduct experiments for few-shot French/Chinese AS. Specifically, we first fine-tune Xnlg on the English AS data, and then fine-tune it on the French or Chinese AS data. We compare with the monolingual supervised model that Xnlg is only fine-tuned on the dataset of the target language. As shown in Figure FIGREF49, we can observe that the cross-lingual supervision improves performance for few-shot abstractive summarization. As the training data size becomes larger, the performance of two models is getting closer.\nAs shown in Figure FIGREF42, we present some examples generated by Xnlg and the baselines in four directions (En-En, En-Zh, Zh-En, and Zh-Zh). When decoding on an unseen language, Xlm tends to generate random output, because it is not designed for cross-lingual NLG. In terms of the pipeline model, we can observe that it suffers from the error propagation issue, especially when the source and target languages are all different from the training data. For example, when the pipeline model performs Zh-Zh-QG, keywords are translated twice, increasing the risk of mistranslation. In the second example, \u201catomic bomb\u201d is mistranslated to \u201cnuclear bomb\u201d, resulting in its low correctness. On the contrary, by directly transferring English supervision signals to the other generation directions, the generated questions of Xnlg match the references better than baselines.\nIn this paper, we propose a pre-training method for cross-lingual natural language generation (NLG) that can transfer monolingual NLG supervision signals to all pre-trained languages. With the pre-trained model, we achieve zero-shot cross-lingual NLG on several languages by only fine-tuning once. Experimental results show that our model outperforms the machine-translation-based pipeline model on several cross-lingual NLG tasks. For future work, we would like to improve our pre-training method towards the fully unsupervised setting.", "question": "What is the architecture of the decoder?", "expected_output": "pre-trained Xnlg.
